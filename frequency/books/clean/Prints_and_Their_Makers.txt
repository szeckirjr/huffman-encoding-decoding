The plan of this book is a simple one. Certainlovers of prints have been asked to write on the engravers, etchers,or periods which chiefly interest them and upon which they are bestqualified to speak; and, furthermore, to treat their special subjectsin their own way. So far as subject matter is concerned, the essaysare grouped approximately in chronological order, and the reader mayrange from Italian engravers before the time of Raphael and woodcutsby Albrecht Drer to contemporary etchings by Zorn, Lepre, and HermanA. Webster. Throughout the essays one dominant note will be found--asincere love of Prints and an interest in their Makers.FITZROY CARRINGTON.New York,September, 1912.DRERS WOODCUTSBY CAMPBELL DODGSON, M.A.Keeper of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum Author of theCatalogue of German and Flemish Woodcuts in the British Museum andHonorary Secretary of the Drer SocietyThe first decade of the twentieth century lies not very far behindus, but perhaps it is not too soon to assert that one of its markedfeatures, in the retrospect of a print-lover, is a great revival orextension of interest in every form of engraving among cultivatedpeople who are not specialists. Increased attention has beenpaid, among other things, to the German woodcuts of the fifteenthand sixteenth centuries, which used to be rather despised by theold-fashioned nineteenth-century collector, with a few enlightenedexceptions, as rough and ugly old things which were curious asspecimens of antiquity or instructive as illustrations of the life andreligion of the generations that produced them, but were not to betaken very seriously as works of art. That estimate is being revised.A generation no longer blinded to the merits of primitive art by theworship of Raphael and the antique is ever tapping fresh sources ofdelight and enriching itself by the perception of beauty where itsfathers saw nought but the grotesque and quaint. It is not surprising,indeed, that German art has made slower progress than Italian on theroad to popularity. Even the primitives, on the south side of theAlps, shared in the winning grace and suavity of the old Mediterraneanculture, while their brethren in the North, the French excepted,were indisputably more rugged and barbarous in draughtsmanship andpainting, and few of their engravers, except Schongauer, can vie withthe Florentines if their achievements are judged by the test of formalbeauty. But it is wonderful how, in the North, now and again, art couldsuddenly blossom and ripen under the creative impulse of an innovator,whose successors, rather than the pioneer himself, lay themselves opento the charge of angularity and uncouthness. The perfection of thevery earliest printed books is a commonplace. Less generally known,perhaps, is the great beauty to which the earliest of all the Germanengravers known to us at all as a personality, though not by name,was capable of attaining. The Master of the Playing-Cards, who wasat work about 1430-40, produced work of extraordinary charm, not onlyin some of the figures, animals and flowers of the playing-cardsthemselves, but especially in the large engraving of the Virgin Marywith the human-headed serpent, or Lilith, beneath her feet, whichis one of the most splendid and mature creations of the fifteenthcentury. Then, again, the early book illustrators of Augsburg andUlm, in the seventies, when the use of blocks for such a purpose hadonly recently come in, produced woodcuts that were never surpassedby any successors in their simple and direct vivacity and strength,with the utmost economy of line. But the real beauty of some of themuch earlier single woodcuts, illustrating, chiefly, the legends ofOur Lady and the Saints, has been much less generally appreciated.They are very rare, and most of them repose, in a seclusion seldomdisturbed, in their boxes in the great European print-rooms or evenin monastic libraries. They are only beginning to be reproduced, andthey are rarely exhibited. But such an exhibition of the earliestGerman woodcuts as was held at Berlin in the summer of 1908 was trulya revelation. The soft and rounded features, the flowing lines of thedrapery, in the prints of the generation before sharp, broken foldswere introduced under the influence of the Netherlands, have somethingof the charm of Far Eastern art, and the gay coloring with which mostof the prints were finished has often a delightfully decorative effectwhen they are framed and hung at a proper distance from the eye. Suchpraise is due, of course, only to some of the choicer examples; thereare plenty of fifteenth-century woodcuts in which the line is merelyclumsy and the coloring merely gaudy, but these are more often productsof the last quarter of the century than of its beginning or middle.It would not be true to say that the advance of time brought with itprogress and perfection in the woodcutters art; on the contrary,the first vital impulse spent itself all too soon, and gave way tothoughtless and unintelligent imitation.[Illustration: Albrecht Drer Conterfeyt in seinem alterDes L V I.

THE FOUR RIDERS OF THE APOCALYPSEFrom The ApocalypseSize of the original woodcut, 15  11 inches]What was the state of things when Drer appeared upon the scene?He did so long before the close of the fifteenth century, for hisfirst authenticated woodcut is an illustration to St. JeromesEpistles, printed at Basle in 1492. Whether he or an unknown artistis responsible for a large number of other illustrations producedat Basle about 1493-95, is a question about which no consensus ofopinion has been formed, and this is not the place to discuss it. Allthe woodcuts that the world knows and esteems as Drers were producedat Nuremberg after his return from the first Venetian journey (1495).Let us see, for a moment, how they stand comparison with what hadgone before them. The older woodcuts are nearly all anonymous, and ifthey bear any signature, it is that of a woodcutter (Formschneideror Briefmaler) who was a craftsman allied to the joiner, rather thanthe painter. Just before Drers time the painter begins to make hisappearance on the scene as a designer of woodcuts. There are a fewisolated cases in which the almost universal rule of anonymity isbroken, and we learn from the preface to a book the name of the artistwho designed the illustrations. Breydenbachs Travels to the HolyLand (Mainz, 1486) was illustrated by woodcuts after Erhard Reuwich,or Rewich, a native of Utrecht, who had accompanied the author onhis journey, and the immense number of woodcuts in the NurembergChronicle by Hartmann Schedel (1493) were the work of the paintersWohlgemuth and Pleydenwurff; to whom the much finer illustrations ofthe Schatzbehalter (1491) may also safely be attributed. It is nowalmost universally believed that the Master of the Hausbuch, one ofDrers most gifted predecessors in the art of engraving on copper, wasalso a prolific illustrator, the principal work assigned to him beingthe numerous illustrations in the Spiegel der menschlichen Behaltnisprinted by Peter Drach at Speyer about 1478-80. There are speculations,more or less ill-founded, about the illustrators of a few other woodcutbooks of the fifteenth century, but I believe it is true that thefirst book after those already named in which the artists name issettled beyond doubt is Drers Apocalypse of 1498.[Illustration: DRER. THE WHORE OF BABYLON, SEATED UPON THE BEAST WITHSEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNSFrom The ApocalypseSize of the original woodcut, 15  11 inches][Illustration: DRER. CHRIST BEARING HIS CROSSFrom The Great PassionSize of the original woodcut, 15  11 inches]Dr. Naumann, the editor of a recent facsimile of the cuts in theSpeyer book just mentioned, claims for the Hausbuchmeister that hewas the first painter, or painter-engraver, who attempted to get themost out of the craftsmen employed in cutting blocks from his designs.That is rather a speculative opinion, and the woodcuts in questionare not, from the technical point of view, superior to many othercontemporary illustrations. But there can be no question that Drereffected an immense reform in this respect, and carried the techniqueof wood-engraving to a perfection unparalleled in its previous history.Not by his own handiwork, for there is no reason to suppose that Drerever cut his blocks himself. All the evidence points, on the contrary,to his having followed the universal practice of the time, accordingto which the designer drew the composition in all detail upon thewood block, and employed a professional engraver to cut the block,preserving all the lines intact, and cutting away the spaces betweenthem, so that the result was a facsimile of the drawing as accurate asthe craftsman was capable of making it. Drer set his engravers, we maybe sure, a harder task than they had ever had to grapple with before,and he must have succeeded in gradually training a man, or group ofmen, on whom he could rely to preserve his drawing in all its delicacyand intricate complexity. This was a work of time, and perfectionwas not reached till after Drers return from his second journey toVenice, when a great increase of refinement on the technical sidebecomes noticeable, culminating in that extraordinary performance, the_Holy Trinity_ woodcut of 1511. But even in the large fifteenth-centuryblocks, the Apocalypse, the earlier portion of the Great Passionand the contemporary single subjects, much cross-hatching is usedand the space is filled with detail to an extent hitherto unknown.Without ever losing sight of the general decorative effect, the tellingpattern of black and white, Drer put in a vast amount of interestinglittle things, with the conscientiousness and care that characterizedeverything that he did, and every detail of the leaves of a thistle orfern, or of the elaborate ornament, birds and flowers and foliage andrams heads, on the base of a Gothic candle-stick, had to be reproducedso that the crisp clearness of the original pen-drawing lost nothing ofits precision. The result was a work so perfectly complete in black andwhite, as it stood, that nobody ever thought of coloring it, and thatin itself was a great innovation and advance. The fifteenth-centuryIlluminirer, or the patron who gave him his orders, seems to havehad an instinctive respect for excellent and highly finished work inblack and white, which made him leave it alone. Line-engravings ofthe fifteenth century are very frequently found colored, but they areusually quite second-rate specimens, and prints by the great men,such as the Master E. S. and Schongauer, were respected and leftalone. But such consideration was not often shown to woodcuts, whichwere frequently colored, especially when used as illustrations, wellinto the sixteenth century. It was very rarely, however, that anyilluminator laid profane hands on anything of Drers, woodcut orengraving, and when he did so the result is stupid and disagreeable,for it is always the work of a later generation, out of touch withDrers genius.[Illustration: DRER. THE RESURRECTIONFrom The Great PassionSize of the original woodcut, 15  10 inches][Illustration: DRER. SAMSON AND THE LIONSize of the original woodcut, 15  10 inches]It may be said that if Drer and his contemporaries did not cut theirown blocks, the woodcuts are not original prints by the mastersthemselves. It must be conceded that they are not original prints quitein the same sense as engravings and etchings, in which the whole workwas carried out upon the plate by the masters own hand, but it wouldbe a mistake to describe them as examples of reproductive engraving.Such a thing as a reproductive engraving was, in fact, unknown inthe Germany of Drers time. A design originally projected in onemedium might be reproduced in another in a case where an engraving bySchongauer, or Meckenen, or Drer himself, was copied by some inferiorwoodcutter, as an act of piracy, for a bookseller who was too stingyto pay an artist to draw him a new Virgin or Saint for his purpose.But it would never have occurred to any one to reproduce an engravingor woodcut, a picture or drawing, done for its own sake, as a separateand complete work of art. Reproductions of pictures scarcely existin German art of the sixteenth century; they are commoner in theVenetian School, among the woodcutters influenced by Titian, and Rubensestablished the practice once for all by his encouragement of engravingfrom his pictures, a century after Drers time. But when woodcuttingwas taken up by the German painters, with Drer as their leader, forthe purpose of circulating their compositions at a cheaper price thanthey could charge for engravings of their own, they always had astrictly legitimate object according to the canons of graphic art.Rarely working even from sketches, never from a work already finishedin another medium, they drew the subjects intended for printingdirectly upon the block in a technique adapted for the purpose,avoiding such combinations of lines as the most skilful craftsmenwould be unable to cut. Their actual handiwork was preserved upon thesurface of the block, much as in the modern original lithograph theartists actual work survives upon the surface of the stone; if itwas in any way disfigured, as often, no doubt, it was, that must beset down to failure on the cutters part. Anything original that thecutter puts in, any swerving that accident or clumsiness permits himto make from the line fixed by the painters pen for him to follow, isa blemish, and the best woodcuts of Drer, Holbein, Baldung, Cranach,Burgkmair and the rest of their generation have no such blemishes. Theyare strictly autographic: the lines that the artists pen has tracedremain and are immortalized by the printing-press; the white spaces,also limited by his controlling will and purpose, result from the meremechanical cutting away of blank wood that any neat-handed workmancan perform. So when we speak of the woodcuts of Millais, Rossetti,Whistler, Walker, Pinwell, Sandys and the rest of the Men of theSixties, we know that the blocks were cut by Dalziel or Swain, butevery good print is none the less what the designer meant it to be, andwhat none but himself could have made it.[Illustration: DRER. THE ANNUNCIATION TO JOACHIMFrom The Life of the VirginSize of the original woodcut, 11  8/ inches][Illustration: DRER. THE ANNUNCIATIONFrom The Life of the VirginSize of the original woodcut, 11  8 inches]Of Drers woodcutters, unluckily, we know nothing till thecomparatively late period when he had been enlisted in the serviceof the Emperor Maximilian, whose imposing, but somewhat ponderous andpedantic, _Triumphal Arch_ was cut from the designs of Drer and hisschool by Hieronymus Andre. There is much more information about theAugsburg cutters than about those of Nuremberg, and there is no singleartist in the latter city whose work is so strongly marked out by itsexcellence from that of his contemporaries as was Ltzelburgers, whocut Holbeins Dance of Death.To understand Drers woodcuts aright, it is necessary to get to knowthem in their chronological sequence. In conservative collections,where they are arranged by order of subject, on the system of Bartsch,the student is continually confused by the juxtaposition of quiteincongruous pieces, placed together merely because Jrme, forinstance, comes in alphabetical order next after Jean. The BritishMuseum collection has been arranged for more than ten years past inchronological order, which, in Drers case, is unusually easy todetermine with approximate accuracy, because his methodical turn ofmind caused him to be fond of dates, while the undated pieces canbe fitted in without much difficulty by the evidence of style. Thejustification of the system became all the more apparent when thewoodcuts were exhibited for a few months in 1909, and fell naturallyinto consistent and coherent groups upon the screens, while separated,as a matter of practical convenience, from the engravings. Since thentwo even more interesting experiments have been made, in exhibitionsheld at Liverpool and Bremen, toward a reconstruction of Drersentire life-work in its chronological sequence, his pictures,drawings, engravings and woodcuts--represented mainly, of course,by reproductions--being merged in a single series. That is a timelywarning against the risks of excessive concentration upon one singleside of his many activities, but here we will not digress further fromthe woodcuts, which are at present our theme.[Illustration: DRER. THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPTFrom The Life of the VirginSize of the original woodcut, 11  8 inches][Illustration: DRER. THE ASSUMPTION AND CROWNING OF THE VIRGINFrom The Life of the VirginSize of the original woodcut, 11  8 inches]The series opens magnificently with the group of large and statelywoodcuts, abounding in vitality and dramatic invention, produced byDrer between 1495 and 1500. These include the fifteen subjects of theApocalypse, the seven early subjects of the Great Passion (notcompleted until 1510-11) and seven detached pieces uniform with thetwo series already named in dimensions and style, but independent ofthem in subject. The blocks of the majority of these single piecesare now, by the way, in an American collection, that of Mr. Junius S.Morgan, but they have suffered sadly from the ravages of the worm.There is a certain exaggeration and over-emphasis of gesture in theApocalypse woodcuts, but Drer never invented anything more sublimethan the celebrated _Four Riders_ or the _St. Michael defeating theRebel Angels_, which I regard as at least equal to the subject morefrequently praised. Superb, too, is the group of _Angels restrainingthe Four Winds_. The landscape at the foot of _St. Johns Vision ofthe Four-and-twenty Elders_ (B. 63) is a complete picture by itself,and there is a rare early copy of this portion alone, which is itselfa beautiful print, and doubtless the earliest pure landscape woodcutin existence. _Samson and the Lion_, the mysteriously named _Ercules_and the _Knight and Man-at-arms_, often described as its companion,and the _Martyrdom of St. Catherine_ are among the finest of the singlesubjects. After this tremendously impressive group, there is for atime a certain relaxation of energy, or rather Drer was more benton other things, especially engraving. To the years 1500-04 belonga number of woodcuts of Holy Families and Saints, much smaller thanthe Apocalypse, and rather roughly cut. Some critics have wished todismiss one or another of them as pupils work, but for this there isreally no justification. Then comes another very good period, that ofthe Life of the Virgin, of which set Drer had finished seventeensubjects before he left for Venice in 1505, while the _Death of theVirgin_ and _The Assumption_ were added in 1510, and the frontispiecein 1511, when the whole work came out as a book, assuredly one ofthe most desirable picture-books the world has ever seen! It isimpossible to weary of the beautiful compositions, the details drawnwith such loving care, the tender and homely sentiment, the humor,even, displayed in the accessory figures of _The Embrace of Joachimand Anne_, the beer-drinking gossips in the _Birth of the Virgin_,where the atmosphere of St. Annes chamber is sweetened by an angelicthurifer, and the merry group of angelic children playing round Joseph,bent on his carpenters business, while their elders keep solemn watchround Mary at her distaff and the Holy Child in the cradle. We findlandscapes at least as beautiful as those in Drers best engravingsin the pastoral background of the _Annunciation to Joachim_ and themountainous distance of the _Visitation_. The architectural setting ofthe _Presentation of Christ in the Temple_, and the tall cross heldaloft, with the happiest effect on the composition, by the Apostlekneeling on the left in Marys death-chamber, are among the memorablefeatures of the set.Beautiful again, especially in fine proofs, is the next and latest ofthe long sets, the Little Passion, consisting of thirty-six subjectsand a title-page, begun in 1509 and finished, like all the otherbooks, in 1511. But it has not the monumental grandeur of the earlierreligious sets, and there is an inevitable monotony about the incessantrecurrence of the figure of Our Lord, when the history of the Passionis set forth in such detail. The most original and impressive subjects,in my opinion, are _Christ Appearing to St. Mary Magdalen_ and the nextfollowing it, _The Supper at Emmaus_.[Illustration: DRER. ST. JEROME IN HIS CELLSize of the original woodcut, 9  6 inches][Illustration: DRER. THE HOLY FAMILYSt. Anne, attended by St. Joseph and St. Joachim, receiving from HisMother the Infant JesusSize of the original woodcut, 9  6 inches]The years 1510 and 1511 were the most prolific of all, and witnessedthe publication of other connected pieces, the _Beheading of Johnthe Baptist_ and _Salome bringing the Baptists Head to Herod_, andthen the three little woodcuts, _Christ on the Cross_, _Death and theSoldier_, and _The Schoolmaster_, which Drer brought out on largesheets at the head of his own verses, signed with a large monogramat the end of all. The single sheets of 1511 include, besides themarvelous _Trinity_ already mentioned, the large _Adoration of theMagi_, the _Mass of St. Gregory_, a _St. Jerome in his Cell_, which isthe best, after the celebrated engraving of 1514, of Drers repeatedversions of that delightful subject; the _Cain and Abel_, which is oneof the great rarities; two rather unattractive _Holy Families_; and thebeautiful square _Saint Christopher_, of which many fine impressionsare extant to bear witness to its technical virtues. The averagelevel of all the work of the year 1511 is so astonishingly high, thatit must be regarded as the culminating period of the woodcuts, just asa slightly later time, the years 1513-14, witnesses the climax of theengravings. In the next few years Drers time was much taken up withcarrying out the emperors important but rather tiresome commissionsfor the _Triumphal Arch_ and two _Triumphal Cars_, the small one whichforms part of the _Procession_, and the much bigger affair, with thetwelve horses and allegorical retinue, which did not appear till 1522.All this group offers a rich field of research to the antiquary, butis simply unintelligible without a learned commentary, and appealsmuch less than the sacred subjects to the average collector and loverof art, who cannot unearth the heaps of pedantic Latin and Germanliterature in which the motives by which Drer was inspired, if Imay use the word, lie buried. Inspiration certainly flagged underthe influence of Wilibald Pirkheimer and other learned humanists whoencouraged Maximilian in his penchant for allegory, and compelledDrer, probably somewhat against his will, to use a multitude ofsymbols, intelligible only to the learned, instead of speaking directlyto the populace in the familiar pictorial language derived from oldtradition but enriched and ennobled by his own matchless art.The later woodcuts are comparatively few in number. They include afew that are primarily of scientific interest, such as the celestialand terrestrial globes and the armillary sphere, besides the numerousillustrations to Drers own works on Measurement, Proportion, andFortification. But among them are the two splendid portraits made fromdrawings now in the Albertina, the _Emperor Maximilian_ of 1518 andthe _Ulrich Varnbler_ of 1522. Of the former several varieties exist,from no less than four different blocks, and it is now established thatthe only original version is the very rare one in which the lettersae of the word Caesar are distinct, not forming a diphthong, andplaced within the large C. The other cuts are all copies, producedprobably at Augsburg, the fine large one, with an ornamental frame andthe imperial arms supported by griffins, being indisputably the work ofHans Weiditz. Only three impressions of the original are known, in theBritish Museum, the Berlin Kupferstichkabinett, and the Hofbibliothekat Vienna, in addition to which the cole des Beaux-Arts at Parispossesses a fragment damaged by fire at the time of the Commune, whenit was still in private hands. It is more generally known that thehandsome chiaroscuro impressions of the _Varnbler_ date, like thoseof the _Rhinoceros_, from the seventeenth century, the color blockshaving been added in Holland. The brown and green varieties belong todifferent editions, distinguished by the wording of the publishersaddress at the foot, which in the majority of cases has been cut off.[Illustration: DRER. SAINT CHRISTOPHERSize of the original woodcut, 8  8 inches][Illustration: DRER. THE VIRGIN WITH THE MANY ANGELSSize of the original woodcut, 11/  8 inches]The _Virgin with the many Angels_, of 1518, is one of Drersmost accomplished woodcuts, and quite good impressions of it arecomparatively common to-day. The latest of his compositions of thisclass, the _Holy Family with Angels_, of 1526, is, on the otherhand, extremely rare. Some critics doubt its being an authentic workof Drer, but in spite of certain rather eccentric and unpleasantpeculiarities in the drawing, I consider this scepticism unfounded.Quite at the end of Drers life comes that rather fascinating subject,_The Siege of a Fortress_, unique among Drers woodcuts in the tinyscale on which its countless details are drawn. Of the many heraldicwoodcuts and ex-libris attributed by Bartsch and others to Drer, veryfew can be regarded as his genuine work, and most of these are veryrare. The best authenticated are his own coat of arms; the arms ofFerdinand I in the book on Fortification; those of Michel Behaim, ofwhich the block is extant with a letter written by Drer on the back;the arms of Roggendorf, mentioned in the Netherlands _Journal_, ofwhich only one impression is known, and the arms of Lorenz Staiber, ofwhich the original version is also unique. There can be no doubt thatthe Ebner book-plate of 1516 is by Drer; the much earlier Pirkheimerbook-plate is intimately connected with the illustrations to the booksby Celtes, and cannot be regarded as a certain work of the masterhimself, while the arms of Johann Tschertte are also doubted.It is a fortunate circumstance for the museums and collectors ofto-day that Drers prints have always been esteemed, and his monogramwas held in such respect and so generally recognized as the mark ofsomething good that they have been preserved during four centuries,while so much that was interesting was allowed to perish because it wasunsigned or its signature was not recognized as the work of any oneimportant. It may be paradoxical to say that Drers are common; few ofthem are to be had at any particular moment when one wants to get them;but they are commoner than any other prints of their period, and alarge number of impressions of some subjects must come into the marketin the course of every ten years. But the sort of Drer the collectorwants, the really beautiful, fresh, clean impression, with the rightwatermark and genuine, unbroken border-line, is not, and never hasbeen, common. It is surprising how few, even of the famous museums ofEurope, have a really fine collection of the woodcuts, perhaps becauseso many of them were formed some generations ago in uncritical times,when people were apt to think it enough if the subject was represented,in whatever condition it might be. The first-rate proofs are scarce,and getting scarcer every year; when they are to be had, they should begrasped and treasured.SOME EARLY ITALIAN ENGRAVERS BEFORE THE TIME OF MARCANTONIOBY ARTHUR M. HINDOf the Department of Prints and Drawings, British MuseumAuthor of Catalogue of Early Italian Engravings in the BritishMuseum, Short History of Engraving and Etching, RembrandtsEtchings: an Essay and a Catalogue, etc.Fifteenth-century Italian engraving is not an easy hunting-ground forthe collector, but it is one of the most fascinating not less for itsown sake than for the difficulty of securing ones prize.From the time of Raphael onward Italian engraving presents anoverwhelmingly large proportion of reproductions of pictures, and loseson that account its primary interest. But in the fifteenth and theearly sixteenth century, the engravers, though for the most part lessaccomplished craftsmen, were artists of real independence. We may insome cases exaggerate this independence through not knowing the sourceswhich they used, but the mere lack of that knowledge adds a particularinterest to their prints. Treated not only in virtue of their specialclaim as engravings, but merely as designs, we find something in themwhich the paintings of the period do not offer us.In general, the presence and influence of one of the greater artisticpersonalities of the time may be recognized, but seldom definitelyenough for us to trace the painters immediate direction. Mantegna isthe most brilliant exception of a painter of first rank who is knownto have handled the graver at this period. But forgetting the greatnames it is remarkable how in the early Renaissance in Italy even thesecondary craftsmen produced work of the same inexpressible charm thatpervades the great masterpieces.One of the most beautiful examples I can cite is the _Triumph ofBacchus and Ariadne_, which is known only in the British Museumimpression. It has all the fascination of Botticellis style withoutbeing quite Botticelli--unless the engraver himself is to account forthe coarsening in the drawing of individual forms. Mr. Herbert P.Horne, the great authority on Botticelli and his school, thinks itis by Bartolommeo di Giovanni (Berensons Alunno di Domenico). Butwhether immediately after Botticelli or after some minor artist of theschool, there is the same delightful flow and rhythmic motion in thedesign that one thinks of in relation to Botticellis _Spring_.[Illustration: TRIUMPH OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNEAfter a design by a close follower of Botticelli, possibly byBartolommeo di GiovanniBut whether immediately after Botticelli or after some minor artist ofthe school, there is the same delightful flow and rhythmic motion inthe design that one thinks of in relation to Botticellis _Spring_....We could ill afford to lose the charm of the early Florentine _Triumphof Bacchus and Ariadne_ for all the finished beauty of Marcantonios_Lucretia_, and it is still the youth of artistic development, with itsnave joy and freshness of outlook, which holds us with the strongerspell.Arthur M. Hind.Reproduced from the unique impression in the British MuseumSize of the original engraving, 8  22 inches][Illustration: THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGINFlorentine engraving, in the Broad Manner, after a design by BotticelliMost important of all the contemporary engravings after Botticelliis the _Assumption of the Virgin_.... An original study by Botticellifor the figure of St. Thomas, who is receiving the girdle of theVirgin, is in Turin, and clinches the argument in favor of Botticellisauthorship. The view of Rome, a record of Botticellis visit, is aninteresting feature of the landscape. Arthur M. Hind.Size of the original engraving, 32  22 inches]Botticelli was in early life under the immediate inspiration, if notin the very service, of the great goldsmith Pollaiuolo (witness hispicture of _Fortitude_ in Florence). One almost expects in consequencethat he may at some period have tried his hand at engraving, but thereis no proof that he did anything besides supplying the engravers withdesigns. His chief connection with the engravers was in the series ofplates done for Landinos edition of Dantes Divine Comedy (Florence,1481). Altogether nineteen plates (and a repetition of one subject)are known, but although spaces are left throughout the whole editionfor an illustration to each canto, it is only in rare copies that morethan two or three are found. Even the fine presentation copy toLorenzo de Medici (now in the National Library, Florence) is withouta single plate, showing perhaps the small regard that was paid toengraving for book decoration at that period. This lack of appreciationand the difficulties (or double labor) the printers experienced incombining copperplate impressions with type led soon after this anda few other experiments of the period to the use of woodcut as theregular mode of book illustration for well over a century. Apart fromthe plates to this edition, Botticellis devotion to Dante is shown inthe beautiful series of pen drawings--in the most subtly expressiveoutline--preserved at Berlin and in the Vatican. It seems on the wholeprobable that they are later than the 1481 edition, so that we cannotpoint to the original drawings for the prints.Most important of all the contemporary engravings after Botticelliis the _Assumption of the Virgin_, the largest of all the prints ofthe period (printed from two plates, and measuring altogether about82.5  56 cm.). An original study by Botticelli for the figure of St.Thomas, who is receiving the girdle of the Virgin, is in Turin, andclinches the argument in favor of Botticellis authorship. The view ofRome, a record of Botticellis visit, is an interesting feature of thelandscape.This engraving is produced in what has been called the BROAD MANNERin contradistinction to the FINE MANNER, e.g. of the _Dante_ prints.In the BROAD MANNER the lines are laid chiefly in open parallels,and generally the shading is emphasized with a lighter return strokelaid at a small angle between the parallels. Its aim is essentiallythe imitation of pen drawing after the manner of such draughtsmenas Pollaiuolo and Mantegna. The FINE MANNER on the other hand showsshading in close cross-hatching (somewhat patchy and cloudy in effectin most of the early Florentine prints), and gives the appearance ofimitating a wash drawing.The two manners may be well compared in the series of Prophets andSibyls, which exists in two versions, the earlier being in the Fine,and the later in the Broad Manner. The first series shows a craftsmanwho drew largely from German sources (putting a _St. John_ of theMaster E. S. into the habit of the _Libyan Sibyl_). In the second wehave an artist who discarded all the ugly and awkward features whichoriginated in the German originals, and showed throughout a far truerfeeling for beauty and a much finer power of draughtsmanship thanthe earlier engraver. Mr. Herbert Horne suspects, rightly I think,that Botticelli himself directly inspired this transformation of theProphets and Sibyls.Through our lack of knowledge of the engravers of this early periodin Florence we are driven to a rather constant use of the somewhatunattractive distinctions of the Fine and Broad Manners. We mayclaim, however, to have advanced a little further in the elucidationof questions of authorship, though the great German authority onthis period, Dr. Kristeller of Berlin, would still keep practicallyall the early Florentine engravings in an unassailable anonymity.This is of course better than classing all the engravings of theperiod and school, both in the Fine and Broad Manners, under thename of Baccio Baldini, which has long been the custom. A certainBaccio, _orafo_ has been found in documents as buried in 1487,but there is practically nothing to connect his name with thesubstance of our prints. We would not on that account regard him asa myth, but are reduced at the moment to Vasaris statement thatBaldini, the successor of Finiguerra in the Florentine school ofengraving, having little invention, worked chiefly after designs byBotticelli. Considering the fact that both Broad and Fine Manners(in all probability the output of two distinct workshops) show printsdefinitely after Botticelli, we are still in entire darkness as to theposition of Baldini.[Illustration: THE LIBYAN SIBYLFrom a series of the Prophets and Sibyls, engraved in the Fine Mannerof the Finiguerra SchoolSize of the original engraving, 7  4 inches][Illustration: THE LIBYAN SIBYLFrom a series of the Prophets and Sibyls, engraved in the BroadManner of the Finiguerra SchoolSize of the original engraving, 7  4 inches]With regard to an important group of Fine Manner prints, Sir SidneyColvin has given strong reasons for the attribution to Maso Finiguerra,made famous by Vasari as the inventor of the art of engraving.Considering Vasaris evident error in regard to the discovery ofengraving (for there were engravings in the north of Europe well beforethe earliest possible example of Finiguerra), modern students havebeen inclined to regard Finiguerra as much in the light of a myth asBaldini. But there is no lack of evidence as to his life and work, andwithout repeating the arguments here, which are given in full in SirSidney Colvins Florentine Picture-Chronicle (London, 1898), we wouldat least state our conviction that a considerable number of the earlyFlorentine engravings, as well as an important group of nielli, must befrom his hand. Vasari speaks of him as the most famous niello-workerin Florence, and he also speaks of his drawings of figures clothedand unclothed, and histories (the figures evidently the seriestraditionally ascribed to Finiguerra in Florence, but now for a largepart labeled with an extreme of timidity school of Pollaiuolo; thehistories, probably the Picture-Chronicle series, acquired fromMr. Ruskin for the British Museum). Then considering Vasaris fullerstatement that Finiguerra was also responsible for larger engravings inthe light of a group of Florentine engravings which correspond closelyin style with many of the only important group of Florentine nielli(chiefly in the collection of Baron douard de Rothschild, Paris) aswell as with the Uffizi drawings, we can hardly escape the convictionthat Vasari was correct in his main thesis. A curiously entertainingside-light is given by one of these engravings, the _Mercury_ for theseries of Planets. Here we see the representation of a goldsmithsshop in the streets of Florence, stocked just as we know from documentsFiniguerras to have been. And the goldsmith is evidently engaged inengraving, not a niello, but a large copperplate.[Illustration: THE PLANET MERCURYFlorentine engraving in the Fine Manner, attributed to Maso Finiguerra,or his schoolA curiously entertaining side-light is given by one of theseengravings, the _Mercury_ for the series of Planets.

The badge of Medici (the six pallewith three lilies in the uppermost) added by a contemporary hand inpen and ink suggests that this one may have been used by the youngLorenzo himself between about 1465 and 1467, which accords well withthe probable date of the engravings. Arthur M. Hind.(The inscription above reads _ amore te q_ (questa) and _piglia q_:O Love, this to you and Take this.)Size of the original engraving, 4  4 inches]The engravings most certainly by Finiguerra, such as the _JudgmentHall of Pilate_ (Gotha), the _March to Calvary and the Crucifixion_(British Museum), _Various Wild Animals Hunting and Fighting_ (BritishMuseum), are of course rarities which most collectors can never hope topossess. The same may also be said of somewhat later prints in the samemanner of engraving (which may be the work of the heirs of Finiguerrasatelier, which is known to have been carried on by members of hisfamily until 1498), such as the Fine Manner Prophets and Sibyls andthe Otto Prints. We will in consequence devote less space to theserarities, possessed chiefly by a few European collections, than theirartistic interest would justify, keeping our argument henceforwardmore to the engravings that the American amateur has the chance ofseeing or acquiring at home.One of the Otto Prints (so called from the eighteenth-centurycollector who possessed the majority of the series), _A Young Man andWoman Each Holding An Apple_, is in the Gray Collection, Harvard, andit is a charming example of the amatory subjects of the series, printssuch as the Florentine gallant might have pasted on the spice-box tobe presented to his _inamorata_. The badge of Medici (the six pallewith three lilies in the uppermost) added by a contemporary hand inpen and ink suggests that this one may have been used by the youngLorenzo himself between about 1465 and 1467, which accords well withthe probable date of the engravings.The only known engraving by the goldsmith and painter AntonioPollaiuolo, the large _Battle of Naked Men_, shows a far greater artistthan his slightly elder contemporary Finiguerra. They had both studiedin the same workshop and probably continued a sort of partnershipuntil Finiguerras death. Pollaiuolos draughtsmanship evinces a gripand intensity that Finiguerra entirely lacks in his somewhat torpidacademic drawings, and it is seen at its best in this magnificentlyvigorous plate. An excellent impression, surpassed by few in themuseums of Europe, is, I believe, in the collection of Mr. FrancisBullard of Boston.Before leaving Florence for north Italy we would allude to thatattractive engraver of the transition period, Cristofano Robetta. Hisart has lost the finest flavor of the primitive Florentine withouthaving succeeded to the sound technical system of the contemporariesof Drer, but it has a thoroughly individual though delicate vein offancy. The _Adoration of the Magi_, one of his finest plates, is afree translation of a picture by Filippino Lippi in the Uffizi, butthe group of singing angels is an addition of his own, and done witha true sense for graceful composition. Fine early impressions of thisprint are of course difficult to get, but it is perhaps the best knownof Robettas works, because of the number of modern impressions in themarket. The original plate (with the _Allegory of the Power of Love_engraved on the back) belonged to the Vallardi Collection in the earlynineteenth century, and is now in the British Museum, happily safe fromthe reprinter.Among the greatest rarities of early engraving in north Italy isthe well-known series traditionally called the Tarocchi Cards ofMantegna--somewhat erroneously, for they are neither by Mantegna, norTarocchi, nor playing-cards at all. As in the case of the Prophetsand Sibyls, there are two complete series of the same subjects by twodifferent engravers. Each series consists of fifty subjects dividedinto five sections and illustrating: (1) the Sorts and Conditions ofMen; (2) Apollo and the Muses; (3) the Arts and Sciences; (4) the Geniiand Virtues; (5) the Planets and Spheres. A considerable number of theearliest impressions known are still in contemporary fifteenth-centurybinding, and it seems as if the series was intended merely as aninstructive or entertaining picture-book for the young. There is themost absolute divergence of opinion as to which is the original series,and the student is encouraged to whet his critical acumen on theproblem by the excellent set of reproductions which has recently beenissued by the Graphische Gesellschaft and edited by Dr. Kristeller.Unfortunately Dr. Kristeller takes what seems to me an entirely wrongview of the matter. I cannot but feel that the more finely engravedseries is at the same time the more ancient, and almost certainlyFerrarese in origin, so characteristic of Cossa is the type of thesefigures with large heads, rounded forms, and bulging drapery. Thesecond series shows a more graceful sense of composition and spacing(the heads and figures being in better relation to the size of theprint), but its very naturalism is to me an indication of its somewhatlater origin. The less precise technical quality of this second seriesis closely related to the Florentine engravings in the Fine Manner,and I am inclined to regard it as the work of a Florentine engraver ofabout 1475 to 1480, i.e. about a decade later than the original set.[Illustration: ANTONIO POLLAIUOLO. BATTLE OF NAKED MENThe only known engraving by the goldsmith and painter AntonioPollaiuolo, the large _Battle of Naked Men_, shows a far greaterartist than his slightly elder contemporary, Finiguerra. Pollaiuolosdraughtsmanship evinces a grip and intensity that Finiguerra entirelylacks in his somewhat torpid academic drawings, and it is seen at itsbest in this magnificently vigorous plate.

THE ADORATION OF THE MAGICristofano Robettas art has lost the finest flavor of the primitiveFlorentine without having succeeded to the sound technical system ofthe contemporaries of Drer, but it has a thoroughly individual thoughdelicate vein of fancy.

Arthur M. Hind.Size of the original engraving, 11  11 inches]Leaving the pseudo-Mantegna for the master himself, we are inthe presence of the greatest of the Italian engravers beforeMarcantonio--if not of all time. Like the Florentines, Mantegna was anardent lover of antiquity, but his spirit was far more impassive, farmore like the antique marble itself. His classical frame of mind was tosome extent the offspring of his education in the school of Squarcioneand in the academic atmosphere of Padua. His art has a monumentaldignity which the Florentines never possessed, but it was without thefreshness and inexpressible charm that pervade Tuscan art. An engravinglike the _Risen Christ between St. Andrew and St. Longinus_ is anindication of the genius that might have made one of the noblestsculptors, and one regrets that he never carried to accomplishment theproject of a monument to Vergil in Mantua, which Isabella dEste wishedhim to undertake.Seven of the engravings attributed to Mantegna (including the _RisenChrist_) are so much above the rest in subtle expressiveness, as wellas in technical quality, that we cannot but agree with Dr. Kristellersconclusion that these alone are by Mantegnas hand, and the restengraved after his drawings. They are similar to Pollaiuolos _Battleof Naked Men_ in style, engraved chiefly in open parallel lines ofshading with a much more lightly engraved return stroke between theparallels. It is this light return stroke, exactly in the manner ofMantegnas pen drawing, which gives the wonderfully soft quality tothe early impressions. But it is so delicate that comparatively fewprintings must have worn it down, and the majority of impressions thatcome into the market show little but the outline and the stronger linesof shading. Even so these Mantegna prints do not lose the splendidlyvigorous character of their design, but it is of course the fine earlyimpressions which are the joy and allure of the true connoisseur. Theseven certainly authentic Mantegna engravings are the _Virgin andChild_, the two _Bacchanals_, the two _Battles of the Sea-Gods_, thehorizontal _Entombment_, and the _Risen Christ_, already mentioned.[Illustration: ANDREA MANTEGNA. THE RISEN CHRIST BETWEEN ST. ANDREW ANDST. LONGINUSOf all the early Italian engravers, Andrea Mantegna is by far the mostpowerful, though scarcely the most human. Like many of the Florentines,he was an ardent lover of antiquity, but his spirit was far moreimpassive than theirs, and far more like the antique marble itself. Hisart has a monumental dignity which the Florentines never possessed, butit lacks the freshness and inexpressible charm that pervade Tuscan art.His was a genius that would have made one of the noblest sculptors: theengraving of the _Risen Christ_ shows what he might have achieved inthe field. Arthur M. Hind.Size of the original engraving, 15  12 inches][Illustration: ZOAN ANDREA(?). FOUR WOMEN DANCINGThis engraving, based on a study by Mantegna for a group in the Louvrepicture of _Parnassus_, is one of the most beautiful prints of theschool of Mantegna. It is most probably by Zoan Andrea.Size of the original engraving, 8  13 inches]Nearest in quality to these comes the _Triumph of Caesar: theElephants_, after some study for the series of cartoons now preservedat Hampton Court. But it lacks Mantegnas distinction in drawing, andZoan Andrea, who is probably the author of one of the anonymousengravings of _Four Women Dancing_ (based on a study for a group in theLouvre picture of _Parnassus_), one of the most beautiful prints ofthe school, was certainly capable of this achievement. Even GiovanniAntonio da Brescia, who did work of a very third-rate order aftermigrating to Rome, produced under Mantegnas inspiration so excellent aplate as the _Holy Family_.Other prints attributed to Mantegna, such as the _Descent into Hell_and the _Scourging of Christ_, possess all Mantegnas vigor of design,and reflect the masters work in the manner of the Eremitani frescos,but we can hardly believe that they were engraved by the same handas the seven, even supposing a considerably earlier date for theirproduction.Each of Mantegnas known followers (Zoan Andrea and G. A. da Brescia)entirely changed his manner of engraving after leaving the master; infact, except in his immediate entourage, Mantegnas style was continuedby few of the Italian engravers. For all its dignified simplicity,it is more the manner of the draughtsman transferred to copper, thanof the engraver brought up in the conventional use of the burin. Wesee Mantegnas open linear style reflected in the earlier works ofNicoletto da Modena, and the Vicentine, Benedetto Montagna, but each ofthese engravers tended more and more in their later works to imitatethe more professional style of the German engravers, and of Drer inparticular. Drer was constantly copied by the Italian engravers of theearly sixteenth century, and details from his plates (chiefly in thelandscape background) were even more consistently plagiarized.In the example of Nicoletto da Modena, the _Adoration of theShepherds_, which we reproduce, it is Drers immediate predecessor,Martin Schongauer, from whom the chief elements in the subject arecopied. But in this example the background, with its vista of lake withships and a town, suggested no doubt by one of the subalpine Italianlakes, is thoroughly characteristic of the South, while SchongauersGothic architecture is embellished with classical details. Isolatedfigures of saints or heathen deities against a piece of classicalarchitecture, set in an open landscape, became the most frequenttype of Nicolettos later prints, which are practically all of smalldimensions.Like Nicoletto da Modena, Benedetto Montagna gradually developedthroughout his life a more delicate style of engraving, entirelygiving up the large dimensions and broad style of his _Sacrifice ofAbraham_ for a series of finished compositions which from their smallercompass would have been well adapted for book illustration. Several ofthese, such as the _Apollo and Pan_, illustrate incidents in OvidsMetamorphoses, but there is no evidence for, and there is evenprobability against, their having ever been used in books. Several ofthe subjects are treated very similarly in the woodcuts of the 1497Venice edition of Ovid in the vernacular. When engravings and woodcutsthus repeat each other, the woodcutter is generally the copyist, but inthis case the reverse is almost certainly the case, as the Ovid platesbelong to Montagnas later period, and could hardly have preceded 1500.[Illustration: NICOLETTO DA MODENA. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDSIn the _Adoration of the Shepherds_ it is Drers immediatepredecessor. Martin Schongauer, from whom the chief elements in thesubject are copied.

APOLLO AND DIANAJacopo de Barbari is of peculiar interest as a link between thestyles of Germany and the South. Whether of Northern extraction or notis uncertain, but the earlier part of his life was passed in Venice.Drer was apparently much impressed by his art on his first visit toVenice between 1495 and 1497, and ... even seems to have taken animmediate suggestion for a composition from Barbari, i.e. for his_Apollo and Diana_. Drers version shows a far greater virility andconcentration of design, but for all its power it lacks the breezieratmosphere of Barbaris print. Arthur M. Hind.Size of the original engraving, 6  3 inches]Apart from Mantegna, Leonardo and Bramante are the two great nameswhich have been connected with engravings of the period. But I inclineto doubt whether either of them engraved the plates which have beenattributed to them. The large _Interior of a Ruined Church_, splendidin design and reminiscent of the architects work in the sacristy of S.Satiro, Milan, might equally well have been engraved by a Nicoletto daModena, with whose earlier style it has much in common. Of the printsattributed to Leonardo, the fascinating _Profile Bust of a Young Woman_(p. 252), unique impression in the British Museum, stands out from therest for the sensitive quality of its outline, but even here I would bemore ready to see the hand of an engraver like Zoan Andrea, who afterleaving Mantua seems to have settled in Milan and done work in a finermanner influenced by the style of the Milanese miniaturists (such asthe Master of the Sforza Book of Hours in the British Museum).In Venice Giovanni Bellinis style is reflected in the dignifiedengravings of Girolamo Mocetto, and in the region of Bologna or Modenaone meets the anonymous master I B (with the Bird), whose fewengraved idyls are among the most alluring prints of the lesser mastersof north Italy.More individual than Mocetto and far less dependent on any othercontemporary painter is Jacopo de Barbari, who is of peculiar interestas a link between the styles of Germany and the South. Whether ofNorthern extraction or not is uncertain, but the earlier part of hislife was passed in Venice. Drer was apparently much impressed byhis art on his first visit to Venice between 1495 and 1497, and hisparticular interest in the study of a Canon of Human Proportions wasaroused by some figure-drawings which Barbari had shown him. Drer evenseems to have taken an immediate suggestion for a composition fromBarbari, i.e. for his _Apollo and Diana_. Drers version shows a fargreater virility and concentration of design, but for all its power itlacks the breezier atmosphere of Barbaris print; it is redolent of thestudy, while the latter has the charm of an open Italian landscape.There is a distinct femininity about Barbari; perhaps this very featureand the languorous grace of his treatment of line and the sinuous foldsof drapery give his prints their special allure.I would close this article with some reference to two other engraversof great individuality of style--Giulio and Domenico Campagnola, ofPadua.Domenicos activity as a painter continued until after 1563, butthe probable period of his line-engravings (about 1517-18), and hisclose connection with Giulio Campagnola (though the exact nature ofthe relationship is unexplained), justify his treatment among theprecursors rather than in the wake of Marcantonio.Giulio Campagnola, like Giorgione, whose style he so well interpreted,was a short-lived genius. He was a young prodigy, famous at the tenderage of thirteen as a scholar of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, besides beingaccomplished as a musician and in the arts of sculpture, miniature, andengraving. Little wonder that he did not long survive his thirtiethyear. Probably his practice as an illuminator as well as his particularaim of rendering the atmosphere of Giorgiones paintings led him tothe method of using dots, or rather short flicks, in his engraving,which is in a sense an anticipation of the stipple process of theeighteenth century, though of course without the use of etching. Mostof his prints are known in the two states--in pure line, and after thedotted work had been added.[Illustration: GIULIO CAMPAGNOLA. ST.

More completely characteristic,and the most purely Giorgionesque of all his prints, is the _Christ andthe Woman of Samaria_, one of the most wonderfully beautiful of all theengravings of this period.It is Giorgione again whom we see reflected in the _Shepherds in aLandscape_, a plate which seems to have been left unfinished by Giulioand completed by Domenico Campagnola. There is a drawing in the Louvrefor the right half of the print, and there is every reason to thinkthat this drawing as well as the engraving of that portion of thelandscape is by Giulio. But the group of figures and trees on the leftis entirely characteristic of the looser technical manner of Domenico.The existence of a copy of the right-hand portion of the plate alonepoints to the existence of an unfinished state of the original, thoughno such impressions have been found. In any case it distinctly supportsthe theory that the other part of the original print was a lateraddition.We may have to admit in conclusion that there is nothing in Italianengraving before Marcantonio quite on a level with the achievement ofAlbrecht Drer, but the indefinable allure that characterizes so muchof the work of the minor Italian artists of the earlier Renaissance ismore than enough compensation for any lack of technical efficiency.With Marcantonio we find this efficiency in its full development,joined to a remarkable individuality in the interpretation of sketchesby Raphael and other painters. Yet we could ill afford to lose thecharm of the early Florentine _Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne_ for allthe finished beauty of Marcantonios _Lucretia_, and it is still theyouth of artistic development, with its nave joy and freshness ofoutlook, which holds us with the stronger spell.A PRINCE OF PRINT-COLLECTORS: MICHEL DE MAROLLES, ABB DE VILLELOIN(1600-1681)BY LOUIS R. METCALFEThe French make a fine distinction between three varieties of that veryspecial individual to whom we refer in a general way as a collector.They have always been authorities on that subject and one of them hassaid: On est amateur par got, connaisseur par ducation, curieuxpar vanit. While another adds: Ou par spculation. By collectorwe simply mean a person who has formed the habit of acquiring thethings in which he is particularly interested, and these in as manyvarieties as possible. It implies neither an artistic pursuit nor adeep knowledge of the subject. By _curieux_, however, is meant, as arule, an _amateur_, a man of taste who collects things which pertainto art exclusively; he is in most cases a _connaisseur_, and always anenthusiast.Paris, the home of taste, has never been that of the _curieux_ moreso than at the present day, when, it seems, every one who can afforda rent of over four thousand francs has a hobby of some sort and isa mad collector. A general history of the weakness for things eitherbeautiful or odd or rare, or merely fashionable, would be bothvoluminous and chaotic, if a distinction were not made between thatwhich pertained to art and that which did not. A complete descriptionof the latter, a hopelessly heterogeneous mass, would make an amusingvolume, for there is no end to the variety of things in which vanityand folly have caused human beings to become interested to the point ofcollecting in large numbers.George IV collected saddles; the Princess Charlotte and many others,shells. Tulips were so madly sought after in Holland that one rootwas exchanged for 460 florins, together with a new carriage, a pairof horses, and a set of harness. Shop-bills and posters have beenthe specialty of many, while thousands of persons have collectedpostage-stamps and coins. A Mr. Morris had so many snuff-boxes that itwas said he never took two pinches of snuff out of the same box. A Mr.Urquhart collected the halters with which criminals had been hanged;and another enthusiast, the masks of their faces. Suett, a comedian,collected wigs, and another specialist owned as many as fifteen hundredskulls, Anglo-Saxon and Roman. If there have been men who have shown apropensity to collect wives, Evelyn tells us in his diary:In 1641 there was a lady in Haarlem who had been married to hertwenty-fifth husband, and, having been left a widow, was prohibitedfrom marrying in future; yet it could not be proved that she had evermade any of her husbands away, though the suspicion had brought herdivers times to trouble.Although we much regret that such an intensely interesting work as aComprehensive History of Collecting has never been written, we realizethat a mere description of rare and beautiful objects would beunsatisfactory as long as we did not know their history and the way inwhich they had been gathered together. It is the soul of the collectorwhich we should like to see laid bare. Was his work a labor of vanityor one of love? Were his possessions mere playthings, speculation, tohim, or did they represent treasures of happiness greater than all thegold in Golconda?Without a doubt, it is one thing to collect what is highly prized onall sides, with large means at ones disposal, and the constant adviceof experts, and quite another to search patiently oneself for thingswhich the general public has not yet discovered, and then to acquirethem with difficulty.Who shall know with what admirable zeal some collectors have madethemselves authorities on the things which they loved? with whatuntiring energy they have sifted for years masses of trash in thehope of finding the hidden pearl? Who can tell the inner history ofthe auction-room, the heart-beats of those who were after the jewelwhich no one else seemed to have noticed, the sacrifices which manywith a slender purse have made in order to secure the precious find,and lastly the enjoyment which they ever afterward derived from itspossession? Many of the great French collections of the last centurywere made in this spirit: they were begun with a modest outlay anddevoted to things which, at that time, no one else wanted. I know ofone of the first collectors of Eastern Art in the nineteenth century,who at one time had greatly to reduce his household in order to satisfyhis passion for Japanese vases; and of another wealthy enthusiast whowould travel third-class to London to secure an old Roman bronze. Thehistory of such collections becomes that of human beings for whom lifeis nothing without beauty, and it is too personal to be recorded. Thecollector will seldom believe that his enthusiasm can be understood byothers besides himself: maybe, also, he would be unwilling to revealthe more or less innocent subterfuges to which he had recourse in orderto acquire more than one of his treasures.The American chapter of such a history is the most recent one, and theworld is now watching its development with bated breath. The art ofthe Old World is being imported by the ship-load; fortunes are paidfor single paintings, while the paneled wainscots of French chteaux,the ceilings of Italian palaces, the colonnades of their gardens,and the tapestries of the Low Countries, not to mention a hundredvarieties of _objets dart_, are constantly wending their way to thetreasure-houses--still in course of construction--of the New World. Allthis is taking place to the indignation of Europeans and the stheteswho consider such a radical change of background a desecration, and donot stop to think that this transplantation is hardly more unnaturalthan the sight of the Elgin marbles in foggy London, or the wingedbulls of Ecbatana in the halls of the Louvre.So long as we as a nation will learn a much-needed lesson and therebygreatly improve our taste, let all honor and glory be given to thosewho have been responsible for such valuable acquisitions. Our Americancollections already contain many gems of purest ray serene, and whowill dare say that they are not destined to become in time worthysuccessors of the famous ones which have preceded them?From the writings of Pliny and other classic historians, and fromseveral catalogues and rare documents which have come down to us fromthe Middle Ages and the Renaissance, we have abundant proof thatthere never was a time when works of art were not treasured. Cicero,Atticus, and Varro collected writings, and the libraries of Aristotle,Theophrastus, and that of Epaphroditus of Chronea, which containedthirty-two thousand manuscripts, were famous. Hannibal was a lover ofbronzes: it was he who owned the little Hercules of Lysippus which themaster himself had presented to Alexander the Great and which afterwardbecame the property of Sulla.Both Pompey and Julius Csar possessed splendid masterpieces of thatGreek art which was so highly prized in Italy. The Venus of theHermitage comes from Csars gallery, and the Jupiter of the Louvrefrom that of Antony; while the Faun with the Child, and the Borghesevase, now treasured in the Louvre, were once among the possessions ofSallust in his palace on the Quirinal. Not only sculpture was collectedin those times, for we also hear of the tapestries of Saurus, valuedat twenty millions in the currency of the day; the jewelry of Verres,reputed the finest in existence; the priceless crystals of Pollio; andthe two thousand vases of precious stone owned by Mithridates, King ofPontus.Throughout the Middle Ages the _trsor_ of the kings and the mostpowerful nobles was in reality their collection. That of Dagobert wasthe result of four Italian conquests. The inventory of the jewels ofthe Duc dAnjou, son of John the Good, contains 796 numbers, whilehis brother, the Duc de Berry, had a passion for reliquaries, oldchurch ornaments, and rare manuscripts which he caused to be mountedlike jewels. The library of Charles V and his _trsor_ were valuedat twenty millions of francs, and the collection of curiosities ofYsabeau de Bavire had not its equal. It contained, among other things,an ivory box in which was kept the cane with which Saint Louis usedto flagellate himself. The Dukes of Burgundy for centuries were thegreatest collectors of richly inlaid armor. And what of the treasuresof Jacques Cur, the great banker of Charles VII? With his fleet oftrading-vessels and his many banking-houses he secured the pick of themarket. We know that his silverware was piled up to the ceiling in thevaults of his palace at Bourges.In the _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ for the year 1869 we read a descriptionof the home of Jacques Duchi, a famous art collector who flourishedduring the first half of the fifteenth century. In the courtyardwere peacocks and a variety of rare birds. In the first room was acollection of paintings and decorated signs; in the second, all kindsof musical instruments--harps, organs, viols, guitars, and psalterions.In the third was a great number of games, cards and chessmen; andin the adjoining chapel, rare missals on elaborately carved stands.In the fourth room the walls were covered with precious stones andsweet-smelling spices, while on those of the next was hung a greatvariety of furs. From these rooms one proceeded to halls filled withrich furniture, carved tables, and decorated armor.[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF MICHAEL DE MAROLLES, ABB DE VILLELOINEngraved by Claude Mellan, from his own design from life, in 1648][Illustration: _Illustrissimi Viri L.

What could havewithstood the influence of that tremendous movement? The art of Italyand the magnificence of the nobility and the princes of the Churchshed, like the Augustan Age, a golden glamour over civilization.The Mdicis set the example, and they were closely followed by theSforzas, the Farneses, and the Gonzagas. The patronage of the Fine Artswas on such a scale, and the rivalry among the collectors so keen, thatin 1515 there were in Rome thirty-nine cardinals who had veritablemuseums for palaces. It was for Agostino Chigi that Raphael decoratedthat Farnesina Villa in which such treasures were stored, and for whom,later, he designed those plates on which parrots tongues were servedto Leo X.What a rage for beauty there was when Baldassarre Castiglione advisedall the sons of noble families to study painting, in order that theymight become better judges of architecture, sculpture, vases, medals,intaglios, and cameos. What a madness for antiques, when Cardinal SanGiorgio sent back to Michelangelo his Amorino because he consideredit too modern. Would that we could follow the vicissitudes throughwhich went the great collections of the day--the drawings of Vasari,the books of Aldus and Pico della Mirandola, the armor of Cellini, theportraits of Paolo Giovio and the medals of Giulio Romano!Certain is it that many of their treasures eventually crossed the Alps.It was after Charles VIII had shown to the lite of his nation theremnants of antiquity gilded by the sun of Naples and of Rome that theFrench Renaissance, already well on its way, received new inspiration,and that the French collectors renewed their activity. Judging by thefabulous accounts given by the country-folk, the contents of manya turreted castle on the Loire must have been wonderful, indeed.Following the lead of Francis I, who had his library, his _pavillondarmes_, and his _cabinet de curiosits_, and the example of Catherinede Mdicis, who had brought from Italy many of her familys treasures,the leading nobles, like Georges dAmboise in his Chteau de Gaillon,collected beautiful things with admirable catholicity. It was not onlybooks in sumptuous bindings which were sought after by Louis XII andthe Valois, Diane de Poitiers, Queen Margot, Amyot, and de Thou, butart in every form. In the case of Grolier himself, are we not toldby Jacques Strada, in his Epithome du Thrsor des Curiositez, thatgreat was the number of objects of gold, silver, and copper in perfectcondition, and remarkable the variety of statues in bronze and marble,which his agents were collecting for him all over the world?Most significant is the inventory of the collection of FlorimondRobertet, the able treasurer of the royal finances under CharlesVIII, Louis XII, and Francis I, which was made in 1532 by Michellede Longjumeau, his widow. Never was a catalogue such a labor of loveas this one. It is a detailed description of the entire contents ofa museum on which a great financier spent his entire fortune; it isfull of significant touches concerning the customs of the time andthe origin and use of the objects described; and it bears witness tothe great enjoyment which both husband and wife derived from theirtreasures throughout their lifetime. There were many jewels and somepear-shaped pearls of great size, silver andirons, thirty sets of silksand tapestries, bronzes and ivories. Among the paintings and sculpturewere a canvas and a statue by Michelangelo. The porcelain was the firstbrought to France from China, and there was much pottery from Turkishlands and Flanders, French faence, Italian majolica, church ornaments,precious books, and four hundred pieces of Venetian glass, gentillisezdes plus jolies gayetez que les verriers sauraient inventer.It was the religious wars of the end of the century which broughtFrench collecting to a stop. Constant strife and persecutiondiscouraged the last artists of the Renaissance, ruined many a noblefamily, and scattered the contents of their palaces. Not until yearsafterward, during the seventeenth century, was it taken up again; thenit was to reach great brilliancy during the reign of Louis XIV. Theleading families of France began to rebuild their collections whenHenry IV and his favorite, Gabrielle dEstres, indulged their fondnessfor medals, cameos, and intaglios, and Marie de Mdicis had broughtfrom Tuscany those paintings which she considered such an indispensableluxury. In after years Louis XIII collected armor; Anne of Austria,delicate bindings; and Richelieu, finely chased silverware. And whenLouis XIV began to reign, Paris was the proud center of the collectingworld. From this time on we have full records of the treasures amassedby many people of taste and culture and we are able to follow them intothe following century, no matter how often they change hands--this,thanks to specialists like Felibien and Germain Brice and thethousand references to art in the memoirs of the time. In 1673 therewere in Paris eighty-five important art collectors who owned amongthem seventy-three libraries, and twenty years later this number hadincreased to one hundred and thirty-four, a remarkable development forsuch a short space of time.The greatest example was set by Cardinal Mazarin and Fabri du Peiresc.The wily Italian who had succeeded Richelieu gave as much time to hiscollections as to the ship of state, and his fellow-grafter, NicolasFouquet, treasurer of the kingdom, was allowed to make himself themost powerful man in France just as long as he was able to supply hisEminence with the millions he was so constantly in need of for the armyand his gold-threaded tapestries and busts of Roman emperors. Justbefore his death. Mazarin had himself carried through a gallery linedwith 400 marbles, nearly 500 canvases (among them seven Raphaels), and50,000 volumes, while he kept weeping and exclaiming: Faudra-t-ilquitter tout cela? In the south of France, Fabri du Peiresc, greatsavant and collector, had agents in constant quest of rarities. It isrelated that no ship entered a port in France without bringing forhis collections some rare example of the fauna and flora of a distantcountry, some antique marble, a Coptic, Arab, Chinese, Greek, or Hebrewmanuscript, or some fragment excavated from Asia or Greece.[Illustration: NANTEUIL.

To the masterpieces of Drer, Lucas van Leyden, andMarcantonio, now over a century old, had succeeded the spiritedetchings of Callot. It was he who first popularized the art inFrance and paved the way for the enthusiastic appreciation of Morin,Mellan, and Nanteuil. The school of engravers established by Colbertat the Gobelins made their art rank in importance with Painting andSculpture, and their work won such popular favor that many engraversbecame publishers, and did a great business selling their prints andthose of their pupils to the leading collectors. The first man of tasteto make a serious collection of engravings was Claude Maugis, Abbde Saint Ambroise, almoner to the Queen, Marie de Mdicis. He spentforty years making a collection which at his death was sold to CharlesDelorme, that physician-in-ordinary to Henry IV and Louis XIII of whomCallot has made such an interesting little portrait. It was when thefirst part of the Delorme Collection and that of a Sieur de Kervel hadbeen added to his own possessions by the Abb de Marolles that therewas begun the greatest collection of prints and drawings ever assembled.Michel de Marolles, Abb de Villeloin, was one of the most picturesquefigures of the seventeenth century. He was born in Touraine in 1600,and died in 1681, the son of the gallant Claude de Marolles, _marchalde camp_ in the army of Louis XIII, who had won a famous duel foughtin the presence of two armies in the War of the Ligue. His life wasindeed a peaceful one. At the age of twenty-six, after having pursueda complete course of studies, he was presented by Richelieu with theabbey of Villeloin in Touraine, and for the remainder of his days hedrew its income, cultivated the most interesting people in France,translated the classics, wrote his memoirs, and collected prints as noone ever did before him, or after. Truly, an ideal existence!Although he tells us that at the age of nine he decorated the walls ofhis bedroom with prints given him by a Carthusian monk, we know thatfor the first half of his life the Abb de Villeloin did little morethan collect friends. This must have given him little trouble, for hisrank gained him admission to the entire nobility, and his appreciationof literature and the fine arts enabled him to carry on a friendlyintercourse with the best-known artists and _connoisseurs_. Duringthis intercourse there was a constant exchange of gifts; in fact, toreceive presents seemed to have been the Abbs object in life. In hisMemoirs there are one hundred and fifty pages devoted to a completeenumeration of all the persons who have presented him with a gift, orhonored him extraordinarily by their civility, and the list includesthe best-known personages of the day.What did de Marolles give them in return, besides the pleasure of hiscompany and the charm of his appreciation? A mass of bad translationsof the classics: that was the great weakness of the Abb de Villeloin.Chapelain, the poet, complained of it in a curious letter to Heinsius,saying:That fellow has vowed to translate all the classic authors, and hasalmost reached the end of his labors, having spared neither Plautusnor Lucretius nor Horace nor Virgil nor Juvenal nor Martial, nor manyothers. Your Ovid and Seneca have as yet fought him off, but I donot consider them saved, and all the mercy they can expect is thatof the Cyclops to Ulysses--to be devoured last. That Chapelain wasnot the only one who did not appreciate the literary talent of theAbb, and that he often found difficulty in finding publishers for histranslations, is admitted by de Marolles himself when, in his poem onThe City of Paris, he says:  Jai perdu des amis par un rare caprice  Quand je leur ai donn des livres que jai faits  Comme gens offenss, sans pardonner jamais  Bien quon nait point bless leur mchant artifice.But it is not as a man of letters that de Marolles interests us: it isas a great lover of the art of Engraving and the greatest collector ofprints in history. Not until he had reached the age of forty-four didhe begin to collect them systematically. Then he purchased the firstpart of the Delorme Collection for one thousand _louis dor_, theprints owned by Kervel, and those of several other small collectors.His activity was so great that nine years later, in his memoirs, he wasable to refer to this collection as follows:God has given me grace to devote myself to pictures withoutsuperstition, and I have been able to acquire a collection numberingmore than 70,000 engravings of all subjects. I began it in 1644, andhave continued it with so much zeal, and with such an expense for onenot wealthy, that I can claim to possess some of the work of all theknown masters, painters as well as engravers, who number more than 400.He further adds:I have found that collecting such things was more suited to my pursethan collecting paintings, and more serviceable to the building up of alibrary. Had we in France a dozen such collectors among the nobility,there would not be enough prints to satisfy them all, and the worksof Drer, Lucas, and Marcantonio, for which we now pay four and fivehundred _cus_ when in perfect condition, would be worth three timesthat amount.... It seems to me that princes and noblemen who arecollecting libraries should not neglect works of this kind, as longas they contain so much information on beautiful subjects; but I knowof no one who has undertaken to do this except for medals, flowers,architecture, machines, and mathematics.The collection of the Abb de Marolles had become so famous by 1666,that Colbert, after having had it examined and appraised by Felibienand Pierre Mignard, advised Louis XIV to purchase it for the royallibrary. The deed was signed in 1667, and in the following yearthe Abb de Villeloin received from the royal treasury the sum oftwenty-six thousand livres ($25,000) for what was described in aseal-colored document as un grand nombre destampes des plus grandsmatres de lantiquit. Let us see what this meant.De Marolles tells us himself, in his catalogue of 1666, that hiscollection consisted of 123,400 original drawings and prints, thework of over 6000 artists, and that it was contained in 400 largeand 141 small volumes. As to the variety of subjects represented, ithad no end: it included, for instance, landscapes, views of cities,architecture, fountains, vases, statues, flowers, gardens, jewelry,lacework, machines, grotesques, animals, costumes, decoration, anatomy,dances, comedies, jousts, heraldry, games, heroic fables, religioussubjects, massacres, tortures, and over 10,000 portraits.In describing his collection to Colbert, the Abb made especial note ofhis greatest treasures as follows:_Leonardo da Vinci._ His work is in 5 pieces._Anthony van Dyck._ There are 210 plates after his work, of which 14are etched by his own hand._Marcantonio_ from Bologna, that excellent engraver who has done suchbeautiful work after Drer, Mantegna, Raphael, and Michelangelo, is thegreatest of all engravers, and the one whose works are the most soughtafter. I own 570 of them, in two volumes._Andrea and Benedetto Mantegna._ The work of the former is in 104pieces, that of the latter in 74, all rare, making 178 pieces in all,some of which are engraved by Marcantonio._Lucas van Leyden_, excellent painter and engraver, of whom I havecollected in one volume all the works engraved both on copper and onwood, besides 25 drawings in pen and pencil from his own hand, allvery singular. I have 180 of these engravings, many in duplicate, allof great beauty, among them the portrait of Eulenspiegel, unique inFrance, the other having been sold more than twelve years ago for 16_louis dor_. Among the woodcuts, the Kings of Israel are here done inchiaroscuro, and unique in this state._Albert Drer._ One folio volume, bound in vellum, contains 12portraits of the artist by various masters; 15 drawings by his ownhand, which are singular and priceless; his three plates on brass[_sic_], his six etched plates, and all his copper engravings induplicate, with three impressions of Maximilians sword-hilt, allhaving been collected by the Abb de Saint Ambroise, almoner of QueenMarie de Mdicis...._Rhinbrand_ [_sic_]. The work of this Dutch painter and etcherconsists of many prints, of which I have collected 224, among which areportraits and fancy subjects most curious.He further adds that he possesses 192 original crayon portraits byLagneau, a successor of the Clouets, and 50 by Dumonstier, and that theprints of the old masters of Italy, Germany, and Flanders are containedin 19 folio volumes.After this enormous collection had passed into the hands of the King,the Abb de Marolles was engaged to catalogue and classify it, and alsoto superintend the binding of its 541 volumes. For this he received ontwo occasions a payment of 1200 livres. The binding was done in fulllevant morocco, decorated with the royal arms, Louiss monogram, andrichly tooled borders; for this purpose 500 green and 1200 crimsonskins had been specially imported from the East.Our indefatigable collector had hardly parted with the result of thelabor of twenty-two years when he began the formation of a secondcollection. To the second part of the Delorme Collection which he thenpurchased were added the prints of MM. Odespunck and la Reynie, thecollection of M. Petau, who had made a specialty of portraits, and thatof the Sieur de la Noue, which contained a great number of originaldrawings. We know very little about this second collection of theAbb de Marolles, except that when it was catalogued in 1672 it wascontained in 237 folios. What became of it has never been ascertained;in all probability it found its way into the print-cabinets of the many_amateurs_ of the end of the century. It is evident that he wished todispose of it, probably for the purpose of starting a third collection,for we have a letter on the subject addressed to M. Brisacier,_secrtaire des commandements de la Reine_, of whom Masson made thatfamous engraved plate known as The Gray-haired Man. In it de Marollesdescribes his second collection as being hardly less important thanthe one he had previously sold to the King, and as containing a greatnumber of masterpieces which were unique.Not satisfied with such extensive researches in the realm of art,the Abb de Villeloin decided to record all his information on thesubject, and in the spring of 1666 announced the title of a colossalwork on which he was engaged as: Une histoire trs ample des peintres,sculpteurs, graveurs, architectes, ingenieurs, matres-crivains,orfvres, menuisiers, brodeurs, jardiniers et autres artisansindustrieux, o il est fait mention de plus de dix mille personnes,aussi bien que dun trs grand nombre douvrages considrables, avecune description exacte et nave des plus belles estampes ou de cellesqui peuvent servir  donner beaucoup de connaissances qui seraientignores sans cela. This work was, unfortunately, never published, andits manuscript has never been found; it would have been a wonderfulcompendium of French art during the seventeenth century, and would havegiven us much precious information concerning a number of prominentengravers of whom so little is known to-day.All that remains of it is the summary, written in bad verse andpublished under the title of Le livre des peintres et des graveurs.It is a curious little book, containing little more than the names ofthousands of artists who were obscure in their day and who are nowcompletely forgotten. To many of them, however, and particularly tothe most prominent, are affixed such descriptive little touches, thatwhat would otherwise have been a monotonous pattern becomes an originalpiece of historical ornament.As to the Memoirs of the Abb de Marolles, they possess the samedefect as many other autobiographies of the time: they were publishedtoo soon, and they prove how anxious the author was to witness thesensation he thought he would make. In this case they were publishedin 1653, fourteen years before the Abb had sold his first collection,and they tell us little more than that he possessed a very extendedcircle of acquaintances who thought the world of him on account ofhis patronage of the fine arts and his literary talent. It is evidentthat he included himself among his most sincere admirers, and that heregarded the friendship of such a charming woman as Louise-Marie deGonzague, who later became Queen of Poland, and the incense which allthe engravers in France ostentatiously scattered before him, as bothnatural and deserved. Claude Mellan, Poilly, and Robert Nanteuil wereon particularly friendly terms with him, each in turn engraving hisportrait from life, the last with such delicacy and finish that thatplate ranks among his most successful portraits. Mellan, furthermore,engraved the portraits of his parents, Claude de Marolles and AgathaCastiglione.[Illustration: AGATHA CASTIGLIONEWife of Claude de Marolles and mother of Michel de Marolles, Abb deVilleloinEngraved by Claude Mellan from his own designSize of the original engraving, 6  5 inches][Illustration: CLAUDE DE MAROLLESFather of Michel de Marolles, Abb de Villeloin Engraved by ClaudeMellan from his own designSize of the original engraving, 9  7 inches]The tastes and the mania for collecting of the Abb de Villeloin wereso well known that it is not impossible that it was he of whom LaBruyre was thinking when, in his famous Caractres, he gives thefollowing description of a collector:You wish to see my prints, says Democenes, and he forthwith bringsthem out and sets them before you. You see one which is neither darknor clear nor completely drawn, and better fit to decorate on a holidaythe walls of the Petit Pont or the Rue Neuve than to be treasured in afamous collection. He admits that it is engraved badly and drawn worse,but hastens to inform you that it is the work of an Italian artist whoproduced very little, and that the plate had hardly any printing; that,moreover, it is the only one of its kind in France; that he paid muchfor it, and would not exchange it for something far better. I am,he adds, in such a serious trouble that it will prevent any furthercollecting. I have all of Callot but one print, which is not only notone of his best plates, but actually one of his worst; nevertheless, itwould complete my Callot. I have been looking for it for twenty years,and, despairing of success, I find life very hard, indeed.This is admirably descriptive of a born collector; and what would havebeen a ridiculous mania in a philistine became a natural attitudeon the part of such a _connaisseur_ as the Abb de Marolles. In oureyes his weaknesses were insignificant, and we forgive him his badtranslations, his unpublished history of Art, and the rather monotonousself-sufficiency of his Memoirs, for the encouragement which hishonest enthusiasm and indomitable collecting gave to the artistswho made the Golden Age of Engraving--for having been the Prince ofPrint-collectors.JEAN MORIN1600-1666BY LOUIS R. METCALFEThe Exhibitions of French Engraved Portraits of the Seventeenth Centuryrecently made at the New York Public Library and at the Boston Museumof Fine Arts, give one an excellent idea of the vogue of the portraitand the excellence attained by that remarkable school of engraverswhich flourished under the auspices of Louis XIV. A score of mastersare represented, from Michael Lasne to the superb Nanteuil, and theirmodels, the most representative personages of that grand century ofFrench history, whether plotters against Henry IV, friends and foes ofRichelieu or flatterers of Louis XIV, stand proudly on parade for thetwentieth-century American, in all their glory of immense wigs, armorand lace collars, or in the quieter garb of prelates and counselors tothe king. It is a remarkable illustration to the history of a greatperiod. The nobility represented the survival of the fittest, for inthe early part of the century four thousand of them had died in thosestreet duels which Richelieu had abolished only with the help of theexecutioner. As to the clergy, no wonder that so many of those portlyprelates could afford to have their portraits painted and engraved:the wealth of the church had never been greater. Their example wasfollowed by every one of any importance in the public eye; he had hisportrait made with no more hesitation than one has nowadays to sit to aphotographer of recognized excellence.It was the Golden Age of Portrait-painting, for they were the days ofRubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and that host of splendid Dutch artistsfor whom physiognomy had no secrets. They in turn inspired Philippe deChampaigne and, later, Lebrun and Mignard, Rigaud and Largillire. Manyof their glorious canvases have long been public property and remainto-day enshrined in national museums, but many more have for yearsremained jealously guarded heirlooms in private collections, and havebeen known only to a few. Many of those which have not been destroyedhave become so altered by time and damaged by faulty restoration thatthey hardly do justice to their creators.Thanks to the engraver, these portraits are just as alive to-day aswhen they were painted, for in an engraving there is no paint tofade or darken, no values to become altered. A brilliant impressionof an early state remains to-day what it was when it emerged fromthe masters hand two and a half centuries ago. Such collections asare now exhibited represent more than brilliant examples of an artwhich is lost; they are historical and artistic documents of greatimportance, and the French Engravers of the Seventeenth Century deserveinfinite praise for having showed all the possibilities of an artwhich, as Longhi claims in his book _La Calcografia_, publishes andimmortalizes the portraits of eminent men for the example of presentand future generations, better than any other serving as the vehiclefor the most extended and remote propagation of deserved celebrity.Among the many artists who were responsible for the Golden Age ofEngraving, Jean Morin occupies a unique position. He was born in1600 and died in 1666. Morin has the distinction of having not onlyimmediately preceded and influenced the master of them all, Nanteuil,but also of having produced fifty portraits which, in contradistinctionto all other reproductive engravers, he etched instead of engravedwith the burin. It is difficult, however, to realize what a strikinglyoriginal and personal artist he was, without first considering in whatstage of development his first efforts had found the art.When had engraved portraiture begun in France? We must look for itsfirst steps in the illustrations of the books which were publishedduring the second half of the sixteenth century; they teem withcarefully executed small-sized portraits which, as a rule, were framedin decorative cartouches and bore lengthy inscriptions. Very few ofthem have been drawn from life; the first engravers, not trustingtheir own powers, were content to copy those exquisitely sensitiveand delicate drawings, the crayon portraits which the Clouets made ofroyalty and the court at the time of Francis I, Henry II, and Catherinede Medicis. They are a wonderful pendant to Holbeins drawings of thecourtiers of Henry VIII. The finest are now hanging in the famousGallery of Psyche at Chantilly. Nothing can describe the subtlety withwhich the artist has combined refinement and realism and drawn withdelicate color the features of the famous personages of those tragictimes.[Illustration: MORIN. LOUIS XIII, KING OF FRANCEAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches][Illustration: MORIN. ANNE OF AUSTRIA, REGENT OF FRANCEWidow of Louis XIII and Mother of Louis XIVAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches]Here is Henry IV as a careless youth next to the terrible Catherinewhen she was an innocent-looking young bride; further on are thebaby daughter of Francis I and the indomitable head of the house ofGuise. The sad Charles IX is represented here as a mere boy; there,a week before his death, shaking with fever and tortured by remorsefor the fearful massacre which he had instigated. The ill-fated MaryStuart wears becomingly her widows mourning, and is surrounded by thechivalry and the beauty of the court. The success of these drawings wasso great that every one desired complete sets of them, and the resultwas that they were copied over and over again, first by other artists,and finally by amateurs who were not very faithful to their models.The work of the Clouets was intelligently continued by several membersof the family of Dumonstier, and the vogue of this exquisite form ofportraiture lasted until the middle of the following century.It was these finished miniatures which the first engravers attemptedto reproduce on wood and copper; their drawing was in most cases weak,and consequently the resemblance was seldom faithful; their knowledgeof line-work was very meager, and therefore the modeling was mostprimitive; but in spite of this, their work is interesting for itsexquisite finish and its consistent effort to express the characterof the individual. Such very personal little portraits as those ofPhilibert Delorme in his treatise on architecture, Orlando di Lasso ina book of motets, and the great Ambroise Par in his treatise on thefractures of the skull, shared the fame of those of Henry IV by Thomasde Leu, and greatly increased the popularity of engraving.By the beginning of the seventeenth century it had become extremelyfashionable to dabble in engraving, and painters, architects,goldsmiths, noblemen and even ladies were busy gouging wood and cuttingcopper with an enthusiasm which has bequeathed us a mass of smallillustrations, tail-pieces, grotesques, mottos, emblems and otherembellishments. Then there appeared during the reign of Louis XIII apeculiar genius in Claude Mellan. He adopted such an original techniquethat he had practically no followers. Considering cross-hatching rankheresy, Mellan spent a great part of his life making facsimiles oncopper of more than four score charming pencil-drawings which he hadmade from life, using distinct lines which he made broader in theshadows. Although he thereby succeeded in producing a set of veryremarkable plates, he was prevented by the exaggerated simplicity ofhis system from securing all the detail, the refinement of expressionnecessary to a real psychological study, and he was unable to expressany color, texture or chiaroscuro whatever.The most original artistic genius at that time was Callot, who hadintroduced etching in France; he delighted everybody with the facilityand _esprit_ with which he handled the needle, and he produced a greatnumber of plates full of crisply drawn little figures which possessedso much animation that nothing like them had previously been seen. Histwo attempts at portraiture, however, are far from being significant;it may be said that he was not serious enough for such work.By that time portrait-engraving had become extinct in Germany, andit was achieving little of importance in Italy and Spain; in the LowCountries, however, it was producing masterpieces. Even if Rembrandtand Van Dyck had given the world nothing more than their etchedportraits, their fame would live forever. In the former, the worldfound an artist who painted as effectively with the needle as withthe brush, and an etcher who reveled in such powerful and correctchiaroscuro that his portraits were a perfect revelation. The glowinglight with which he illumined his faces and the boldness and freedomof his line-work amazed the engravers of his time, for in comparisonthey had worked only in outline, and those who attempted to imitate himachieved very little success. In the plates of Rembrandt the engravedportrait reaches the last degree of warmth of expression and life.As to Anthony Van Dyck, he had followed the example of Rubens andencouraged the leading engravers of Antwerp to reproduce his portraitson copper. The result was that noble work called his Iconography,which contained over a hundred portraits of the leading painters andart patrons of the time, most brilliantly engraved by Soutman, theBolswerts, Vorstermann and Paul Pontius under the masters jealoussupervision. In directing this work Van Dyck developed such enthusiasmthat he himself etched eighteen portraits from life, in which the facesare modeled with small dots; they are charming drawings which exhibitsuch a wonderful knowledge of physiognomy, and possess so much lifeand color in spite of the simplicity of their treatment, that theyremain masterpieces for all times.Through the genius of Rubens and Van Dyck the art of engraving hadbecome transformed; at last life and color had come into it. No suchbrilliancy in the treatment of flesh and varied texture had beenattained by pure line-work before the appearance of Pontiuss portraitof Rubens, and with the exception of the etchings of Rembrandt, nothingso human had previously been seen as Van Dycks etching of Pontiushimself.But in spite of the best achievements of the Flemish engravers, therewas still an important advance to be made before the copperplate couldgive such a faithful translation of a painting that besides the drawingand the color, it could reproduce all the refinement of detail, all thetexture and chiaroscuro, all the painter-like effect of the canvas.That interval could be bridged only by a born draughtsman who had thesoul of a portrait-painter and by an artist who would devote himselfexclusively to the solution of that one problem. For that final step ofits development, reproductive engraving had to go to France and to theunique Jean Morin.[Illustration: MORIN. CARDINAL RICHELIEUAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches][Illustration: MORIN. PIERRE MAUGIS DES GRANGESMatre-dHtel of Louis XIIIAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches]It is incredible that so little should be known about an artist ofhis prominence, particularly as at that time the best artists wereconstantly _en evidence_ and undertaking distant travels for thesake of their education and in order to gain patrons. We must assumethat Morin lived a very quiet life and cared little for recognition.Who were his first masters remains a mystery; the references whichare made to him in the records of the time point only to the factthat he was always held in high esteem for the excellence of his work,and that everywhere his serious character commanded respect. Twothings are nevertheless certain concerning him. One is that he hadbegun by becoming a well-schooled painter, for his etched work is ofsingularly uniform excellence; the other is that he had been influencedexclusively by the Flemish School. It was the etching of Van Dyck whichtempted him to give up the brush for the graver, and it was his ownpeculiarly calm and conscientious temperament which impelled him tocarry the original technique of that prince of portraiture to the lastdegree of finish.On the other hand, it was from another Flemish artist, Philippe deChampaigne, who had made France his home, that he received inspirationand guidance throughout his life-work. In return for this he devotedhimself to the faithful reproduction of as many of that masterscanvases as he could engrave before his death.Morins work consists of a few figure-subjects and landscapes and fiftyportraits. These are among the finest that were engraved during theseventeenth century, and they have the distinction of illustratingthe reign of Louis XIII and his minister Richelieu. As an historicalgallery they possess as much importance as the portraits made later bythe school of Nanteuil: four of them are after Van Dyck, fourteen arefrom the works of various painters, including Titian, and all the rest,thirty-two in number, reproduce the dignified canvases of Philippe deChampaigne. It was natural for Morin to turn to the Flemish painter,not only because the latter had soon after his arrival become thepainter of the court and the head of the French School, but because hiscalm, precise art was admirably suited to the engravers work.The canvases of Philippe de Champaigne have little of the power ofRubens, or the coloring and supreme elegance of Van Dyck, nor do theypossess the depth and originality of the portraits of Rembrandt, butthey are characterized by an uncommon strength of draughtsmanship andcomposition, and they unfailingly exhibit such profound seriousness,restraint and dignity as few masters can boast of. As in the caseof most of Morins portraits, it is hard to gaze upon them withoutexperiencing that peculiar sensation of familiarity with the humanbeing represented, without being convinced that here is the bare truthjust as an intelligent and thoroughly sincere nature beheld it, withoutfeeling that some of the models soul has passed into the canvas. Itcould not be otherwise with the work of an artist who had toiled soearnestly to follow an ideal, and who himself had been visited byso much affliction. De Champaigne became at the end of his life aJansenist and a devoted Port Royalist--that is, a member of a communityof austere human beings whose lives were so simple and whose thoughtswere so high that they were a perpetual reproach to the selfishclergy of the day and the empty butterflies who crowded the salons ofVersailles.He has never come into his own, principally because he stood in suchclose proximity to more brilliant lights, and also because so many ofhis scattered paintings have become darkened with age. His work as thepainter of Richelieu established such a popularity for the portraitas it had not known before and as it has not known since. To-day, whenhis name is mentioned, one shrugs his shoulders and says: Oh, well,but what was he compared to Rubens, Van Dyck and Rembrandt?, and thensuddenly remembers that it was he who painted Richelieu and that thefull length portrait which hangs in the Salon Carr of the Louvre andthe triple study of the head which is in the National Gallery, London,will always rank with the masterpieces of portrait-painting.Such was the artist to whom Jean Morin went for advice and for whom hedeveloped such intense admiration and devotion. The Flemish paintermust have readily seen how much the engravers temperament had incommon with his own, and immediately understood that his faultlessdrawing and conscientious nature would make of him an admirableinterpreter of his canvases. Certain it is that he lost no time inencouraging him to develop his technique, and that he cheerfully gavehim his portraits to copy. The friendship which ensued continued untildeath, and Morin devoted his life to popularizing the portraits ofPhilippe de Champaigne, later becoming himself affiliated with thenoble sect of Port Royalists.       *       *       *       *       *The peculiar significance of Morins work, aside from the fact that ithas been the principal means of perpetuating the work of a remarkableartist, is that it represents the first effort in the history ofEngraved Portraiture to reproduce a painted portrait with all itsrefinement of drawing and variety of tones. No such trouble hadpreviously been taken fully to represent all the color and chiaroscuroof a picture. In order to accomplish this the engraver had to developa painters technique, and that was something very different from theprecise and methodical line-work of the engravers who had preceded him.The etched work of Callot was mere line-work; Van Dyck supplementedthis with some delicate modeling made with small dots; and Morin,developing this system to the last degree of refinement, bent all hisenergy to the absolutely faithful reproduction of the canvas in everydetail of line and gradation of light. His technique is chiefly etchingcombined with burin work. As a rule, his faces are modeled entirelywith etched dots, and he does this with such delicacy and refinementthat in many cases they have the quality of a fine mezzotint. Onlyin a few of his plates does he use line-work to deepen his shadows,and this is done over the stippling. By means of this system he wasable to express the greatest variety of tones, from the very lightcomplexion of a blond Englishwoman to the dark skin and blue-black hairof a southern Frenchman. The hair he always etched with great care,with a line admirable alike for its precision and freedom; the framealone seems to have been done with the burin. It is, however, in thetreatment of the costume that Morin shows his independence of technicalfinish; he makes little pretense at securing realism in his expressionof texture. Compared to the work of Nanteuil the surface of his armorand his moir silk cassocks and rich lace collars often lack realism,while his backgrounds possess little of that soft gradation whichenhances the beauty of so many later engravings.[Illustration: MORIN. HENRI DE LORRAINE, COMTE DHARCOURTThe Marshal-in-Chief of the Armies of Louis XIIIAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches][Illustration: MORIN. GUIDO, CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIOThe Papal Nuncio to the Court of Louis XIIIAfter the painting by Anthony Van DyckSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches]But it is this very freedom which makes his plates so original andgives them such especial charm. Besides, why should etching partakeof the character of slow and precise burin work? Morins chiefpreoccupation is the rendering of the face and the preservation of allthe character of the original; it is evident that he spares no painsto make his reproduction an absolutely faithful one. As to the rest ofthe picture, he does not consider it necessary to do more than recallthe picturesque effect of the originals ensemble, but if he treats itwith freedom he is careful to make every line serve a definite purpose;he is never careless. It is to his great sympathy and conscientiousnessthat Morin owed his success as a reproductive engraver, and the factthat his plates had a great influence on his contemporaries. Beforehim no such delicate tones and deep velvety blacks had been seen,no engraver had been so consistently correct and expressive in hisdrawing; so much justice had never been done to a painter.The art of Morin was so personal that the efforts of his pupilsAlix, Plattemontagne and Boulanger to follow his technique remainedunsuccessful; he was as inimitable in his brilliant effects ofchiaroscuro as Mellan with his fiendishly clever but exaggeratedsimplicity of line.Nevertheless, the lesson of thorough faithfulness he had given wasnot lost; the seed fell on fertile ground when Robert Nanteuil, atthe outset of his career, studied Morins work closely enough toimitate his technique in such portraits as those of Pierre Dupuis, theroyal librarian, and the poet Gilles Menage. The engraver from Rheimshad doubtless profited by the example of his own master Regnesson,whose work had already shown Morins influence. Those clever littleportraits as well as a few others done in that style show a markedadvance on the previous ones, in which he had followed that of Mellan,and the delicate little dots with which their faces are modeledpaved the way for that system of close, short strokes with which heeventually succeeded in imitating to perfection the peculiar texture ofskin. Nanteuil was to inherit the best in all who had preceded him andto combine all previous systems into one which would carry the art ofEngraved Portraiture to its greatest development; but it was Morin whogave him the most eloquent example and who pointed out to him the lastremaining step to technical perfection.HIS WORKOn looking through a complete collection of Morins portraits oneis immediately impressed by the small number of plates which denotecrude beginnings. As none of them is dated, it is next to impossibleto arrange his works chronologically, all the more so as the engraverperfected his technique and found his manner very early in his career.We find only one portrait which is really unsatisfactory, that of_Louis XI_, copied possibly from an old miniature, and only two whichshow any hardness of tone, the portraits of _Augustin_ and _Christophede Thou_; they are undoubtedly early works, the head of the dreadedhermit of Plessis-les-Tours being probably Morins first effort. Thenwe have that most Gallic of Frenchmen, _Henry IV_, a quaint head drawnwith much character; _Marie de Mdicis_, after Pourbus; and _HenryII_, after Clouet. These last two are most excellent plates, thefirst showing us that intriguing Italian princess shortly after herarrival from Florence, in all the glory of her wonderful complexion andgolden hair; the second recalling the exquisite art of Clouet in thesimplicity and delicacy of the treatment of the face and the superbdetail of the costume.[1] We are then brought face to face with thegreat _Philip II_ of Spain, in one of Morins most serenely elegantplates after Titian, and the portraits of the two great saints of thetime, _Saint Franois de Sales_ and _San Carlo Borromeo_. To the fourportraits after Van Dyck we must give special attention, for theycontain Morins masterpieces, the portrait of _N. Chrystin_, son of theSpanish plenipotentiary at the Peace of Vervins, and that of _CardinalBentivoglio_, the papal nuncio to the court of Louis XIII. Here we haveMorin in his grand manner, transferring all the color of the originalcanvas to his copperplate and interpreting his models with a boldness,a softness, a clearness of purpose and a strength of sympathy whollyadmirable. In awarding the palm, we hesitate between the deep tones,the velvety finish in the head of the somber Spaniard and the subtlemodeling of the beautifully illumined, sensitive Italian face. Eitherof these portraits alone would have established Morins fame.[1] Why such an authority as Robert-Dumesnil should have classed theportrait of Henry IVs queen among the doubtful plates of Morin is amystery. It is clearly the work of that master, and although an earlyplate, it is one of his brilliant ones.The other two plates after Van Dyck represent women, _Margaret Lemon_,beloved of the painter, and the _Countess of Caernarvon_, a remarkablestudy in high lights, and one of Morins most delicate plates.The remainder of the gallery consists of his interpretation ofPhilippe de Champaignes portraits, and the array of celebrities thererepresented is a notable one. What would we know of the features ofthat eccentric monarch, the melancholic _Louis XIII_, if we did notpossess this striking etching of Morin? The father of _le roi soleil_is here posing, ill at ease, and probably wondering what Richelieu isgoing to make him do next. An unsatisfactory human being was he whoseprincipal merit was to have done what few mediocre characters ever do,bow down to the superiority of genius. His queen, _Anne of Austria_,is here shown both in the quiet garb of a widow (a delightfully simpleportrait) and in the more ceremonious court mourning, while his primeminister, _Richelieu_, is represented in a plate than which there isnone more interesting among Morins works. A comparison between thisimpression of the great cardinals character and that recorded in thesuperb engraving by Nanteuil is a most interesting one. In the latterwe see the steersman of the ship of state in all his grandeur of noblepurpose and responsibility, and we feel the immense will-power withwhich, in constant danger of his life, he bore long with his enemies,and then, driven to action, went far, very far and covered everythingwith his scarlet robe. But in Morins interpretation of the canvasof de Champaigne we see quite another side of the great statesman. Itis the Richelieu whom we perceive through some memoirs of the time(and not the least trustworthy ones), and in the literary history ofthe early seventeenth century. It is a man wholly lacking in a senseof humor, possessing plenty of vanity and constantly yearning forrecognition as a literary light and a squire of dames.[Illustration: MORIN. NICOLAS CHRYSTINSon of the Plenipotentiary of King Philip IV of Spain to the Peace ofVervinsAfter the painting by Anthony Van DyckSize of the original engraving, 11 x 9 inches][Illustration: MORIN. ANTOINE VITRPrinter to the King and the ClergyAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 12 x 8 inches]Quite a different portrait is that of his nephew, _Vignerod_, shownhere in three-quarter figure as the Abb de Richelieu, a mostattractive plate, and one of the only two portraits of Morins in whichthe model is shown otherwise than in the usual bust form. The otherone is that of _Vitr_, a famous printer of the time; it is one of thelowest-toned engraved portraits extant, and in its velvety blackness itis a most striking production. A fine impression of it will turn onesthoughts to Rembrandt and show the full extent of Morins originality.The list contains many famous personages: _Mazarin_; _Michel LeTellier_; _Charles de Valois, duc dAngoulme_, son of Charles IX andthe beautiful Marie Touchet; the _Marchal dHarcourt_, the _Cadet la perle_ of the more famous portrait by Masson and the valorous headof the armies of Louis XIII; the charming _Comtesse de Bossu_ and hersecretly married second husband the _Duc de Guise_; the _Marchal deVilleroy_, preceptor of Louis XIV; _Potier de Gesvres_, also a warrior;and the _Chancellor Marillac_, whose brother was executed by Richelieuand who himself became the cardinals victim, though in a less tragicway. All these plates are an admirable interpretation of theirmodels, and show an absolute lack of mannerism. With their brilliantcontrasts of light and shade and the uncommon amount of texturedue to the freedom of the line-work and the rich color of the inkemployed, they have a richness of tone and a decorative effect sharedby few of the portraits made later in the century. Some of them areengraved in a rather high key and show a simply modeled head againsta light background, as in the case of _Brachet de la Milletire_,the savant who was first an intolerant Calvinist and then became amilitant Roman Catholic. In other portraits like that of _Maugis_, the_matre-dhtel_ of the king, the artist seems to have reveled in thedeepest tones of his inky palette, and he renders the olive skin andthe raven hair of this strong-featured individual with a most strikingintensity.Splendid likenesses of prominent ecclesiastical dignitaries are to befound among the portraits which complete this interesting gallery,but one there is which we must pause to contemplate, and it is thefaithfully reproduced portrait of that extraordinary human being, J.Paul de Gondi, better known as the _Cardinal de Retz_. In a masterpieceof draughtsmanship, Morin duplicates the art of de Champaigne inexpressing all the cleverness and daring, the ambition and the senseof humor, of this born gambler, whose genius for intrigue was at thebottom of the war of the Fronde. One can see him, with his yellow,oily face, unkempt and unshaven, limping through the narrow streets ofParis, distributing largesses among a populace which, the followinghour, he would betray to the nobles, and then again champion.As a pendant we have the brilliantly executed head of _Omer Talon,avocat-gnral du Parlement_, the greatest pillar of Frenchjurisprudence and a great man in his day; it is a plate which Rembrandtwould have deigned to look at more than once.[Illustration: MORIN. JEAN-FRANOIS-PAUL DE GONDIThis personage is better known by his later title of Cardinal de RetzAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 11  9 inches][Illustration: MORIN. OMER TALONAdvocate-General of the Parliament of ParisAfter the painting by Philippe de ChampaigneSize of the original engraving, 12  9 inches]Finally the famous Port Royal is here represented in the persons of_Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres_, who raised such a storm in church circlesof that time; _Arnauld dAndilly_, the head of the great familyof that name and the protector of Port Royal; and _Jean Du Verger deHouranne, abb de Saint-Cyran_, its confessor, a man worthy of thefirst centuries of Christianity. They were famous men in their day,and their names were on everybodys lips; their story spells the mostserious chapter of the history of their age, and still they are all butforgotten in comparison with the great personages of the court, andeven their painted portraits are relegated to obscurity.In these masterly prints of Morin, however, they appear to us just asthey looked in their day, with much of their strength and weakness,their aspirations and their secret ambitions. So much animation isthere in their faces that it is no hard matter to feel like the oldmonk in the Spanish monastery who, left alone of all his brothers,said, as he looked on the new pictures by Velasquez, I sometimes think_we_ are the shadows.ROBERT NANTEUIL1630-1678BY LOUIS R. METCALFEIt is a curious fact that in these days of exhaustive researchin everything which concerns the fine arts, Robert Nanteuil, theportrait-engraver of Louis XIV, has remained until so recently bothillustrious and unknown. To be sure, his name has been mentioned in allthe histories of art, and in the text-books of engraving he is dweltupon at some length and given a prominent place among the engraversof his time; but he was never found worthy of any especial study, ofthe least little _brochure_. His name has been familiar only to theconnoisseurs and the print-collectors; to them it has always beensynonymous with the greatest excellence attained by the lost art ofline-engraving.This silence was broken finally in the artists own birthplace. In 1884Mr. Charles Loriquet, curator of the library of the city of Rheims,who had just completed a collection of Nanteuils portraits for thecity museum, addressed the Academy at one of its public sittings andeloquently pleaded with the authorities to erect a monument to him whomhe considered second only to the great Colbert as the most illustriousson of Rheims. His description of the artist and his work created suchenthusiasm that he was later induced to publish it, together with someinteresting documents concerning Nanteuil. The unique little book foundits way into many libraries, private as well as public, and has eversince been unfindable.Many new books on engraving have appeared since that day which havedevoted as much as two or three pages to this brilliant artist without,however, giving his work more than a superficial criticism. It wasnot until Mr. T. H. Thomas published his recent work French PortraitEngravers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries that the artistreceived proper recognition. Nanteuil is here frankly recognized as oneof the most admirable figures in the history of art, and proclaimed notonly prince of portrait-engravers but also a great artist among theportrait-makers of all times. The thirty pages which are devoted to himconstitute the most brilliant and thorough criticism that has ever beenmade of a line-engraver,--they are a splendid analysis of the artiststechnique, his development, his influence on his contemporaries, andthe exalted position which he occupied among them. Without doubt manyreaders of that interesting work will wonder why they never had beforeheard of such an important artist.It was only four years ago that I for one made his acquaintance. WhileI was looking through a large collection of old engraved portraits, onehead in particular arrested my attention; it was drawn with such rareprecision, modeled with such _maestria_, it had such expressive eyesand mouth, that it made all the other portraits seem flat and lifeless.My admiration turned into wonderment when I saw by the signaturethat the artist had drawn it from life as well as engraved it. I hadknown the work of only those showy engravers who, in the time of LouisXV, were content to copy the work of the leading painters of the dayand improve on it if they could. There was no _traduttore traditore_about this expressive portrait; here was something of a very differentorder. The artist was a real portrait-maker, a student of character, aworthy comrade of Holbein, a draughtsman whose ambition it was firstto represent the subject as he really looked, then to make as fine anengraved plate as possible.The text-books on engraving which fell into my hands informed me of therank he had occupied in that famous school of engraving establishedby Louis XIV and of the great number of prominent people he had drawnfrom life. That was enough to whet my curiosity to the limit, formy interest in physiognomy had become a passion, and whenever I hadfound in the galleries of Europe a convincing portrait of a well-knownhistorical personage, my delight had been keen. Holbeins, Van Dycks,Mierevelts and Quentin de Latours had been for years the objects of myenthusiasm; they were living documents, revelations of personalitiessuch as few memoirs provided. When the catalogue of Robert-Dumesnil,the only complete list of Nanteuils portraits, had informed me thatNanteuils models had been in great part the men who had given so muchgreatness to the reign of the most splendid of modern potentates, Ifelt that the collection must constitute an historical document ofno mean interest, if the likenesses of those celebrities were asconvincing as that of the obscure _Louis Hesselin, Prsident de laChambre des Deniers_, which I now owned.But it was not until I had pored over the contents of six huge volumescontaining his complete works, at the Cabinet des Estampes of theBibliothque Nationale, that I realized what a unique achievementhad been that of the engraver from Rheims. He had made, it seems, amultitude of drawings from life of his contemporaries, in pencil,silverpoint, crayons, and pastels, from the King himself down to thehumblest cur of his parish, and had then engraved many of them oncopper, securing thereby so many impressions that although almostall of his original drawings have disappeared, his work has beenperpetuated for all times. (Whoever has said that a multitude ofsheets of paper scattered among the museums of the world constituted amonument more enduring than the pyramids, must have been a collector,for he realized with how much jealousy a treasure can be guarded.)Throughout all this work Nanteuil exhibited such power as a draughtsmanthat his portraits won international fame for their resemblance,and moreover he engraved with such perfection that his work and theinfluence he exerted over the great school formed by Louis XIV mark theGolden Age of Line-engraving.It is therefore in a dual capacity that Nanteuil must be admired, andthis point has not been sufficiently emphasized by his critics. He isan inspiring example of a man who has set out to do only one thing(for he never attempted anything but heads)--but has learned to do itso well that he rises far above his rivals and has made his name asynonym for supreme excellence. To carry the engraved portrait to itsgreatest possible perfection had been his ambition, and he succeededin this, for it is not possible to imagine the burin producing moredecided color, greater fullness of tone, and finer finish than canbe found in a great many portraits by Nanteuil. It can be said thathe used the sharp metal point with the same freedom as a greatpainter uses a brush; his technique was so elastic and susceptible ofmodification that he was enabled to test to the fullest extent thepossibilities of his medium and to determine its limitations.When one is lucky enough to have the wonderful collections of theCabinet des Estampes at his disposal, the next thing to do after havingseen the works of Nanteuil is to examine those of his contemporaries.It becomes perfectly clear which artists have influenced him, and towhat extent; it will also be evident at a glance that he influenced allthe rest. This study, however superficial, will take several days, forthe number of _peintre-graveurs_ encouraged by Louis XIV through theindefatigable Colbert was great, and their work was enormous. Edelinck,who until recently has been better known than Nanteuil, was extremelyprolific, and Pitau, the Poillys, Masson, Lombart, and Van Schuppen,to say nothing of Mellan and Morin among many others, produced a greatmany portraits. What a collection! What a complete iconography of _legrand sicle_! Here is everybody who was at all prominent in the mostcivilized country of the time. Is it possible not to develop a love ofportraiture, a strong interest in engraving and a desire to collectengraved portraits, of all pictures the most convenient, the mostpossible to acquire and keep in large numbers?I am reminded of John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys as well as of the abbMichel de Marolles, who were the first great or systematic collectorsof engraved portraits, the Frenchman owning twenty thousand prints andall the portraits extant. Evelyn wrote to Pepys advising him to collectthem, for, as he said, some are so well done to the life that theymay stand in competition with the best paintings. He then adds: Thiswere a cheaper and so much a more useful curiosity as they seldom arewithout their names, ages and eulogies of the persons whose portraitsthey represent. I say you will be exceedingly pleased to contemplatethe effigies of those who have made such a noise and bustle in theworld, either by their madness and folly, or a more conspicuous figureby their wit and learning. They will greatly refresh you in your studyand by your fireside when you are many years returned. We later seehim write in his Diary that he had sat to the great Nanteuil whohad been knighted by the king for his art and had considered himselfunworthy of being included in that gallery of models whom Nanteuilsart has made famous. We know by his own Diary that Pepys becamean enthusiastic collector and that he went over to Paris to buy manyprints by the great engraver, at a later date commissioning his wife tosecure for him many more which he strongly desired.Portrait-painting had at that time become a mania, and there was noone of any prominence who did not wish to leave to posterity a recordof his physical appearance. Richelieu in a single order had calledfor an entire gallery full of portraits of celebrities. The French_peintre-graveurs_ proved how effectively color could be translatedinto black and white, and by revealing the true relation of engravingto painting shared the fame of their contemporaries in the other arts.It is not possible for the lover of prints to glance at thisinterminable gallery and not be amazed at the number of portraits whichshow much originality in their treatment and infinite skill in theirexecution, but I defy the admirer of truth in art not to be impressedby the small number of those by other engravers which are distinguishedby both simplicity and conviction. The heads of Mellan, which weredrawn with as few lines as possible, remain absurdly unique, and theetched portraits of Morin, who was a faithful translator of Philippede Champaigne, are too personal for comparison. But the mass of the_peintre-graveurs_ give constant proofs of having been influenced byNanteuils method, and in the case of Van Schuppen there is a veryclose following indeed in the masters footsteps. He is supposed tohave been his favorite pupil.Nevertheless, Edelinck, brilliant colorist as he was and a wonderfullyclever artist with his burin, refused to do any original work and toofrequently attempted to add vigor and brilliancy to the portraits hecopied. In modeling his faces he, in the opinion of Nanteuil himself,broke his lines unnecessarily. The work of Masson lacks quiet andbalance, when his faces are not out of drawing, while that of therest of the school displays that great vitality and style which madeit a model for all the artists of the following century, without,however, combining these qualities with the solidity, consummatescience, and restraint which characterize almost all Nanteuilsportraits.[Illustration: NANTEUIL. LOUIS XIVEngraved in 1666 from Nanteuils own drawing from lifeLouis XIV was twenty-eight years of age when this portrait was engravedIn appearance Louis, though admirably proportioned, was slightly belowthe middle height. His eyes were blue, his nose long and well formed.His hair, which was remarkable for its abundance, was allowed to fallover his shoulders. With his handsome features and his serious--perhapsphlegmatic--expression he seemed admirably fitted to play the part of amonarch.

ANNE OF AUSTRIA, QUEEN OF FRANCEEngraved in 1666 from Nanteuils own design from lifeAnne of Austria was the daughter of Philip III of Spain, wife of LouisXIII of France and mother of Louis XIV. She was Regent from 1643 to1661.Size of the original engraving, 19  16 inches]Nothing more admirable has been done in the realm of engraving thanthese quiet prints in which there is no affectation, no parade oftechnical brilliance, and it is a question whether anything moresincere has been accomplished in the history of portraiture. Theportraits of Nanteuil take their place with perfect dignity alongsideof the subtle crayon portraits of the courtiers of Henry VIII atWindsor Castle, and the exquisite drawings of the courtiers ofFrancis I and Henry II, which alone would make Chantilly worthy of apilgrimage. Nanteuils drawing is perfect and his massing of tonesmasterly; his expression of texture has both realism and breadth, andhis indication of skin by means of a system of very close and delicateshort strokes is an admirable solution of a problem which had been thedespair of the entire school.The most superficial study of his modeling of that side of the facewhich is in full light, for instance, will reveal the supreme delicacy,the never-failing tact, with which he carries out this most difficultpart of the work. His burin is as light as a feather, there is not aline too many, and he knows the exact value of each and every tone. Itis interesting to note that, according to one of his pupils, he hadmade a careful study of the chiaroscuro of Leonardo, a master for whomhe had an especial admiration.The great simplicity of his composition allowed him to concentrate allthe resources of his art on the expression of character in the head.With an understanding of character which was the most sympathetic ofhis day, he strove to represent his model with all the outward calmof nature which was possible in an age when form reigned supreme andevery one was _en parade_. To secure this touch of life Nanteuil, atthe last sitting, would do everything in his power to bring out in hissitters face that look of amused attention which is so characteristicof his portraits, with the result that, as a brilliant critic hasrecently remarked, instead of one vivid impression his portrait is thesum of many impressions, a balanced conclusion rather than a singlepiece of evidence. It is this which makes his work so interestingas a historical document. Here we see in the truest light the divinemonarch, the arrogant noble, the worldly prelate, the seriousman-of-letters, and the humble commoner who fill all the French memoirsof the seventeenth century.It is indeed high time that the artist who has been called the LouisXIV of engraving came into his own again, or that he at least beaccorded some of the immense popularity which he enjoyed during thepalmy days of the _grand sicle_. For two centuries he has lain in anobscurity which it is not easy to understand, in spite of the fact thathis style of portraiture went out of fashion long before the greatmonarch died. It remained extremely unpopular throughout the eighteenthcentury, for what could those austere bust portraits against a plaindark background, in the simplest of settings, have in common withthe decorative compositions of the days of Louis XV, in which velvetand embroideries, ermine and rich lace, inlaid armor, canopies andcomplicated furniture, played such an important part? In comparisonwith these decorative panels they seem cold and uninteresting, but onthe other hand they alone represent real portraiture; they reflect theearnestness of Port-Royal.[Illustration: NANTEUIL.

BERNARD DE FOIX DE LA VALETTE, DUC DEPERNONEngraved in 1650 from Nanteuils own drawing from lifeThis man was the son of the Duc dEpernon, who was seated in thecarriage with Henry IV at the time when the king was assassinated.The Duc was suspected of complicity in the plot, but this never wasproved. Both the elder and the younger Espernon were extremely haughtyand arrogant men. Their possessions in Guienne were of an almost royalcharacter and they governed them practically independent of the royalauthority. Both were associated with the reactionary party.J. B. Perkins, _France under Richelieu and Mazarin_.Size of the original engraving, 12  10 inches]There cannot have been a time when they were not admired by those whopossessed true artistic perception, but there is no indication that anyspecial value was attached to them or that they were collected. Sufficeit to say that at the Mariette sale, in 1775, the complete works ofNanteuil, two hundred and eighty proofs of two hundred and sixteenplates in choice impressions, realized only a trifle over one hundreddollars. More than five times that sum has recently been paid for onesingle print. In 1825, at a famous auction, record prices of twelvedollars and nine dollars were paid respectively for the portraits of_Pompone de Bellivre_ and _Richelieu_. Half a century later theirvalue was not much greater, and general interest in them remaineddormant until four years ago when the collecting world suddenlyrealized their artistic worth, and made a raid on the leading marketsof Europe.It is said that Nanteuil kept a journal; if so, we must greatlydeplore the fact that it has not been preserved to us, for we wouldhave been treated to a delightful account of the habits of paintersin that time and to many anecdotes connected with their sittings. Whoshall ever know the number of Nanteuils sitters? His studio was foundfull of pastel portraits many of which had never been engraved, andhis pencil and pen sketches seem to have been innumerable. In spiteof his reputation of _bon vivant_ and his popularity with both the_bourgeoisie_ and the nobility, allusions to Nanteuil in the memoirsof the day are fragmentary and we know little about the man. We aretold, however, that he was born in Rheims about 1630 and that he drewso persistently during his school years that his studies were sadlyneglected. It was only through the excellence of the frontispiece whichhe engraved for his thesis that he succeeded in securing his degree.The conscientious engraver Regnesson taught him all he knew, gave himhis sister in marriage, and sent him to Paris, not to complete hisapprenticeship, for Nanteuil was already more famous than his master,but in order to place him under the influence of the court painters.In the great city his wit and conviviality won him many friends andhis talent for securing an excellent likeness secured him instantfame. It is said that he received his first order by following somedivinity students to a wine-shop where they were wont to take theirmeals. There, having chosen one of the portraits he had brought fromRheims, he pretended to look for a sitter whose name and address hehad forgotten. It is superfluous to add that the picture was notrecognized, but it was passed from hand to hand, the price was asked,the artist was modest in his demands, and before the end of the repasthis career had begun. He made so many portraits in a week that hewas advised by a famous connoisseur to limit his production to four.At night he copied them in pen-and-ink for the sake of familiarizinghimself with that burin work which later was to astonish Europe.During many months he catered to the growing demand for the portrait,with drawings in the style of those of the Clouets and theDumonstiers. One has but to realize in what favor all portrait-makerswere in those days in order to understand how this peculiarly giftedartist sprang into such sudden popularity. The dignity of Frenchportrait-painting was being upheld by the noble Philippe de Champaigne,under whose influence the painters of the time produced a great numberof portraits which, if not technically brilliant, were presented withthat serious dignity which was characteristic of the early seventeenthcentury and were drawn with admirable sincerity and correctness. To himNanteuil went for advice and encouragement, and soon after presentedthe engraved copy of the painters latest portrait; it met with so muchsuccess that it can be said to have started the tremendous vogue of theengraved portrait and the formation of the great school which Colbertinstalled at the Gobelins.Meanwhile the artist, already a perfect draughtsman and very proficientwith pastels, had carefully studied the technique of all the leadingengravers, and as soon as he had evolved a system of his own bent allhis efforts on revolutionizing the art. Nanteuil made a picturesquedbut during that incredible opera-bouffe, the War of the Fronde. Hewas draughted into military service, but although frequently activewith a blunderbuss and wearing a false beard in imitation of thedreaded Swiss mercenaries, he succeeded in making a portrait of all theheroes of the day. For him sat _Cond_ and the _Duc dEpernon_, thelast representative of feudalism in France; the _Ducs de Bouillon_,_de Mercur_, _de Nemours_, and _de Beaufort_, who met in taverns toappoint the generals of an army which did not exist; the Archbishopof Paris, _de Retz_, who appeared in Parliament armed like a pirate;that fat poet and peasant _Loret_, who sold on street corners hisMuse Historique, a daily satire on the intriguing nobles who werenot afraid of bullets but who were in deadly fear of winter mud,and lastly the indomitable prime minister, _Cardinal Mazarin_, whomthe populace twice drove from Paris and then so madly welcomed backthat many were trampled to death in the riot. Of that wily Italian heengraved as many as fourteen portraits.During the few years which followed the civil war he made his mostinteresting portraits.It was then that he assiduously frequented the literary salons of thecapital where, a poetaster of some renown, he was ever welcome and madethat beautiful pastel portrait of _Madame de Svign_ which has beenpreserved to us, and another of _Mlle. de Scudry_, who thanked him asfollows:  Nanteuil en faisant mon image  A de son art divin signal le pouvoir,  Je hais mes traits dans mon miroir,  Je les aime dans son ouvrage.At this time he engraved the set of small-size portraits whichrepresents the high-water mark of his talent. Can one possibly imagineanything more exquisitely choice than his heads of _Maridat_ thephilosopher and _Hugues de Lionne_ the secretary for foreign affairs?With equal excellence he made the portraits of _Chapelain_, one of thefounders of the French Academy, who reported himself to the King asa greater poet than Corneille, _Scudry_, who signed the popularnovels written by his sister, the witty _Marquis de St. Brisson_,the poets _Loret_ and _Sarrazin_, the genial _Abb de Marolles_,savant and print-collector, the learned octogenarian _Le Vayer_, andthe ex-preceptor of the King, the archbishop of Paris, _Prfixe deBeaumont_.[Illustration: NANTEUIL.

FRANOIS DE LA MOTHE LE VAYEREngraved in 1661 from Nanteuils own drawing from lifeFew were Le Vayers equal either in wit or learning. His writings wereexceedingly numerous. Regarded as the Plutarch of his century for hisboundless erudition and his mode of reasoning. He died at the age ofeighty-six, in 1672, having enjoyed good health to the last days of hislife.Size of the original engraving, 10  7 inches]These portraits owe their size to the fact that they had been usedas frontispieces for the works of those various personages, but thespecial care, the _con amore_ finish with which they are executed,is due to the fact that the subjects were warm personal friendsof the artist. The portrait of _John Evelyn_ was made in the sameway, although before the artists technique had reached its fullestdevelopment.Before the year 1660 Nanteuil made, besides many portraits includingthose mentioned above and several of Mazarin, four very remarkableones of a larger size. They are those of _Cardinal de Coislin_, theyoung _Duc de Bouillon_, _Marie de Bragelogne_, and the abb _BasileFouquet_. The prelate was a Jesuit who became chaplain of Versailles;the youth, as lord chamberlain of France, had the honor of handingthe King his nightshirt, an honor which he forfeited forever when ontwo successive nights he forgot his gloves. The woman was an old loveof Richelieu; the delicate modeling of her careworn face is worthyof Holbeins best manner and is executed with a tact that bafflesdescription. This plate reminds us of the fact that out of two hundredand sixteen portraits Nanteuil made only eight of women; of theseonly two were made from life,--that of _Anne of Austria_ and the onementioned above, but they are gems of purest ray serene which makeus sigh when we think of what he could have done with Henrietta ofEngland and Mesdames de Lavallire, de Montespan, and de Maintenon!As to the fourth portrait, it is that of the brother of the great_Surintendant des Finances_, Nicolas Fouquet; he was at that time thehead spy of Mazarin as well as the chancellor of the orders of the Kingand the most accomplished rascal who ever fished in troubled waters.These four engraved portraits are masterpieces of characterization, andexhibit in the most eloquent way the masters powerful draughtsmanship,his utter lack of mannerisms, and the sympathetic way in which hevaried his entire technical treatment to suit different subjects.Here is abundant proof that he was primarily a portrait-maker, that,in spite of the fact that he handled the burin with as much ease andsureness as his pencil and chalks, he never strove after effect andnever allowed his skill to carry him away and mar the unity of hisperfectly balanced composition. He is a psychologist who consistentlystrove to brand his models soul on his countenance. Of no other_peintre-graveur_ can we say as much.With the year 1660 came the royal marriage, and a twelvemonth laterthe death of the despotic Mazarin and the emancipation of the youngKing. Nanteuils fame by this time was thoroughly established, he waseverywhere recognized as a past-master of his art and was in a positionto refuse as many orders as he pleased. The leading men in the church,the parliament, and the _bourgeoisie_, which always followed the leadof the nobility, did not rest until they had the artist from Rheimsengrave their portraits and strike off many hundred impressions, whichwere quickly enough distributed among their families and friends.Among them were the Matre dHtel and the physician of the King,_Guenault_, the quack who looked after the health of the Queen,and _Dreux dAubray_, who became the first victim of his daughter,the famous murderess, the Marquise de Brinvilliers. The two greatprotectors of Nanteuil at this time were _Michel Le Tellier_ and_Nicolas Fouquet_. Of the former, who was then war minister and who aschancellor of France died the day after signing the fatal Revocationof the Edict of Nantes, we have ten convincing portraits, as wellas five of his son _Charles Maurice_ who became the worldliest ofarchbishops, and one of his eldest son who became the dreaded warminister _Louvois_. These sixteen portraits of the Le Tellier familyrepresent some of Nanteuils best work. The portrait of _Fouquet_ is agreat historical document, a piece of most subtle characterization donein the artists best manner, and it is interesting to note that it wasmade only a very short time before the sensational fall of that thenmost powerful man in the kingdom. Could we but know what thoughts ranthrough the head of the Lord of Vaux as he sat for his portrait with aquizzical smile! Nanteuil, by the way, has left us the record of theappearance of practically all the principal figures of that sensationaltrial which lasted three years and the outcome of which alone assuredthe complete independence of the King.Nanteuil had now patrons influential enough to insure him a graciouswelcome at court. His greatest ambition had been to paint the youngKing and he felt able to improve greatly on the efforts of bothMignard and Lebrun. With this end in view he addressed to the King apetition for a sitting in such eloquent verse that the request wasreadily granted. The first pastel portrait of the King seems to havemade a small sensation at court; Come and look at your husband in thisportrait, madame, said Anne of Austria to the young Queen; he fairlyspeaks. Still greater, however, was the Kings delight when he saw theengraved copy of the portrait which Nanteuil later presented to him.He rewarded with a gift of 4000 livres the artist whom he had alreadynamed court painter and engraver with a lodging at the Gobelins, and atwhose bidding he had raised the status of engraving to a fine art.There are in all eleven of these portraits of Louis XIV and theygive us an excellent idea of the haughty appearance, the conceitedexpression of the demigod during the happiest period of his life. Whatcare we for the old monarch who later was caricatured by the pompof Rigauds painting and the satire of Thackeray? This is the youngAlexander who has just seized the reins of government and set up themost brilliant court in history. In the earliest one he is twenty-sixyears old, madly in love with Mlle. de La Vallire, and buildingVersailles with feverish haste; at the last sitting he is thirty-eightand hopelessly under the sway of Madame de Montespan. Here he bears ourgaze with a contemptuous air, the man who, if he was not the greatestof kings, was the greatest actor of majesty who ever filled a throne.These portraits were considered extraordinary in point of resemblance.The great Bernini himself, who had come from Italy to make a bust ofthe King, warmly congratulated the engraver on the best portraitever made of his Majesty, and this before the leading personages ofthe court.[Illustration: NANTEUIL. NICOLAS FOUQUETEngraved in 1661 from Nanteuils own design from lifeOf the three ministers to whom Louis had openly given his confidence,Lionne, Le Tellier, and Fouquet, the last named was the only one whopossessed the qualities necessary for a prime minister.It was generally believed, says Madame de La Fayette, that theSuperintendent would be called upon to take the Government into hishands. There is no doubt whatever that Fouquet himself expectedeventually to succeed Mazarin. Arthur Hassall, _Louis XIV_.Size of the original engraving, 13  10 inches][Illustration: NANTEUIL.

Many of the nobles must have ownedcomplete sets. They met with such favor that during the last four yearsof his life the artist engraved entirely in that size, about twenty-twoinches by thirty, and had started a gallery of all the great men ofFrance; he had actually produced as many as thirty-six before he diedin 1678. The list includes the portraits of the Queen Mother _Anne ofAustria_, decked out in all her finery a few weeks before she died,that of the young _Dauphin_, the effeminate brother of the King the_Duc dOrlans_, _Colbert_, _Turenne_, _Louvois_, _Bossuet_, the _Ducde Chaulnes_, and several other celebrities. They are admirable platesin which he secured broad masses and simple effects by means of thesame system he used in his small portraits. In spite of the very largesurface and what seems like a million lines there is no confusion, nota flaw in the unity of his composition. They had formed the specialadmiration of the last Medici Duke of Tuscany when, on a visit toFrance, he had insisted on meeting Nanteuil. From him he purchased forthe Uffizi Gallery in Florence the portrait of the painter himselfand those of the King and Turenne. He moreover obliged him to accepta pupil _dans lintimit_, a thing which Nanteuil had never donefor he always locked himself up when he engraved his plates. It wasthat Domenico Tempesti who has left us such an interesting record ofthe habits of the engraver and the ideas he held on the subject ofportraiture. It is from him that we know that the master made all thosedelightful pastel portraits in three sittings of exactly two hourseach. Would that we knew how long it took him to engrave them! we canonly form a vague idea of this from the fact that in his most prolificyear he made fifteen engraved portraits. Robert-Dumesnil limits toten the portraits engraved entirely by Nanteuil; the selection hemakes is judicious, but the number was certainly far greater. Ofcourse the purely mechanical draughting of the frame and the fillingof the background was the work of assistants, and it is more thanprobable that in many of the less important plates and in the life-sizeportraits, on account of the great surface to be covered, the costumewas engraved by such pupils as Pitau and Van Schuppen, for instance,as their cleverness for such work almost equaled their masters. Butin all the small portraits and those of _Turenne_ and the _Ducs deBouillon_, for instance, we recognize everywhere the vigorous yettactful touch of Nanteuil himself.[Illustration: NANTEUIL. JEAN CHAPELAINEngraved in 1655 from Nanteuils own drawing from lifeJean Chapelain, born at Paris, December 4, 1595, died February 22,1674.

POMPONE DE BELLIVREEngraved in 1657 (when Nanteuil was twenty-seven years of age) afterthe painting by Charles Lebrun. By many authorities it has beendescribed as the most beautiful of all engraved portraits.Size of the original engraving, 12  9 inches]Reproductive work was for Nanteuil an exception. The plates which heengraved from the paintings of other artists number thirty-eight;to each of them he affixed the name of the painter with a fairnesswhich Edelinck, for one, seldom exhibited. It is natural that theseplates should show little of that inspiration and originality whichwere distinctive of a born character student like the artistfrom Rheims, but the majority are supremely interesting and thefinest are masterpieces. It is evident that in the earliest ones,notably in the head of _Chavigny_, reputed a son of Richelieu, he wasexperimenting with technique and that several others which were usedas frontispieces were merely potboilers. Even the portrait of Queen_Christina of Sweden_ and the much overrated one of the Dutch lawyer_van Steenberghen_ are nothing more than interesting studies of simplelinework and softness of tone. In those of the two little sons of theDuchesse de Longueville, the _Comte de Dunois_ and the _Comte de SaintPaul_, we see how easy it was for Nanteuils technique to express thesoft outline and the tender complexion of youth with a charming effect.After Lebrun he engraved with an admirable chiaroscuro the head ofthe Chancellor _Seguier_, and that well-known portrait of _Pompone deBellivre_, statesman and philanthropist, which, if lacking in vigor,represents the highest point reached by the intelligent refinement oflinework. But it is only with the sober and precise work of his masterPhilippe de Champaigne that Nanteuil had a positive affinity. The twoartists held identical views about portraiture and the Flemish painterfound in the engraver from Rheims an interpreter who fairly breathed inunison with him. It is not possible to imagine anything more admirablethan the engraved portraits of _de Neufville_, bishop of Chartres,_Richelieu_, and Marshal _Turenne_. They undoubtedly represent the lastword on the subject of line-engraving. The face of the Cardinal istreated with all the subtlety of Velasquez and the head of the greatestcaptain of his time is modeled with a strength of coloring whichRembrandt himself would have admired. This plate shows in the clearestway Nanteuils ability to represent different textures: the hair, skin,lace, silk, and steel armor are treated with precision which is whollysatisfying and a breadth which commands the highest admiration.From the inventory made in his house the day after his death we learnthat Nanteuil had for years been dissipating in extravagant livingthe large sums he had earned with his work. His household goods, hisdrawings, and the tools of his profession were sold under the hammer,and it is amusing at the present day to realize that a lot consistingof 2966 of his prints, together with many reams of paper and hisprinting-press, were valued at only seven hundred dollars.It is also explained why most of his portraits went through so manydifferent states; it was chiefly on account of the theses. A curiousfashion it was by which wealthy students in law, philosophy, and thearts formally dedicated their graduating theses to one or anotherdistinguished personage whose engraved portrait they ordered from a_peintre-graveur_. This, with a lengthy dedication, was then attachedto the printed thesis as a frontispiece and sent to the patron andto many of his friends. It is thus that the Chancellor dAligrecommissioned Nanteuil, who had the monopoly of such work, to engraveand strike off twenty-five hundred proofs of a new and extra-largeportrait of the King measuring thirty inches by forty-two for his sonsthesis; for this and the printing of the thesis itself the engraverreceived the sum of 10,400 livres, or about $9000 of our money. Theprice of an ordinary engraved portrait was $2000. Other lesswealthy postulants had to be content with ordering a reimpression ofa plate which had already been used and which needed only a change ofdedication. In this way the portrait of the Dauphin for instance wentthrough fifteen states and one of the King went through eleven; theplates were naturally often retouched by the artist in order to enablethem to withstand so much use. Not to these theses alone, however, mustthe great number of royal portraits which were printed be attributed,for they had become immensely popular throughout the kingdom andwhoever could afford it had one hanging in his house. In 1667 Cardinalde Bouillon ordered the portrait of the King for his thesis, and someyears later another student selected for his patron the Cardinalhimself. In 1675 it was the son of dArtagnan, dear to all lovers ofromance, who was presented by his father with the finest of the Kingsportraits for his thesis.[Illustration: NANTEUIL.

In the case of Fouquet, the second of five states of hisportrait was made necessary by a mistake in spelling in the dedication,the others being undoubtedly due to the touching-up of the plate onaccount of the great number of impressions ordered by a powerful manthe circle of whose friends constituted the real court of that time. Inthe case of Cardinal Mazarin, politics undoubtedly played a great partin the use which was made of his portraits.It is not generally known that Nanteuil was himself the author of mostof the titles and dedications both in prose and in verse, in Latin aswell as in French, which form such an attractive feature of his prints.This was to be expected of the clever versifier who had written suchamusing sonnets to the royal family and the leaders of the court inconnection with their sittings, and of the cheerful companion who hadknown so intimately the _beaux-esprits_ whom the hospitality of Fouquethad so often convened at his chteau of Vaux. To the Queen, who had acomplexion of marvelous whiteness, he wrote a poem thanking her forthe order for her portrait, which ended with this line: _Mais prenonscourage, on a peint le soleil mme avec un charbon!_Nanteuils original drawings in pencil, crayons, and pastels are fewerby far than those of the Clouets or the pastellists of the eighteenthcentury which have been preserved to us; probably not more than twentyare now to be found in public collections. To my knowledge the Louvrehas two, the Museum of Rheims four, the Chartres Museum one, Florencethree, Chantilly four, and Stafford House, London, six. They aresupremely interesting for that simplicity and sincerity, that livingtruth, which make one feel as if he recognized old acquaintances. Asfor his engravings, there are splendid collections of them in Paris,Dresden, and Chantilly, and there doesnt exist a private collection ofany importance in the world which does not contain some of the noblework of the past-master of engraved portraiture, the painter of themost brilliant period in modern history, the genial artist who hadsaid to his pupil: _Le temps et la peine ne font pas tant les beauxouvrages que la bonne humeur et lintelligence._REMBRANDTS LANDSCAPE ETCHINGSBY LAURENCE BINYONAssistant-Keeper of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum Author ofDutch Etchers, Painting in the Far East, etc.The pioneers of landscape art, those who have opened up newpossibilities of design in landscape themes, were, at least until thenineteenth century, certain great masters of figure-painting. Titian,Rubens, Velasquez, Rembrandt, each of these gave a fresh impulse to thepainting of landscape, an impulse which even to-day has not lost itsinspiration; while the conventions established by Claude, Ruysdael andSalvator Rosa seem by comparison tame and more or less artificial ordemoded.Of these masters Rembrandt is the nearest to modern feeling. Thefamous _Mill_, in which a landscape motive is treated with a richnessand depth of humanity that hitherto had found expression only infigure-subjects, stands in this respect as a monument in European art.Yet landscapes form a very small proportion of Rembrandts paintings.Rembrandt as a painter rarely seems to treat landscape for its ownsake. He composes for the most part arbitrarily, using broad spaces oflevel and hill-masses with ruined towers as the material elements ofa scene for which some visionary play of gleam and cloud seems thereal motive in his mind, the counterpart of the emotions he sought tocommunicate and evoke.We are now concerned with Rembrandt as an etcher. Here again theproportion of landscape to figure-subjects is small. There are sevenand twenty out of a total of some three hundred etchings.We note at once that the etched landscapes present a different aspectfrom the painted landscapes.In his paintings Rembrandt shows none of the characteristics of thenational landscape school of Holland, of those artists who reliedon the features of their native land,--its wide pastures, itscanals, its seaports, its sand-dunes, its farms, its great skiesand immense horizons,--and made of the plain portraiture of thesefamiliar scenes their pride and glory. Rather he took hints from histraveled countrymen and the painters who had sought the classic South.Landscape, whether treated simply or as an adjunct to some scene fromScriptural story, was to him a source of romantic appeal. And justas Italian masters, like Botticelli, have sometimes introduced asbackground foreign scenes from the Rhineland suggested by the workof Northern painters, so Rembrandt, to whom mountains had all thefascination of strangeness and romance, took from actual drawings ofTitians school which he may have possessed or seen, or from picturesby traveled Dutchmen like Hercules Seghers, the features he desired,fusing them into a world of his own imagination.The etchings, on the contrary, are for the most part pure Holland. Yettheir inspiration is very different from that of the typical Dutchpainter or etcher. They are not mere portraits of places. Even whenapparently simple transcripts from the scene before the artists eyes,the composing spirit is at work in them, rearranging and suppressing.And perhaps just because of this absence of the literal topographicalspirit, they seem to contain the essential genius and atmosphere ofDutch landscape.Practically all Rembrandts landscape work belongs to the middle periodof his life. Some writers have sought to account for this by supposingthat he turned to such subjects in some rural retreat to soothe hisoverwhelming grief at the loss of his wife. The actual dates hardlysupport this supposition. Saskia died in the summer of 1642. But thelandscapes begin a few years before that date. The first ten years ofthe masters life at Amsterdam--the years of his prosperity--were, weknow, crowded with portrait commissions; and landscape work would onlyhave been a relaxation. It was hardly more than this at any time, butfor some reason it interested him more during the ten or twelve yearsafter 1640 than in his youth or old age.The earliest date on a landscape etching is 1641; the latest, 1652. Theundated plates can be placed with tolerable certainty within a year orso.In 1634 Rembrandt had etched the large _Annunciation to the Shepherds_,in which the landscape is of the same visionary kind as appears in thepaintings. The general effect is of white on black, the supernaturaleffulgence in the sky, which so startles the shepherds and theirflocks, calling out of the gloom mysterious waving heights of foliageand obscure gleams of distance.[Illustration: REMBRANDT. THE WINDMILLIn the _Windmill_ Rembrandt found a perfect subject. There is noadventitious impressiveness lent by strong effect of light and shadowin this beautiful plate: all is plain and simply rendered.... We feelthe stains of weather, the touch of time, on the structure; we feel theair about it and the quiet light that rests on the far horizon as theeye travels over dike and meadow.... Laurence Binyon.Size of the original etching, 5  8 inches][Illustration: REMBRANDT. VIEW OF AMSTERDAMIn the little _Amsterdam_, as in nearly all these etchings, the skyis left absolutely clear and empty. And how far more truly it suggeststo us the brightness of a cloudless day than the most successful ofplein-air painting in vivid color, which stops the imagination insteadof leaving it free and active! This little plate is filled with air andsun. Laurence Binyon.Size of the original etching, 4  6 inches]In none of the etchings of pure landscape does Rembrandt adopt thismethod and conception. None of them has that effect of illuminatedgloom which is so peculiarly associated with the masters name. Theireffect is of black on white, and the line is given its full value. Oneof the earliest, probably, is a small plate (B. 207), sometimes called_A Large Tree and a House_. I believe some critics have cast a doubt onit, but it is unmistakably Rembrandts in conception and handwriting.The little piece might well be called _Twilight_. We seem to be nearthe shores of a lake; light is fading out of the sky and scarcelypermits us to discern any details; the presence of a few figures and ahuman dwelling is felt rather than seen. All is gray and quiet; nothingstands out saliently. It is the silvery evenness of tone which is thecharm of this tiny plate, in no way striking, yet indefinably revealinga masters hand. Usually Rembrandt would make such quiet etched work,all of one biting, the basis of a rich effect produced by dry-point. Hemay have intended to have used the dry-point here, but perhaps thoughtthe scale was too small.With the _Windmill_ and the _Cottage and Hay-barn_, both dated 1641, wecome to a group of plates which are typical of Rembrandts landscapemanner in etching. Close to these in date, presumably, are the little_Amsterdam_ and the _Cottage and Large Tree_. Mr. Hind, in the latestcatalogue of the etchings, follows von Seidlitz in assigning the_Amsterdam_ to 1640, though Dr. Six maintains that the absence of atower not finished till 1638 proves it to be earlier than that year.Rembrandt, however, was quite capable of abolishing towers to suit hiscomposition. The simplest materials presented by the country-side areused in these etchings. Though Rembrandt never seems to have cared tomake pictures of such subjects, he made a great number of drawings ofthem. A wonderful series of these sketches, once in the possession ofhis pupil, Govert Flinck, is at Chatsworth; and numbers of course inthe great public collections. These summary small drawings, made witha reed-pen and sepia, and sometimes with a wash of sepia added, do notappeal to every one, certainly not to those whose pleasure is in theexternal aspect of things, the softness of verdure, the glitter oftrees; to say nothing of the want of grandeur and impressiveness in thescenes themselves, the absence of anything scenic, such as makes themost obvious appeal, whether in nature or art.But the more one studies drawings, and the more one becomes familiarwith the qualities which differentiate the first-rate from the second,the higher one inclines to rank these sketches. For one thing, theyare almost miraculous in the certainty with which the reality ofthings is evoked, and the planes of recession indicated. Slight asis the means employed, rough and summary as is the stroke of theblunt pen, sometimes even with what seems a superficial clumsiness orcarelessness, the things seen are there,--trees, buildings, bridgesand canals, men and women,--and not only visible but, as it were,tangible. We can walk in imagination into these little landscapes, andnot only do we breathe an infinite air but we are sure of every step.And this is the great test of mastery in such drawings. Take, forinstance, the landscape drawings of Domenico Campagnola, which are alsoin reed-pen and sepia. These, with their broken foregrounds, uplandfarms among trees of delicate foliage, and distant mountain-ranges,are much more attractive to the eye at first sight than the greatDutchmans sketches. But when in imagination we move into thesepleasant landscapes, we are disconcerted by unrealities; our steps areuncertain, for they are not on solid ground. And in fact a pleasantpattern of pen-strokes remains a pattern and nothing else. ButRembrandts rough strokes have somehow molded all the ground with itssaliences and depressions and filled the whole with light and air.It is the same with the etchings. But there is a difference: thedifference of the medium. True artist as he is, Rembrandt conceives allhe does in the terms of the material used. His etchings are born asetchings and nothing else; they are not drawings transferred to copper.There is a specific beauty of the etched line which is quite differentfrom the beauty of a line made by the pen or chalk, or the lineploughed by a burin on copper. If it is unsuited to the sweepingrhythms of large movement in design, such as we associate with Rubens,for instance, its want of modulation and even character help a quietdignity of draughtsmanship; and the etcher has means of enhancinghomeliness of detail unrivaled in any other medium. Old buildings,wharves, boats and shipping at a river-side or quay,--such things asthese naturally attract the etcher, for they are congenial to hismedium. And in the _Windmill_ (B. 233, dated 1641), Rembrandt found aperfect subject.There is no adventitious impressiveness lent by strong effect of lightand shadow in this beautiful plate: all is plain and simply rendered.But we have only to compare this etching with the etchings of some ofRembrandts immediate predecessors, like Jan and Esaias Van de Velde,to see the difference not only between a great and an average artist,but between a great and a commonplace etcher. The picturesque traceryof a windmills sails and timber-work are seen and enjoyed in theVan de Veldes plates, but how much more than this is in Rembrandts_Mill_! We feel the stains of weather, the touch of time, on thestructure; we feel the air about it and the quiet light that restson the far horizon as the eye travels over dike and meadow; we areadmitted to the subtlety and sensitiveness of a sight transcending ourown; and even by some intangible means beyond analysis we partake ofsomething of Rembrandts actual mind and feeling, his sense of what theold mill meant, not merely as a picturesque object to be drawn, butas a human element in the landscape, implying the daily work of humanhands and the association of man and earth. Here is a classic in itskind which many generations of etchers have found an inspiring model.An accident in the biting apparently is the cause of an aquatint-likebroken tone of gray in the sky above the mill; but it comes withcongruous effect, and is rather a beauty than a blemish.In the little _Amsterdam_, as in nearly all these etchings, the sky isleft absolutely clear and empty. And how far more truly it suggeststo us the brightness of a cloudless day than the most successful ofplein-air painting in vivid color, which stops the imagination insteadof leaving it free and active! This little plate is filled with air andsun.A first state of this etching belongs to my friend Mr. Gustav Mayer inLondon, but is absolutely unknown to all catalogues previous to thatof Mr. Hind. In it there is a hare running over the fields, but it isa thought too big in scale, and Rembrandt doubtless suppressed it as adistracting incident.The _Cottage and Hay-barn_ (B. 225) and the _Cottage and Large Tree_(B. 226) seem companion plates; and though the latter is not dated,it is natural to assume for it the same date as that inscribed on theformer--1641. If the _Cottage and Large Tree_ is the finer of thesetwo oblong plates in design, the _Cottage and Hay-barn_ is the morebrilliant as an etching. The cottage and shed which give the plateits name are in the center of the design, and the dark mass, full oftender shadows and reflections, emphasizes by contrast the play of openlight on the fields stretching on either side, the river, the housenestling in a wood, beyond, and the distant towers of Amsterdam. Thoughall is treated in Rembrandts broad way, it is surprising how full,how suggestive of intimate detail the landscape is. As we look at itthere comes over us the sense of sleepy, bright air and sunshine, thequiet of the fields, in which, though nothing outwardly is happening,we are conscious of the stir of natural life, of growing things, offlowers and grass and insects, and peaceful human occupations goingon unobtrusively; of all the live murmur of a summers day. It isinteresting, in view of Rembrandts treatment of topography, to notethat Dr. Jan Six has shown that the master has here combined twodifferent views in a single composition.In the _Cottage with White Palings_ (B. 232, dated 1642), effectiveuse is made of the broad white planks of the fence to enforce thepattern of black and white in the design. Here again the subject isplaced in the center with views on either side, though the horizon ishigher than usual.With the _Three Trees_ (B. 212) of 1643, we come to the most famousof Rembrandts etched landscapes. This plate stands in the same sortof relation to the rest as the _Mill_ to the rest of his landscapepaintings. It is the grandest and most typical, most expressive ofthe masters temperament. Here the composition is less accidental,and more (so to speak) architectural. The group of three trees standsup darkly on a bank of high ground at the right. At the left onelooks over the level fields to the horizon and a glimmer of distantsea. A thunderstorm is passing away, with contorted clouds piled inthe upper sky and trailing over the plain, and rods of violent rainslant across the corner of the scene. For once Rembrandt builds up alandscape design out of sky and earth; and the something elementalwhich inspires it gives the etching a pregnancy and significance whichare absent from the other landscapes, in themselves, at their best,more intimately charming. There are those who object to the straight,hard lines of the rain; but I do not find them untrue, and they are ofgreat value in the design. Then, what beauties lurk in this etching,wherever one looks into it! The return of the light after rain, thanwhich there is nothing more beautiful in nature, gives a wet sparkleto the fields; and again we notice how the trees in their dark reliefgive glory to the space of luminous clearness beyond. The wagon onthe top of the high bank is moving toward the light, and a paintersits by the roadside, sketching the passing of the storm. An anglerfishes in a pool; lovers, hardly discerned, sit together, away from theworld in a thickets obscurity. All the plain, so solitary at firstsight, is filled with moving life. Of what particular species the threetrees are, it might be difficult, as often with Rembrandt, to say withconfidence; from their shape and the sturdy growth of their boughs, Isuppose them to be oaks. There is no doubt, however, about the willowin the _Omval_ (B. 209). The gnarled, seamed trunk of an old tree,with its rugged wrinkles and smooth bosses, irresistibly invites theetchers needle; and Rembrandt, like other etchers since, has evidentlyfound a great enjoyment in this willow-stem, as in that other oldwillow to which he added, not very felicitously, a St. Jerome reading,spectacles on nose, and a perfunctory lion (B. 232, dated 1648). The_Omval_ shows a different kind of composition; the willow at the edgeof a thicket, in whose shadow two lovers are embowered, divides theplate; the right and larger part is all light and open--a river-bank onwhich a man moves down to the ferry, and the broad sunny stream, andhouses, masts, and windmills across the water--a picturesque river-sidesuch as Whistler and Haden loved to etch.[Illustration: REMBRANDT. THE THREE TREESWith the _Three Trees_ of 1643, we come to the most famous ofRembrandts etched landscapes. This plate stands in the same sortof relation to the rest as the _Mill_ to the rest of his landscapepaintings. It is the grandest and most typical, most expressive of themasters temperament. Laurence Binyon.Size of the original etching, 8  11 inches][Illustration: REMBRANDT. SIXS BRIDGETo the same year--1645--belongs the well-known _Sixs Bridge_, a platein which the pure bitten line, with no close hatching or shadow-effect,is given full play. Of its kind, this is a perfect etching. LaurenceBinyon.Size of the original etching, 5  8 inches]To the same year--1645--belongs the well-known _Sixs Bridge_ (B.208), a plate in which the pure bitten line, with no close hatchingor shadow-effect, is given full play. Of its kind, this is a perfectetching. Every one knows the story of its being done while Sixsservant went to fetch the mustard. But there is nothing hasty orincomplete about it: the masterly economy of lines is perfectlysatisfying in its absolute directness and simplicity. There is greatpleasure in contemplating a work like this, so clean, so free from anysuperfluous element.But from this time onward Rembrandt seems to grow dissatisfied withpure etching. He grows more and more fond of dry-point, using it veryfrequently to enrich an etched plate, and in his later years preferringoften to dispense with the acid altogether.Dry-point is employed in the delightful little plate, the _Boat-house_(B. 231), to deepen the shadows of the arch over the water; but inordinary impressions this has worn off and only the groundwork ofbitten lines remains. This is the kind of subject which most artistswould have drawn in delicate detail; but Rembrandt is always ratherremarkably indifferent to the particular beauty and character ofvegetation (probably this was one of the reasons why he made so littleappeal to Ruskin); and it is surprising that with all the indifferenceand roughness in the drawing of the plant-forms on the river-bank, thelittle plate should still have so intimate a character and suggest somuch of the beauty of dark, quiet water in which reflections of flowerand herbage are asleep.In one or two of the plates of 1650 and thereabouts, as if tired oflevel horizons, Rembrandt closes the view with a mountain or range ofhills. Such are the _Canal and Angler_ and the _Boat in the Canal_ (B.235 and 236), which, joined together, form one composition; and onemight add the _Sportsman with Dogs_ (B. 211), though Mr. Hind assignsthe completion, at any rate, of this etching to a date of a few yearslater.[Illustration: REMBRANDT. LANDSCAPE WITH A BOAT IN THE CANALIn one or two of the plates of 1650 and thereabouts, as if tired oflevel horizons, Rembrandt closes the view with a mountain or range ofhills.

FARM WITH TREES AND A TOWER [LANDSCAPE WITH ARUINED TOWER AND CLEAR FOREGROUND]... a long, oblong plate, of great beauty for its pattern of light andshade. Part of the sky is shadowed, and the last light, before a showerpours over the trees, illuminates the foliage on one side. LaurenceBinyon.Size of the original etching, 4  12 inches]The _Hay-barn with Flock of Sheep_ (B. 224) is an instance ofa favorite feature in Rembrandts landscape--a road seen inperspective at one side of the design. The _Landscape with a CowDrinking_ (B. 237) is a beautiful etching in a rather slight manner,with a suggestion of wind in the branches of trees, and light comingwith the wind. Even in the _Three Trees_, though there is storm, thereis little impression of movement in the air; and it is characteristicof the landscape etchings as a whole that they are serene and still,and more often suggest a sunny day than gray skies.Dry-point becomes more emphatic in the _Obelisk_ (B. 227); indeed, inthe earliest impressions of this plate the black of the bur is toopronounced, and only after it had been printed from till this effecthad merged and blended with the etched lines was the right effectattained. Here the obelisk gives character to the design; and in the_Landscape with a Square Tower_ (B. 218) a building dominates,--an oldtower of rather blunted outlines, such as Rembrandt loved to crown darkhills with in the visionary landscapes of his painting.Another old tower occurs, less prominently, in the _Farm with Treesand a Tower_ (B. 223), a long, oblong plate, of great beauty for itspattern of light and shade. Part of the sky is shadowed, and the lastlight, before a shower pours over the trees, illuminates the foliageon one side. In the first two states there is a small cupola on thetower; but Rembrandt, no doubt rightly, judged that the design wouldbe improved by lopping it off. The change certainly subdues the localcharacter of the scene.Another long oblong of perhaps greater beauty is the _Gold-weighersField_ of 1651 (B. 234). This is all air and sun and space, theetched lines light and open, with dry-point adding a kind of gleam andvibration to the fertile fields. It is a revelation of what a greatartist can do, unaided by tone or color, with a scene that to theaverage eye would be tame enough. There is a sense, too, of the richesof the earth, the farmers pride in broad acres and growing crops,which gives a human touch, never absent from Rembrandts work.In contrast with this is another plate of the previous year--the _ThreeGabled Cottages_ (B. 217)--where the dry-point is freely used to givecolor and softness to the thatched roofs, checkered with the shadow ofan old tree. But it is the gratefulness of shadow in the noonday, notits gloom, which is the motive of the etching.The last group of landscapes are in pure dry-point. It is interestingto compare one of the earlier bitten plates with the _Road by theCanal_ (B. 221), delicious in its freshness and spontaneous effect, orthe _Clump of Trees with a Vista_ (B. 222). Of this last there is afirst state with a mere indication of part of the design; the trees,with the peep through the thicket, seem to have been an afterthought._The Wood over Palings_ (B. 364), the principal one of severalunfinished studies on one plate, has velvety dry-point in the foliage.It is a plate that seems to have served for inspiration to AndrewGeddes, the Scotch artist who was one of the first to inaugurate therevival of etching in the nineteenth century and to realize onceagain--what had been so unaccountably forgotten since Rembrandtstime--the possibilities and beauty of the dry-point method.[Illustration: REMBRANDT.

One ofthese backgrounds may be noticed for its special interest. About 1653Rembrandt took up a copperplate already etched by Hercules Seghers--a_Tobias and the Angel_ (after a composition of Elsheimers)--andtransformed it into a _Flight into Egypt_. Suppressing the two figures,which were of very large size in proportion to the design, he maskedthe traces of them by a mass of trees, put in his own figures on a muchsmaller scale, and by the most vigorous use of the dry-point wroughtthe whole into harmony. The treatment of shadowy masses of foliagereminds us how little there is of this element of landscape in theetchings we have been considering. There is nothing of that feeling forthe majesty and mystery of leafy forest-trees which Claude expressedso beautifully in the _Bouvier_ etching, and still more in his sepiadrawings. Critics have also remarked on other limitations of landscapeinterest in Rembrandt--the absence of seas and water in movement, thecomparative absence of wind and weather, in his etchings.For all that, when we think of the other Dutch etchers of landscape,we realize how far he towers over those who professed no othersubject,--over Molyn. Ruysdael, Everdingen, Waterloo, and Italianizerslike Both.Hercules Seghers is the one who showed most variety and temperament;and his work evidently had a great interest for Rembrandt. He wasa curious experimenter, and though he rarely seems quite master ofhis intentions, he was the antithesis of those landscape artists,so frequent, who take out a patent, as has been said, for someparticular corner or aspect of nature, and never do anything else butrepeat their favorite theme with variations.With Rembrandt landscape was a kind of interlude and holiday from moreserious design. We feel it in the sunny temper which pervades themajority of the etchings. But how far superior he is to all the restin his sensitiveness to beauty! As we have seen, he is not greatlyinterested in the details of landscape form. We find scribbles andshapelessness in his foliage and plants; but his grasp of essentialtruths overrides all criticism of this kind, and always and everywherewe feel his intense joy in expressing light. The etchings of hiscontemporaries seem cold and hueless, without air or sun, beside his.I find it hard to express a preference among the series. The _ThreeTrees_ stands by itself, but there are others which touch one with amore vivid charm. Turning from one to another, I find each arrestingthe eye with some particular beauty, though the set of oblong plates,from the _Cottage and Hay-barn_ to the _Gold-weighers Field_, contain,I think, the most delight; they are those in which all Holland seems tolie before us, with its pastures and its many peaceful waters.The landscape of Holland, with its level distances and low horizon, hasinexhaustible attractions for the painter of skies and atmosphere. Tothe born designer it is less stimulating. One of the things that mostimpress in any representative exhibition of Rembrandts etchings is theextraordinary variety and freshness of his designing. The proportionsof the plate, upright, square, or oblong; the relation of the figuresto the frame; the proportion of light to dark; the use of tone andline;--all these show a constant variety. Those who, when they think ofRembrandt, call up the image of a dark panel with light concentratedon a head or group in the middle of it, find a series of the etchingsquite subversive of their preconception.Now to an inventive designer like Rembrandt the resources of the Dutchlandscape offered but little. Where he blends landscape with figure,as in the infinitely pathetic _Burial of Christ_, or the _Woman ofSamaria_, or the _Christ Returning with His Parents from the Temple_,though the human types, as always, are taken from the world around theartist, the landscape is drawn from his imagination, or borrowed fromothers. In the _St. Jerome_ (B. 104) the background is no doubt takenfrom a Venetian drawing. Such methods were, indeed, inevitable, sinceone cannot go on weaving designs of human forms and landscape materialwhere the typical form of this last is little more than a straightline, or a series of straight lines, across the field of sight.One may wonder, perhaps with regret, why Rembrandt did not for onceetch a landscape of his inner vision, like those paintings at Casseland at Brunswick. It may be that he felt that for such tone-effectsetching was not the appropriate medium. Had he lived in a later day,he might have used mezzotint, as Turner did in his _Liber Studiorum_;and certainly that process should in his hands have yielded marvelousresults.But we may well be content with these landscape etchings which he hasleft us. They express the genius of the Dutch country, the virtueof it, as Pater would have said, as no other of his countrymen hasexpressed it. The series of plates in which Legros has expressed thegenius of the country of Northern France, with its poplar-borderedstreams and sunny pastures, has something of the same native quality.Each of these masters seems to have seized an essence which no onenot born of the soil, however enamoured of a lands beauty, can quitepossess and make his own.What is it that gives these landscapes their enduring charm, and whydo we rank them so high? Many a later etcher has had equal skill withneedle and acid; some have had even greater. Whistler is more delicate,perhaps, more exquisite, more unexpected in his gift of spacing. Yetneither Whistler nor any other master of etching has the secret powerof Rembrandt. I say secret, because we cannot argue about it orexplain it. It lay in what Rembrandt was: in the depth and greatnessof his humanity. When we have wondered at the sensitive instrument ofhis eyesight, when we have exalted his magical draughtsmanship, when wehave admired his instinctive fidelity to the capacity and limitationsof the medium used, when we have recognized the profound integrity ofhis art, there is still something left over, beyond analysis, and thatthe rarest thing of all.How it is we cannot say, but there has passed into these little worksan intangible presence, of which we cannot choose but be conscious,though it was not consciously expressed,--the spirit of one of thefullest, deepest natures that ever breathed. Whatever Rembrandt does,however slight, something of that spirit escapes him, some tinge ofhis experience,--of those thoughts, too deep for tears, which thingsmeaner than the meanest flowers could stir in him.GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI(1720-1778)PART IBY BENJAMIN BURGES MOOREThe life of Piranesi was eminently that of a man of genius,characterized by all the peculiarities ascribable to genius, perhaps asfailures of human nature, but also distinguished by that which impartsto its possessor an imperishable renown. Those peculiarities are worthyof notice, as they bear so much on the character of his work; but hisworks, wonderful as they are in point of execution, are less to beadmired for this than for the interest of the subjects he chose, _andthat which he imparted to them_. In an age of frivolities, he boldlyand single-handed dared to strike out for himself a new road to fame;and in dedicating his talents to the recording and illustrating fromancient writers the mouldering records of former times, he met with asuccess as great as it was deserved, _combining, as he did, all thatwas beautiful in art with all that was interesting in the remains ofantiquity_.These words were prefixed to an account of Piranesis career publishedin London during the year 1831 in The Library of the Fine Arts, andbased upon a sketch of his life written by his son, Francesco, butnever published, although the manuscript at that period had passedinto the hands of the publishers, Priestly and Weale, only to besubsequently lost or destroyed.[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESIFrom the engraving by F. Polanzani, dated 1750It is impossible to study this little known portrait without beingconvinced of its accurate likeness. It certainly conveys an impressionof the mans dmonic force, which is not given by the more frequentlyreproduced statue executed by Angelini.Size of the original etching, 15  11 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI.

It was dedicated 203 A.D. incommemoration of victories over the Parthians.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches]Eighty years, therefore, have passed since this evaluation of the greatItalian etcher was written, yet to-day he is no more appreciated athis full worth than he was then. At all times it has been not uncommonfor an artist to attain a kind of wide and enduring renown, althoughestimated at his true value and for his real excellences by only a few;but of such a fate it would be difficult to select a more strikingor illustrious example than Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Living anddying in the Eternal City, Rome, to whose august monuments his fameis inseparably linked, he was the author of the prodigious number ofover thirteen hundred large plates, combining the arts of etching andengraving, which, aside from their intrinsic merit as works of art, areof incalculable value on account of the inexhaustible supply of classicmotives which they offer to all designers, and to which they, more thanany other influence, have given currency.These prints, in early and beautiful proofs, are still to be bought atrelatively low figures, while each year sees the sale, by thousands,of impressions from the steeled plates still existing at Rome in theRoyal Calcography;--impressions which, although in themselves stillsufficiently remarkable to be worth possessing, are yet so debased asto constitute a libel upon the real powers of Piranesi.The wide diffusion of these ignoble prints, and the fact thatPiranesis output was so great as to place his work within the reachof the slenderest purse, are largely responsible for the failure ofthe general public to apprehend his real greatness; for rarity callsattention to merit, to which in fact it often gives a value entirelyfictitious, while there is always difficulty in realizing that thingsseen frequently and in quantities may have qualities far outweighingthose of work which has aroused interest by its scarcity. This is whythe fame of Piranesi is widely spread, although his best and mostcharacteristic work is almost unknown, and his real genius generallyunrecognized.Born in Venice, October 4th, 1720, and named after Saint Johnthe Baptist, Piranesi was the son of a mason, blind in one eye,and of Laura Lucchesi. His maternal uncle was an architect andengineer,--for in those days the same person frequently combined thetwo professions,--who had executed various water-works and at leastone church. From his uncle the young Giovanni Battista received hisearliest instruction in things artistic, for which he appears to havedisplayed a conspicuously precocious aptitude. Before he was seventeenhe had attracted sufficient attention to assure him success in hisfathers profession, but Rome had already fired his imagination, andaroused that impetuous determination which marked his entire career.His yearning after Rome report says to have been first aroused by ayoung Roman girl whom he loved, but, however that may be, he overcamethe determined opposition of his parents, and, in 1738, at the age ofeighteen, set out for the papal city to study architecture, engraving,and in general the fine arts; for even in those degenerate days therewere left some traces of that multiform talent which distinguishedthe artists of the Renaissance. When he reached the goal of hislonging, the impression produced by the immortal city on so fervid animagination must have been so deep, so overwhelming, as to annihilateall material considerations, although they could not have been otherthan harassing, since the allowance received from his father wasonly six Spanish piastres a month, or some six or seven lire of theItalian money of to-day. By what expedients he managed to live wecannot even conjecture, but it may be supposed that he was boarded,apprentice-wise, by the masters under whom he studied. These teacherswere Scalfarotto and Valeriani, a noted master of perspective and apupil of one Ricci of Belluno, who had acquired from the great Frenchpainter and lover of Rome, Claude Lorrain, the habit of paintinghighly imaginative pictures composed of elements drawn from the ruinsof the Roman Campagna. This style was transmitted to Piranesi byValeriani, without doubt stimulating that passionate appreciation ofthe melancholy grandeur of ruined Rome already growing in his mind, andafterward to fill his entire life and work.[Illustration: PIRANESI. ARCH OF VESPASIANIn this, as in many of Piranesis compositions, the figures are franklyposing, but their presence adds such charm to the scene that none couldwish them absent.Size of the original etching, 19  27 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. ARCH OF TRAJAN AT BENEVENTO, IN THE KINGDOM OFNAPLESA fine rendering of that air of glory which the most dilapidatedfragments of a Roman Arch of Triumph never lose. The Arch of Trajan,one of the finest of ancient arches, was dedicated A.D. 114. Itis of white marble, 48 feet high and 30 wide, with a single archmeasuring 27 by 16 feet. The arch is profusely sculptured with reliefsillustrating Trajans life and his Dacian triumphs.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches]At the same time, he acquired a thorough knowledge of etching andengraving under the Sicilian, Giuseppe Vasi, whose etchings firstaroused the great Goethes longing for Italy. At the age of twenty,thinking, probably not without foundation, that this master wasconcealing from him the secret of the correct use of acid in etching,Piranesi is reported, in his anger, to have made an attempt to murderVasi. Such an act would not be out of keeping with the characterof the fiery Venetian, for, before leaving Venice, he had alreadybeen described by a fellow-pupil as _stravagante_, extravagant, orfantastic, a term not restricted by Italians to a mans handling ofmoney, but applied rather to character as a whole, in which connectionit usually denotes the less fortunate side of that complete andmagnificent surrender to an overwhelming passion which aroused solively an admiration of the Italian nature in the great French writer,Stendhal. When we, tame moderns, judge the extravagance of suchcharacters, it is only fair to recollect that, with all their faultsand crimes, these same unbridled Italians were capable of heroicvirtues, unknown to our pale and timid age. Men like Cellini andPiranesi, who had much in common, are simply incarnate emotional force,a fact which is, at the same time, the cause of their follies and theindispensable condition of their genius.After this quarrel Piranesi returned to Venice, where he attempted togain a livelihood by the practice of architecture. There is reasonto believe that at this period he studied under Tiepolo; at any ratethere exist in his published works a few curious, rather rococo platesentirely different from his usual manner, and very markedly influencedby the style of Tiepolos etching. He also studied painting with thePolanzani who is responsible for that portrait of him which formsthe frontispiece to the first edition of Le Antichit Romane, andgives so vivid an impression of the dmonic nature of the man. Meetingwith little success in Venice, he went to Naples, after returning toRome, attracted principally by archological interests. He stayed atHerculaneum, Pompeii, and Pstum, where at this time, undoubtedly, hemade the drawings of the temples afterward etched and published by hisson. The drawings for these etchings of Pstum, among the best knownof the Piranesi plates, are now in the Soane Museum in London.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE BASILICA, PSTUMSize of the original etching, 17  26 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE AT PSTUMSize of the original etching, 19  26 inches]Having decided that he had no vocation for painting, which hedefinitely abandoned at this time, Piranesi returned to Rome, andsettled there permanently. His father now wished him to return toVenice, but he was altogether unwilling to do so, and replied,characteristically, that Rome being the seat of all his affectionsit would be impossible for him to live separated from her monuments.He intimated that in preference to leaving, he would give up hisallowance, a suggestion upon which his father acted promptly bystopping all remittances, so that, estranged from his relatives,Piranesi was now entirely dependent upon his own resources for alivelihood.His poverty and suffering at this period were undoubtedly great, buthis indomitable nature could be crippled by no material hardships.He devoted himself entirely to etching and engraving, and, whentwenty-one, published his first composition. At this time he was livingin the Corso opposite the Doria-Pamphili Palace, but even if theneighborhood was illustrious, it is not pleasant to think what wretchedgarret must have hidden the misery of his struggling genius. Hisfirst important and dated work, the Antichit Romane de Tempi dellaRepublica, etc., was published in 1748, with a dedication to the notedantiquary, Monsignore Bottari, chaplain to Pope Benedict XIV. Thiswork was received with great favor, as the first successful attempt toengrave architecture with taste, and from the day of its appearancePiranesi may be said to have been famous. However, he still experiencedthe utmost difficulty in finding the money necessary to subsist and toprocure the materials requisite to his work. Yet, despite his terriblepoverty, his labor was unceasing and tireless to a degree that we cannow scarcely conceive. It must be borne in mind that, in additionto etching and engraving, he was engaged in the extensive study ofarchology, which led him to undertake many remarkable researches. Hebecame a noted archologist of great erudition, as is shown by numerouscontroversies with famous antiquarians of the day. Some idea of thecopiousness of his knowledge can be gained from the fact that hisargument covers a hundred folio pages in that controversy in which heupheld the originality of Roman art against those who claimed it to bea mere offshoot of Grecian genius. In the preface to one of his books,he refers to it as the result of what I have been able to gather fromthe course of many years of indefatigable and most exact observations,excavations, and researches, things which have never been undertaken inthe past. This statement is quite true, and when we realize that thepreparation of a single plate, such as the plan of the Campus Martius,would, in itself, have taken most men many years of work, we can onlyfeel uncomprehending amazement at the capacity for work possessed bythis man of genius.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE TEMPLE OF CONCORDFrom this plate it is possible to gain an idea of the greater beautypossessed by ruined Rome when still shrouded in vegetation. The Arch ofSeptimius Severus is seen in the middle distanceSize of the original etching, 18  27 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. SITE OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN FORUMA very interesting historical document which makes it possible torealize an aspect of the Forum at present difficult to conceiveSize of the original, 14  23 inches]The very spirit of imperial Rome would seem to have filled Piranesi,making him its own, so that the vanished splendor was to him everpresent and added to the strange melancholy of the vine-grown ruinswhich alone remained from the grandeur that was Rome. In every ageand in every province most Italians have been animated by a livelysense of their direct descent from classic Rome,--a feeling that itsfame was peculiarly their inheritance in a way true of no other people,so that this glorious descent was their greatest pride and claim toleadership. In the darkest days of oppression and servitude, when Italysat neglected and disconsolate among her chains, there were neverlacking nobler souls who kept alive a sense of what was fitting in thedescendants of classic Rome, and took therein a melancholy pride. Butno Italian was ever more completely an ancient Roman than Piranesi,who certainly, in despite of his Venetian birth, considered himself aRoman citizen. This sentiment played an important part in, perhaps,the most characteristic act of his whole life, namely, his fantasticmarriage, of which he himself left an account not unworthy of Cellini.He was drawing in the Forum one Sunday, when his attention wasattracted by a boy and girl, who proved to be the children of thegardener to Prince Corsini. The girls type of features instantlyconvinced Piranesi that she was a direct descendant of the ancientRomans, and so aroused his emotions that on the spot he asked if itwere possible for her to marry him. Her exact reply is not recorded,although it must have conveyed the fact that she was free, but it cansurprise no one to hear that the girl was thoroughly frightened bysuch sudden and overpowering determination. His hasty resolution wasconfirmed when Piranesi afterward learned that she had a dower of onehundred and fifty piastres, or some three hundred lire of to-day, afact certain to arouse a keen realization both of his poverty and ofthe value of money in those days. Without any delay, he proceeded toask the girls hand in marriage of her parents, who, like the girl,appear to have been so terrified and overwhelmed by the cyclonic natureof the man as to be incapable of the slightest resistance. Whatever mayhave been the motives of all the parties concerned, the fact is thatPiranesi was married to the descendant of the ancient Romans exactlyfive days after he first laid eyes on her classic features! Immediatelyafter the wedding, having placed side by side his wifes dowry andhis own finished plates, together with his unfinished designs, heinformed his presumably astonished bride that their entire fortune wasnow before them, but that in three years time her portion should bedoubled; which proved to be no boast but a promise that he actuallyfulfilled.According to report, he told his friends that he was marrying inorder to obtain the money required for the completion of his greatbook on Roman Antiquities. However, even if he did marry for money,he maintained all his life, to the poor womans great discomfort, asjealous a watch over his wife as could be expected of the most amorousof husbands; so his affections as well as his vanity may, perhaps,have been called into play by his marriage. At any rate, his ideas asto family life were worthy of the most severe Roman _paterfamilias_.His son, Francesco, born in 1756, relates that, when absorbed inhis studies, he would quite forget the hours for meals, while hisfive children, neither daring to interrupt him nor eat without him,experienced all the miseries of hunger. His domestic coercion anddiscipline were doubtless extreme, but the family would seem to havelived not too unhappily.[Illustration: PIRANESI.

THE ARCH OF TITUSIn this plate can be seen a favorite device of Piranesis, which isto enhance the size and stability of massive architecture by placingon some part of the ruin a human figure in active motion. The Arch ofTitus was built in commemoration of the taking of Jerusalem. The vaultis richly coffered and sculptured, and the interior faces of the piersdisplay reliefs of Titus in triumph, with the plunder of the temple atJerusalem.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches]Every two years, if not oftener, a monumental book would make itsappearance, to say nothing of separate plates, and Piranesi was now afamous man. With the exception of Winckelmann, he did more than anyone to spread a knowledge and love of classic art, while his learningand his researches aroused a widespread appreciation of the nobilityof Roman ruins, thereby largely contributing to their excavationand protection. His exhaustive acquaintance with antiquity and hisimpassioned admiration for its beauty, combined with his singular andinteresting character, caused him to mingle with all that was mostremarkable in the world of arts and letters in Rome, at the same timebringing him into relation with whatever foreigners of distinctionmight visit the city. He was, however, then and always a poor man, forhis first important work, Le Antichit Romane, sold in the completeset for the ridiculous pittance of sixteen paoli, or about seventeenlire, while later the Pope was wont to pay him only a thousand lire foreighteen gigantic volumes of etchings. The very fact that his fertilitywas so enormous, lowered the price it was possible to ask for hisplates during his lifetime, just as since his death it has militatedagainst a correct valuation of his talent. Forty years after he came toRome, he wrote to a correspondent that he had made, on an average, someseven thousand lire of modern money a year, out of which he had had tosupport his family, pay for the materials required in his business, andgather together that collection of antiquities which was a part of hisstock in trade.The rapidity with which Piranesi worked, and the number of plates, allof unusually large dimensions, which he executed, are so extraordinaryas to leave one bewildered by the thought of such incomprehensibleindustry. Competent authorities vary in their statements as to thenumber of plates produced by Piranesi, but accepting as correct thelowest figure, which is thirteen hundred, it will be found that forthirty-nine years he produced, on a rough average, one plate every twoweeks. Ordinarily, great productiveness will be found to have damagedthe quality of the work accomplished, but this is not true in the caseof Piranesi. Although his work is of varying merit, like that of alltrue artists, and even comprises examples lacking his usual excellence,there is no plate which betrays any signs of hurry or carelessworkmanship, while in many the meticulous finish is remarkable. Suchan output is in itself phenomenal, yet in preparation for these workshe found the time to pursue archological researches and studies, inthemselves sufficiently exhaustive to have occupied the life of anordinary man. Moreover, in his capacity of architect, he executedvarious important restorations, including those of the Priorato diMalta, where he is buried, and of Santa Maria del Popolo. Most ofhis restorations were undertaken by command of the Venetian, PopeClement XIII, who bestowed on him the title of Knight, or Cavaliere,a distinction of which he was proud, as he was of his membership inthe Royal Society of Antiquaries in London, of which he was made anhonorary fellow in 1757.[Illustration: PIRANESI.

FAADE OF ST. JOHN LATERANPiranesi, almost without exception, placed a written description of thescene on every one of his plates, using it as a decorative feature.In this case it proves an integral part of a group which makes aninteresting etching out of what otherwise would have been a simplearchitectural drawing.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches]The question of how much assistance Piranesi received in the executionof his plates is an interesting one. In a few prints, the figureswere etched by one Jean Barbault, whose name sometimes appears onthe margins with that of Piranesi. The latters son, Francesco,was taught design and architecture by his father, whose manner hereproduced exactly, although none of the numerous etchings which heleft behind him show any signs of those qualities which constitute thegreatness of his parents work. The daughter, Laura, also etched in themanner of her father and has left some views of Roman monuments. Thesetwo children, together with one of his pupils, Piroli, undoubtedlyaided him, but their moderate skill is a proof that their assistancecould not have been carried very far. That his pupils never formed asort of factory for the production of work passing under their mastersname, as happened with some famous painters, is made certain by thefact that he established no school which caught his manner and producedwork reminiscent or imitative of his. His unparalleled output must,therefore, be almost entirely a result of his own unaided labor.Piranesi died at Rome, surrounded by his family, on the ninth ofNovember, 1778, of a slight disorder rendered serious by neglect. Hisbody was first buried in the church of St. Andrea della Fratte, but wassoon afterward removed to that Priory of Santa Maria Aventina whichhe had himself restored. Here his family erected a statue of him,carved by one Angelini after the design of Piranesis pupil, Piroli.Baron Stolberg writes in his Travels: Here is a fine statue of thearchitect Piranesi, as large as life, placed there by his son. It isthe work of a living sculptor, Angelini, and though it certainly cannotbe compared with the best antiquities, it still possesses real merit.The singular figure of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, with his power, hisfire, and his passionate love of Roman grandeur, not unworthy of somegreat period of rebirth, appears all the more phenomenal when viewedin relation to his times and his surroundings. The corruption of thepontifical city had been flagrant since the days when it filled withscorn and loathing the wonderful Regrets penned by the exiled Frenchpoet, Joachim du Bellay, whose homesick heart took less pleasure in thehard marble and audacious fronts of Roman palaces than in the delicateslate of the distant dwelling built by his Angevin ancestors,--butits depravity had at least been replete with virility and splendor.After the Council of Trent, however, the Counter-Reformation spreadover the Roman prelacy a wave of external reform, which left the innerrottenness untouched, but veiled it decently with all the stifling andpetty vices of hypocrisy, until Roman life gradually grew to be thatcurious androgynous existence which we see reflected so clearly inCasanovas memoirs. During the eighteenth century, when Piranesi lived,the whole of Italy had sunk to depths of degradation such as few greatraces have ever known, not because the people were hopelessly decayed,for their great spirit never died, but lived to flame forth in 1848and create that marvelous present-day regeneration of Italy, which isperhaps the most astonishing example of the rebirth of a once greatbut apparently dead nation that the world has yet seen. The debasedcondition of Italy at that time was caused, rather, by centuries ofpriestly and foreign oppression, which had stifled the entire countryuntil it had fallen into a state of torpor little different todeath. Any sign of intellectual or political activity, however slightor innocent, had long been ruthlessly repressed by Austria and thepetty tyrants who ruled the states of Italy. Since men must findsome occupation to fill their lives, or else go mad, in a land whereevery noble and even normal employment was forbidden, the Italian ofthe day was forced to confine himself within the limits of an idleinanity, concerned only with petty questions and petty interests. It isdifficult for people of to-day to conceive the abject futility to whichsuch oppression and enforced inactivity can reduce an entire nation.In France the comparative freedom enjoyed under the old rgime gave tothe eighteenth century, in its most frivolous and futile moments, acharming grace utterly denied to enslaved and priest-ridden Italy. Torealize the situation, it is only necessary to consider for a momentthe institution of the cicisbeo, and to read Parinis Il Giorno.In this world of little loveless lovers, of sonneteers and collectoracademicians, the figure of Piranesi looms gigantic, like a creatureof another world. He had a purity of taste in artistic matters quiteunknown to his contemporaries, while his originality, his passion, andhis vigor seem indeed those of some antique Roman suddenly come to lifeto serve as pattern for a people fallen on dire days.[Illustration: PIRANESI.

The dome is practically solidconcrete.Size of the original etching, 18  22 inches]Francesco Piranesi, after the death of his father, sold the collectionformed by him to Gustavus III of Sweden in return for an annuity. Hecontinued the publication of etchings, many, although unacknowledged,from drawings by his father, and was assisted in his archologicalresearch by Pope Pius VI. After various rather dishonorabletransactions, as spy to the court of Sweden, he started for Paris bysea in 1798, having with him the plates of his fathers etchings,and accompanied in all probability by his sister Laura. The ship onwhich he traveled was captured and all it contained taken as a prizeby a British man-of-war, England and France being then engaged inhostilities. By some curious chance, the English admiral knew theworth of Piranesis work, and persuaded the officers who had made thecapture to restore the plates to his son, and in addition obtained, bysome still more curious chance, both the admission of the plates intoFrench territory free of duty, and government protection of Francescosownership. At Paris, Francesco Piranesi and his brother, Pietro, triedto found both an academy and a manufactory of terra-cotta. He alsorepublished his fathers etchings and his own, thus creating the firstFrench edition, already inferior in quality to the original Romanimpressions. He died in Paris, in 1810, in straitened circumstances.The plates of both the fathers and the sons work passed into thehands of the publishers Firmin-Didot, who republished them once more.The original plates, which at one time were rented for almost nothingto any one who wished them for a days printing, finally found arefuge, as before said, in the Royal Calcography at Rome, where theyhave been coated with steel and rebitten, so that it is now possible toprint as many copies every year as tourists and architects may desire.It can, therefore, be seen that, most unfortunately, the world isflooded with countless impressions which, even if they have value foran architect as documents, or still retain enough character to givethem some merit as pictures, are yet so utterly changed and debased asto do the gravest and most irreparable injustice to the reputation ofthe genius who created them.[Illustration: PIRANESI.

INTERIOR OF THE VILLA OF MCENAS, AT TIVOLIAn example of Piranesis skill in making a rather ordinary scene appeardramatic, and arousing a sense of vastness greater than that impartedby the actual buildingSize of the original etching, 16  23 inches]PART IILE CARCERI DINVENZIONE (THE PRISONS)Any one who bestows even a passing inspection on the etchings ofPiranesi will be struck by the intensity of imagination which theydisplay, a quality whose precise nature it will perhaps be useful toanalyze, since, despite the fact that we use the word constantly, thethousand differing values which we attach to it render our ideas ofits true meaning in general of the vaguest. Reduced to its ultimateessence, imagination would appear to be the faculty of picture-making;that is to say, the power of bringing images before the mental eyewith absolute exactitude, and of clothing ideas with a definite form,so that they have a reality quite as great as that which characterizesthe objects of the external world. So long as ideas remain in the mindin the form of abstract conceptions, they are food for reason, buthave no power to move us. It is only when, by means of the imaginativefaculty, the concept has presented itself as a definite image, thatit arouses our emotions and becomes a motive of conduct. When, forexample, the idea of an injury to some one we love comes into oursphere of consciousness, a concrete picture of that injury presentsitself in some form or other to our inner vision, and is the cause ofthe emotion which we experience. Our sympathy and understanding will beproportionate to the varying distinctness with which our imaginativepower offers such images for our contemplation. Imagination thereforeconnotes the ability to conceive the emotions and experiences ofothers, and is thus indissolubly connected with sympathy and all thenobler qualities of human nature.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO, NEAR TIVOLISize of the original etching, 18  24 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE FALLS AT TIVOLIThis etching illustrates a little known side of Piranesis talent,namely, his ability to etch pure landscapeThe Falls of the Teverone (the ancient Anio) at Tivoli are fifteenmiles east-northeast of Rome. Tivoli was the favorite place ofresidence of many Romans--Mcenas, Augustus, Hadrian--and the ruins ofboth Hadrians Villa and the Villa of Mcenas are still to be seen.Size of the original etching, 18  28 inches]The fact that our conduct is determined not by concepts, but by mentalimages which motive emotion, although at first it appear paradoxical,will certainly be recognized by any one who is willing to study,if only for a short time, his own mental experiences. This truthwas realized with such force as to be made the base of their entirespiritual discipline by that notable Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, andhis followers, the Jesuit fathers, who have understood the complex andsubtle mechanism of the human soul more profoundly and exhaustivelythan any other body of men which has ever existed. In classic timesHorace was cognizant of this peculiarity of mans mind when he wrotethat the emotions are aroused more slowly by objects which arepresented to consciousness by hearing than by those made known bysight. Burke, it is true, disputes this dictum of the Latin poet, onthe ground that, among the arts, poetry certainly arouses emotions moreintense than those derived from painting. Although this is probablytrue, for reasons which he details and which it would be wearisome toreiterate here, it is certain that poetry moves us exactly in ratio tothe power it possesses of creating vivid images for our contemplation,while it is certainly doubtful whether any emotion excited throughhearing surpasses in vivacity that experienced on suddenly seeingcertain objects or situations.All artists at all worthy of the name are, therefore, possessed to acertain degree of imagination. It is the gift which makes visible tothem whatever they embody in words, pictures, sounds, or sculpture.If totally deprived of it, they could create nothing, for no man canexpress what does not appear to him as having a real existence for atleast the moment of creation. In the domain of art, imagination, inits lower forms, is merely the power of recollecting and reproducingthings endowed with material existence; but in its highest development,when handling the conceptions and emotions of an original mind, itacquires the power of actual creation, and is inseparably attached tothe loftiest acts of which man is capable.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE FALLS AT TIVOLIAmong later works there are few better expressions of that feeling fornature in its wildest aspects, which, practically unknown until thetime of Rousseau, is now considered the speciality of modern artists.That Piranesi appreciated this side of nature, and was able to expressits poetry and power, could be proved by this plate alone.Size of the original etching, 18  28 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. ST. PETERS AND THE VATICANThis is perhaps the best example of Piranesis exaggerated perspective.It is quite justified, in this case at least, by the success withwhich it creates an impression of vastness and of grandeur which wascertainly aimed at by the architects of St. Peters, but which theexterior of the actual building, quite as certainly, fails to arouse.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches]Every plate etched by Piranesi betrays to even a careless glance thepresence of imagination in some form, while in one series this noblefaculty is revealed with an amplitude almost unparalleled. If itbe only the presentment of fragments of Roman epitaphs, he finds away by some play of light or shade, or by some trick of picturesquearrangement, to throw a certain interest about them, relieving thedryness of barren facts; if it be the etching of some sepulchralvault, in itself devoid of any but antiquarian interest, he introducessome human figure or some suggestive implement to give a flash ofimagination to the scene. In those very plates where he depicts theactually existing monuments of classic Rome, and in which it was hisexpressed intention to save these august ruins from further injuryand preserve them forever in his engravings, he created what he sawanew, and voiced his own distinctive sentiment of the melancholygrandeur of ruined Rome. To-day the word _impressionism_ has come tohave a rather restricted meaning in connection with a recent school ofart, but Piranesis work, like that of all really great artists,is in the true sense of the word _impressionistic_. In passing, itmay be remarked that he was one of the rare artists in earlier timeswho worked directly from nature, a habit distinctive of our modernimpressionism. Piranesi is concerned with the expression of his ownpeculiar impression of what he sees; for the benefit of others andfor his own delight he gives form to his own particular vision ofwhatever he treats. He certainly was desirous of, and successful in,recording the existing forms of the buildings he loved so well; it isalso true that his etchings and engravings are in many ways faithfulrenderings which have immense historical and antiquarian value, sincethey preserve an aspect of Rome none shall ever see again, but togetherwith the actual facts, and transcending them, he offers the imaginativepresentment of his own creative emotion. What he draws is based onnature, and is full of verisimilitude, but it is not realistic in thebase way that a photograph would be. It contains while it surpassesreality, and is faithful to the _idea_ of what he sees, using that wordin its Platonic sense.Taine, in what is probably the most lucid and exhaustive definitionof the nature of a work of art ever given, starts from the statementthat all great art is based on an exact imitation of nature; thenproceeds to demonstrate how this imitation of nature must not extendto every detail, but should, instead, confine itself to the relationsand mutual dependencies of the parts; and finally states, as thecondition essential to creating a work of art, that the artist shallsucceed, by intentional and systematic variation of these relations,in setting free, in expressing more clearly and completely than in thereal object, some essential characteristic or predominating idea. Thisis wherein art transcends nature, and a work of art is, therefore,constituted by the fact that it expresses the essential idea of someseries of subjects, freed from the accidents of individuality, ina form more harmoniously entire than that attained by any objectin nature. Now this is precisely what Piranesi did. He is oftentaken to task for his departure from a literal statement of factin his renderings of architectural subjects, but, in so departing,he is varying the interrelation of parts so as to disengage thecharacteristic essence of what he depicts, and thus create a work ofart, not a historical document. If he lengthens Berninis colonnadein front of St. Peters, he is only composing with the same libertyaccorded to Turner, when, in one picture of St. Germain, he introduceselements gathered from three separate parts of the river Seine; and byso doing he expresses the idea of limitless grandeur, latent in St.Peters, with a fullness it does not possess in the actual building. Inhis Antiquities of Rome, he disengages a sense of devastation and ofdesolate majesty which is the fundamental characteristic of Roman ruin,and one that could have presented itself with such directness and forceonly to the mind of an artist of genius. His own vision of the innertruth of what he saw, stripped of everything accidental, is what hegives to posterity, and what lifts his work out of the field of simplearchology into the proud realm of true art.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE VILLA DESTE AT TIVOLIIt is interesting to note that at the time Piranesi etched this fineplate the avenue of Cypress trees, which now adds so much to thepicturesqueness of the Villa dEste, was not even planted.Size of the original etching, 18  27 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI.

(Rome, 1750.)Size of the original etching, 21  16 inches]Even in those plates where he etches actual scenes with lovingcare, Piranesi passes nature, as it were, through the alembicof his own personality, doing this moreover in a way peculiar tohim and to him alone. His originality consists in this,--that hismind, when considering an object, seized instinctively on certaindistinguishing features peculiar to that object, qualities which hismind, and only his, was capable of extracting from the rough ore ofordinary perception; and that for the powerful impression which hethus experienced, he was able to find an adequate and distinctiveexpression. It was his good fortune to behold Rome in a moment ofpathetic and singular beauty, irrevocably vanished, as one of thepenalties to be paid for the knowledge gained by modern excavation.In those days the Roman ruins did not have that trim air, as ofskeletons ranged in a museum, which they have taken on under ourtireless cleansing and research. For centuries the barbarians of Romehad observed the precept: Go ye upon her walls and destroy; butmake not a full end, so that only the uppermost fragments of templecolumns protruded through the earth where the cattle browsed stragglingshrubbery above the buried Forum, while goats and swine herded amongcabins in the filth and century-high dirt which covered the streetsthat had been trod by the pride of emperors. But that which, more thananything else, helped to create an atmosphere of romantic beauty noneshall see again, was the indescribable tangle of vine, shrub, andflower, which in those days draped and hid under a mass of verdure themighty ruins of baths and halls that still stupefy by their vastnesswhen we see them now, devoid of their ancient marble dressing, strippedclean like polished bones. Shelley tells how even in his day theBaths of Caracalla were covered with flowery glades, and thicketsof odoriferous blossoming trees, which are extended in ever-windinglabyrinths.The sentiment of august grandeur inspired by the indestructible massof Roman ruins was, therefore, in those days curiously complicated bythe contrast between them and the fantastic growth of ever-passing,ever-renewed vegetation which wrapped them as in a mantle. Thepoignancy of this beauty Piranesi seized with a felicity and expressedwith a plenitude given to no one but to him. He was, both by natureand by volition, profoundly classical, yet he enveloped all that hehandled, however classic it might be in subject, with a sense ofmysterious strangeness so strong as to arouse the sensation called inlater times _romantic_. This contrast is one of the distinctive phasesof his originality.It would be pleasant to think that Edmund Burke was familiar with thecreations of Giambattista Piranesi when he wrote so searchingly ofThe Sublime and Beautiful; but, if this be perhaps an idle fancy, itis certainly true that it would not be easy to find concrete examplesdemonstrating more clearly than the etchings of Piranesi the truthof large parts of his enquiry, and in particular of the followingdefinition of the sublime: Whatever is fitted in any sort to excitethe ideas of pain and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sortterrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in amanner analogous to terror, is a source of the _sublime_; that is,it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capableof feeling. When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapableof giving any delight, and are simply terrible, but at certaindistances, and with certain modifications, they may be, and they are,delightful, as we every day experience.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE IIISize of the original etching, 21  16 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE IVSize of the original etching, 21  16 inches]The application of these words to the work of Piranesi will probablysurprise those persons acquainted only with his etchings of classicruins. However, even these plates exemplify this definition in manyways which it would be tedious to enumerate, while to feel its fullappositeness it is only necessary to study Piranesis least-known andgreatest achievement, commonly called The Prisons, and known inItalian as Le Carceri dInvenzione. These sixteen fantasies, executedat the age of twenty-two and published at thirty, form a set of printsin which it is no exaggeration to say that imagination is displayedwith a power and amplitude that have elsewhere never been surpassed inetching or engraving, and only rarely in other forms of pictorial art.Although scarcely known to the public at large, they have always formedthe delight of those who feel the appeal of imaginative fantasy, andnotably of Coleridge and of De Quincey, who has recorded his impressionin golden words. They are reputed to represent scenes which burnedthemselves into the artists consciousness while delirious with fever,and it is certain that they do possess that terrible, vivid reality, soenormously amplified as to lose the proportions of ordinary existence,which characterizes all oppressive dreams and particularly thoseinduced by narcotics. They represent interiors of vast and fantasticarchitecture, complete yet unfinished, composed of an inexplicablecomplexity of enormous arches springing from massive piers built,like the arches they carry, of gigantic blocks left rough-hewn. By acontrast that could only have been conceived by genius these monstrousspaces are traversed in every direction by frail scaffoldings, togetherwith ladders, bridges, and all manner of works in wood; and are filled,at the same time, with an inexhaustible succession of ropes, pulleys,and engines, finely described by De Quincey as expressive of enormouspower put forth or of resistance overcome. They are distinguished byone of Piranesis greatest qualities, the power to express immensityas, perhaps, no one else has ever done, and are flooded with lightwhich seems intense in its opposition to the brilliant shadows, sothat altogether it would be difficult to understand their title ofPrisons, were it not for the presence of engines of torment, andof mighty chains that twine over and depend from huge beams, orsometimes bind fast the little bodies of human beings. The unusualand inexplicable nature of these Prisons gives to the beholdersimagination a mighty stimulus productive of strange excitement.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE VSize of the original etching, 21  16 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE VISize of the original etching, 21  15 inches]The English Opium-Eater in likening his visions to thesepictures,--and what higher praise of their imaginative forcecould there be?--speaks of their power of endless growth andself-reproduction. One of their distinguishing peculiarities isthis repetition of parts, as of things which grow out of themselvesunceasingly, reproducing their parts until the brain reels at the ideaof their endlessness. This characteristic, together with that curiousopposition between their air of open immensity and their suggestionof prison-horror, gives them that particular appearance of absolutereality in the midst of impossibility, which is a distinctivefeature of dreams. In this way they arouse a sense of infinitude in themind of the beholder; now, although size is in itself of no importance,it is nevertheless true that, when combined with other qualities ofvalue, greatness of dimension is a powerful cause of the sublime.This greatness, both in conception and in material execution, theypossess, together with that opposition of light to obscurity whichseems in general to be necessary to make anything very terrible.Indeed, that these etchings reveal a more imaginative vigor arousea kind of awe in any one who gives them more than a passing glance,while the horror which they suggest is never physical so as to nauseateor press too nearly and cause pain, but imparts, on the contrary,a sense of danger and of terror that causes a delightful excitement,certainly fulfilling the definition of the sublime as given by Burke.Although it does not follow that Piranesi is a greater etcher thanRembrandt, it may still be true that these etchings reveal a moreimaginative vigor than is shown in those of the great Dutchman. Theydo not possess that subtle imagination which envelops everything thatRembrandt ever touched in an air of exquisite mystery, and gives tohis least sketch an inexhaustible fund of suggestion, nor can theybe compared to his etchings as consummate works of art; yet they dohave a titanic, irresistible force of sheer imagination, which neitherRembrandt nor any other etcher, however superior in other ways,possessed to the same extent. Their preminence in this one point iscertainly admissible, and as it has been shown, presumably, that theyare imaginative, original, and sublime, is it too much to say that,at least in the expression of certain intellectual qualities, Piranesiin these plates carried the art of etching to the highest point yetattained, so that no one who does not know these plates can know quiteall that etching is capable of expressing?The Prisons are also the most notable example of that principle ofopposition, or contrast, of which Piranesi made so masterful a use inwhatever he did. The application of this law in the handling, and attimes in the abuse, of blacks and whites, is, of course, apparent toeven the most casual observer in all that came from his hand. In thepresent series, however, this law may be seen carried to its utmostlimit. From every stupendous vault there hangs a long, thin rope, whileup gigantic pillars of rough masonry climb frail ladders of wood,and great voids between immense piers are spanned by light bridges,also of wood, bearing the slightest and most open of iron railings.In his plates of Roman ruins, Piranesi introduces the human figuredressed in the lovely costume of the eighteenth century, in order tocontrast grace with force, and to oppose the living and the fugitiveto the inanimate and the enduring; but here his use of the humanfigure rises to the truly dramatic. In the midst of these vast andawful halls with their air of stillness and of power, of resistanceovercome, he places men who seem the smallest and the frailest amongcreatures. Grouped by twos or threes, whether depicted in violentmotion or standing with significant gesture, they are always enigmaticin their attitudes, so that their presence and obvious emotion amidthis immense and silent grandeur arouse a sense of tragic action,a feeling of mysterious wonder and curiosity that gives to all loversof intellectual excitement a pleasure as keen as unusual. Particularlyin one vision of a monstrous wheel of wood revolving in space, no oneknows how, above a fragment of rocky architecture, while three humanbeings engaged in animated converse are obviously unconscious of thegigantic revolutions, the limits of fantasy are reached, and the mindturns instinctively to those images of the spheres rolling eternally ininfinite space which are found in Milton and all mystic poets.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE IXSize of the original etching, 21  16 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE VIISize of the original etching, 21  16 inches]These plates are also interesting as a striking and curious proof ofPiranesis conscious mastery of his art. They are filled with such afury of imagination, and are etched with such dash and boldness ofexecution that it seems as though they must be, if not, as was oncesaid, the sane work of a madman, at least burned directly on the plateby the force of a fever-stricken mind. But not so; they are, howeverfevered their original inspiration may have been, the result of carefulelaboration, and are but one more proof of the saying of that otherand still greater etcher, Whistler, that a work of art is complete,and only complete, when all traces have disappeared of the means bywhich it was created. There exists in the British Museum a unique, anduntil recently unknown, series of first states of The Prisons. Now,although these first states have the main outline and, as it were, thegerm of the published states, these latter are so elaborated and, onthe whole, improved, as to make it at first incredible that they couldever have grown out of, or had any relation to, the earlier states. Theidea of vast masses of masonry is there, thrown on the paper with asimplicity of decorative effect and a directness of touch which havebeen lessened in the later work; but, on the other hand, all thosescaffolds, engines of torment, and groups of men above described,are lacking, so that the power of contrast and the sense of terror,productive of the sublime, are entirely wanting, and are, therefore,shown to be the result of conscious art used by Piranesi in elaborationof an original inspiration.Piranesi possessed a style so intensely individual that every printhe produced is recognizable as his by any person who has ever lookedat two or three of his plates with moderate attention, yet this stylenever degenerated into _manner_; that is to say, into an imitationnot of nature, but of the peculiarities of other men or of ones ownearlier work. It became a manner or process in the hands of his son,Francesco, but with Giovanni Battista it always remained _style_, whichis the expression of an original intellect observing nature beforeconsciously varying the relations of elements drawn by it from nature,to the end of producing a work of art. This style, whose faults liein excessive contrasts of black and white, in inadequate handling ofskies, and, at times, in a certain general hardness of aspect, ismarked by great boldness, breadth, and power, both in conception andin actual execution, but it is never marred by crudity or roughness.It is a remarkable fact that the immense force, which first of allimpresses one in Piranesis work, does not exclude, but is, on thecontrary, often combined or contrasted with extreme elegance andfineness of touch. To cite but one instance: in that wonderful printwhich forms the title-page of The Prisons,--the figure of the chainedman, who imparts such a sense of terror to the whole scene, is handledwith a grace and delicacy worthy of Moreau or any of those Frenchcontemporaries who filled the land with their exquisite creations forthe endless delight of later generations. It is this contrast, togetherwith his dramatic introduction and grouping of the human figure, whichgives to Piranesis style a character that has been aptly qualified as_scenic_. An etching by Piranesi produces very much the same curiouseffect that a person experiences on entering a theater after thecurtain has risen, so that he receives from the stage a sudden, sharpimpression, not of a passing moment of the play, but of one distinct,dramatic picture. His etchings are never theatrical in the sense ofsomething factitious and exaggerated beyond likeness to nature, but arealways truly dramatic.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE VIIISize of the original etching, 21  15 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE XISize of the original etching, 16  21 inches]It will have been noticed that plates by Piranesi have been referred toboth as etchings and engravings; this is because he used both etchingand engraving in the same plate, a proceeding which, if decried bytheoretical writers, has none the less been habitually employed bymany of the greatest masters of both means of expression. Despite hisfaults and his Latin exuberance, Piranesi is technically one of thegreat etchers, in whose hands, particularly in certain plates in ThePrisons, the etching-needle attained a breadth of vigorous executionthat no one has surpassed. In judging an artist, the obvious precept,to consider what he was aiming to do, is unfortunately too oftenneglected. To expect of Piranesi either the incomparable delicacy ofWhistler, or the unsurpassed crispness of Meryon would be futile, buthe does possess certain forceful qualities which are not theirs. Whenhe used the burin, he could handle it with the greatest precision andskill. In such a plate as the one known as _The French Academy_, thebuilding is engraved with a skill not at all unworthy of the engraverswho were at that time doing such wonderful work in France, while theplate, as a whole, gains a delightful quality,--that neither pureetching nor pure engraving could have given,--from the contrast whichthe sharp and delicately engraved lines make with the figures that areetched with a consummate freedom and dash worthy of Callot, who, onecannot but think, must have influenced Piranesi.In his valuable monograph on Piranesi, Mr. Arthur Samuel makes thestatement that architectural etching has culminated with him; and itis certain that in this field his work surpasses, both in architecturalcorrectness and in artistic merit, any that has been done either beforeor since his day.[Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE XIIISize of the original etching, 16  21 inches][Illustration: PIRANESI. THE PRISONS. PLATE XIVSize of the original etching, 16  21 inches]PART IIITHE INFLUENCE OF PIRANESI ON DECORATION IN THE XVIII CENTURYThere is still another side of Piranesis originality, publicignorance of which may be said to be complete--namely, his relation toarchitecture, and the very great debt owed him by that art. That hewas an architect who signed himself as such on many plates during hisentire life is a fact ignored even by many of those architects who aremost indebted to him; but this fact is negligible, together with thework which he actually executed as an architect. The benefits which heconferred were rendered in other ways.His first, and perhaps greatest, service consisted in the collectionof materials. The classic motives which he gathered and etched form aninexhaustible store of ornament on which generation after generationof architects has drawn, and will continue to draw. The enormousquantity and variety of classic fragments of the best quality thatPiranesi brought together is in itself astounding, but a fact of stillgreater importance is that it was he who, more than any one else, gavethese motives currency. In his day no one, except Winckelmann--nowknown chiefly by his influence on Goethe, and by his tragic death--didas much as Piranesi to foster appreciation and spread knowledge ofclassic antiquity; while his plates, both by their greater currencyand higher artistic merit, did wider and more enduring good than couldever be accomplished by the work of a critic and connoisseur, evenof Winckelmanns talent and prestige. His boundless enthusiasm andhis real learning aroused more people than we shall ever know, atthe same time that his labors, so indefatigable as to be incredible,spread abroad in prodigal profusion the reproductions of the remainsof classic buildings, statues, and ornament. The greater part of theserelics would have continued, but for him, to be known to only a fewcollectors and frequenters of museums; and it is certain that moreclassic motives have come into use, directly or indirectly, from theworks of Piranesi than from any other one source, with the possibleexception of modern photography.In this connection it is impossible to insist too much on his exquisitetaste, which, although it had its lapses, as in his designs forchimney-pieces, was on the whole of the highest. This fact seemsquite incredible if the time and place of his life be considered.The intellectual degradation of all Italy at this period has alreadybeen alluded to, and, art being always a reflection and expressionof contemporary life, it follows that the artistic degradation ofPiranesis Italian contemporaries was complete. It is difficult toconceive the rococo horrors of eighteenth-century Italy. In Francethe most contorted productions of the Louis XV style, or the mostfar-fetched symbolic lucubrations under Louis XVI, never reached suchdepths of bad taste; for the French, in their most unfortunate moments,can never divest themselves entirely of an innate taste and a sense ofmeasure which give some redeeming grace to their worst follies. Thelack of tact, of a sense of limitations, which often characterizesSpanish and Italian art, and at times makes possible splendid flightsnever attempted by the French, also permits them, when misguided, tosink to abysmal depths. It would be hard to find much good in the heavycontortions of the rococo work of eighteenth-century Italy, which,starting from Bernini, exaggerated all his faults and kept none of evenhis perverted genius. Amid this riot of bad taste, Piranesi, with hislove of classic simplicity, his sense of the noble, and his feeling forbalance and distance, stands out an inexplicable phenomenon.In certain plates, Piranesi, while using elements taken from antiquity,created a style of ornamental composition which inspired or was copiedin work praised for its originality, and passing under the name ofother styles. No one dreams of speaking of a Piranesi style, yet thereis many a piece of decoration that calls itself Louis XVI, or Adam, oranything else, which comes directly from the work of this much-pilferedItalian. He stands in relation to a great deal of architecturaldecoration much as do, in science, those profound and creative mindswho discover a great principle, but neglect its detailed application,only to have it taken up by lesser inventors of a practical trend, whoput it to actual uses, the tangible value of which excites so great anadmiration that no thought is taken of the man who discovered the veryprinciple at the base of it all. In such plates as those dedicated toRobert Adam and Pope Clement XIII there can be found, fully developed,the style we call currently Louis XVI, although the greater part ofit was produced under Louis XV contemporaneously with the work whichgoes by that name. The style in question is there, with its exquisitedetail copied from the antique; we can see its inspiration taken fromthe classic which it wished to reproduce, together with its fortunateinability to do so, and its consequently successful creation ofsomething entirely original but yet filled with classic spirit. Thatinterruption of ornament, that alternation of the decorated and theplain, that sense of balance and of contrast, distinctive of the LouisXVI style--all are here. To think that these qualities came to Piranesithrough French influence would be ridiculous, for the style underdiscussion obviously took for its model classic art, to which it was anattempted return; and as Piranesi was all his life in direct contactwith the source of this inspiration, he could scarcely have been formedby a derivation of that which he knew directly.If this be true, it may be asked why Piranesis work did not create inItaly at least sporadic attempts at a style analogous to that of LouisXVI. The reason for this lies in the already mentioned condition ofthe Italy of that day, for a work of art is absolutely conditioned by,and a result of, the environment in which it occurs. Here and there awork of art may, by some phenomenon, occur in opposition, or withoutapparent relation, to its surroundings; but in such circumstancesit will have no successors, just as an unusually hardy orange-treemay thrive far to the north, but will not bear fruit and propagateitself. A great critic has said: There is a reigning direction, whichis that of the century; those talents who try to grow in an oppositedirection find the issue closed; the pressure of public spirit and ofsurrounding manners compresses or turns them aside by imposing on thema fixed flowering. The torpor and bad taste engendered in Italy bypolitical and intellectual oppression precluded the work of Piranesifrom bearing any fruit in his own country.[Illustration: Statue of Piranesi, by Angelini, assisted by Piranesisson, and erected in the Church of Santa Maria in Aventino (Rome).

Riccardo Hayward Scuttore Inglese.Size of the original etching, 24  16 inches]To think, on the other hand, that Piranesi exerted an influence onFrench art of his day is not so fanciful as might at first be supposed.If it be true, as just stated, that it is impossible for the work ofan artist to produce any result when his environment is hostile, itis equally true that an artist, or a body of artists, can exert anenormous influence when their surroundings favor and the ground isready to receive the seed they sow. France was ripe for such seed asPiranesi cast abroad vainly in Italy, and in the former country anincalculable influence in the creation of the Louis XVI style wasexerted by those men who accompanied Mme. de Pompadours brother, AbelPoisson, Marquis de Marigny, on his travels in Italy. Three yearspreviously this great patron of art had caused her brother to beappointed to the succession of the Surintendance des Beaux-Arts, andafter three years of apprenticeship, in order to make himself worthyof this important and exalted position, she sent him, in the companyof a numerous suite, to Italy in December, 1749, to complete hiseducation by remaining there until September, 1751. In his followingwere Soufflot, the architect, and Charles Nicholas Cochin _fils_, thecelebrated engraver. On his return from Italy, M. de Marigny directedall the works of art undertaken by the government throughout France,while Soufflot built the church of Ste. Genevive, now known as thePanthon, and was one of the most conspicuous and influential men inthe world of art in his day. Cochin, aside from being a great engraver,was intellectually one of the most interesting artists of the day,and, as M. de Marignys right-hand man, wielded an influence almostincomprehensible to us of to-day. The latter part of his life, hereally ruled in M. de Marignys stead, and his absolute dictatorship inall matters of art in France can only be compared to that of Le Brununder Louis XIV.That his Italian travels were the decisive influence of Cochinscareer is clearly shown in his own work, and is expressly statedby Diderot, who says of him that, judge everywhere else, he was ascholar at Rome. Soufflot was only seven years older than Piranesi,and Cochin but five. Now, when these distinguished Frenchmen were inRome, Piranesi was already famous and frequented the most interestingartistic circles. His talents and his remarkably impetuous personalitymade him one of the curiosities of Rome, so that it is scarcelycredible that these visiting foreigners should not have seen much ofhim. As their express object was the study of antiquity, and as no onein Rome knew more of the ruins or had so lively an enthusiasm for themas Piranesi, it is certainly probable that he influenced them deeply.[Illustration: SECTION OF ONE OF THE SIDES OF THE GREAT ROOM, ORLIBRARY, OF EARL MANSFIELDS VILLA AT KENWOODRobert Adam, Architect, 1767.

Engraved by PiranesiFrom The Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam. (London,1778)]Aside from these men, the list is long of famous Frenchmen who studiedin Rome during the height of Piranesis artistic production, and mustcertainly have felt his influence. It includes Augustin Pajou, thesculptor, who went to the Villa Mdicis as Prix de Rome in 1748, ateighteen, and who afterward decorated the opera built at Versailles byAnge Gabriel, architect of the faultless buildings which ennoble thePlace de la Concorde; Jean Jacques Caffieri, the sculptor, who was inRome from 1749 to 1753; Chalgrin, Prix de Rome in 1758, successorto Soufflot as architect of the city of Paris, and architect of St.Philippe du Roule and of the Arc de Triomphe; Jean Antoine Houdon,the sculptor, Prix de Rome in 1761, at twenty, who came to Americawith Franklin to execute the statue of Washington now in Richmond;and finally Claude Franois Michel, known as Clodion, who gained thePrix de Rome for sculpture in 1763 and filled whatever he touchedwith unrivaled grace, raising the art of terra-cotta figurines to adegree of loveliness no one else ever attained. It must be rememberedthat these architects and sculptors did not confine themselves toarchitecture pure and simple, as do our prouder and less talentedcontemporaries. With the spirit which animates all periods of greatart, they considered no object too insignificant to be made lovely bytheir talent. They decorated theaters and houses, designing furniture,clocks, vases, and every article of daily life; filling them all withthe consummate, delicate art that remains the despair of all whohave followed. If, therefore, as is to be supposed, they underwentPiranesis influence while in Rome, it would have made itself felt,through them, in all the decorative arts of France.If Piranesis influence in France be a subject for hypothesis, inEngland it can be decisively proved in the case of the so-calledAdam style, a vulgar caricature of which is at present so prevalentin New York. Robert Adam, a Scotchman who studied in Rome, was sodelightfully original and adventurous as to fit out an expeditionto explore the then totally unknown Palace of Diocletian at Spalatoin Dalmatia. He was also a friend of Piranesi, who dedicated hisviews of the Campus Martius to Robert Adam, a British cultivatorof architecture, as a proof of his affection. Now Adam, a man ofunusually alert mind and delicate taste, was a poor architect, with amost defective sense of proportion in the composition of a buildingas a whole, who nevertheless possessed unusual and distinctive talentas a decorator. His fine taste led him to cover his work with detailexecuted and often conceived by remarkable persons, so that much ofthe credit for originality and delicacy given to him is due, as withso many an architect, to the artists whom he had the cleverness andgood fortune to employ and the ability to direct. In the preparationof his monumental book he was assisted by Eques J. B. Piranesi, ashe there signs himself, who actually engraved three plates with hisown hand, while the rendering of every design in the book shows hisinfluence. Knowing this, it is impossible to doubt that Adams tasteand style were profoundly influenced by, and indebted to, so originaland masterly a mind as that of Piranesi.A comparison of Adams book with certain plates by Piranesi willclearly show the debt, while a careful study of only three of hiscompositions--namely, the title-page before mentioned as dedicatedto Adam and the two plates inscribed with the name of Pope ClementXIII--will in itself make clear that much decorative work called eitherLouis XVI or Adam takes its forms as well as its inspiration directlyfrom the creations of Giambattista Piranesi. Piranesis influence canalso be proved in the case of George Dance, architect of old NewgatePrison; of Robert Mylne, architect of old Blackfriars Bridge; of SirJohn Soane, architect of the Bank of England; and of many more. Thesubject of Piranesis influence in England has been so exhaustivelytreated by Mr. Arthur Samuels in his monograph as to make useless anyattempt to rehandle the subject here.[Illustration: PIRANESI.

UPPER LEFT-HAND PORTION, BEARING A DEDICATIONTO ROBERT ADAM, OF PIRANESIS ETCHED PLAN OF THE CAMPUS MARTIUSSize of the original etching (of which the above is a part only), 53 45 inches]Still another example of Piranesis influence is to be found in thesketches of the present-day German, Otto Rieth, the originalityof whose drawings is so vaunted. Very talented and individualthey certainly are, but to any one thoroughly familiar with thearchitectural fantasies of Piranesi, the source of inspiration is soobvious as to make it impossible that Rieth should not have known thework of his great Italian predecessor.The influence which Piranesi exerts on the cole des Beaux-Arts, andconsequently on the leading contemporary architects of both France andthe United States, is enormous, if hard to define. The use of detailwhich he furnishes is never-ceasing, but more important than this isthe constant inspiration sought in a study of those architecturalfantasies which he has filled with the qualities of grandeur andimmensity so much valued by the French to-day. The buildings of NewYork are covered with motives either inspired by Piranesi or takendirectly from his work--ornament much of which would never havecome into vogue but for him; while a recent number of a leadingarchitectural periodical, without acknowledgment, printed a design ofhis for its cover.It is ardently to be hoped that a wider and more just appreciation ofPiranesis unique work may gradually gain currency. Mere productivenessis, of course, of no intrinsic value; but that any human being shouldbe capable of so vast a labor as Piranesi must in itself excite inus a lively sense of wonder and admiration. When, moreover, it isfound that his work, in addition to putting the art of architectureunder an enormous debt, is distinguished by imagination, originality,sublimity, and immense skill of execution,--a certain portion of it atleast possessing these qualities to a degree unsurpassed by any artistusing the particular medium employed,--it is surely not unreasonable toattribute to their creator the rare quality of original genius.

CAFFINAuthor of The Story of Spanish Painting, Old Spanish Masters,Engraved by Timothy Cole, etc., etc.The phenomenon of Goya is among the curiosities of the history ofart. For in the latter half of the eighteenth century, when, underthe feeble Bourbon dynasty, Spain had reached the lowest ebb of hernational and artistic life, an artist arose who represented more thanany other her racial characteristics and was destined to exert aworld-wide influence on the art of the succeeding century.While the rest of Europe was seething with the spirit of revolution,Goya, the man, was already in revolt, and at the same time haddiscovered for himself a revolutionary form of art, which anticipatedby half a century the consciousness elsewhere of the need of a newmethod to fit the new point of view. In a word, he drove an enteringwedge into the contemporary classicalism that was based upon a dryimitation of Roman marbles and Raphaelesque compositions, restorednature to art, and adapted his vision of nature to the spirit ofinquiry, observation, and research that was in process of fermentation.Finally, he adjusted to his vision of life a method of composition,freer and more flexible than the older ones: that was preoccupied lesswith the representation of form than with the expression of movementand character; its aim, in fact, being primarily expressional. Thushe anticipated the motive of modern impressionism and determined inadvance the methods of rendering it.No less remarkable is the degree in which he was an avatar of themingled traits of his race. For ethnologically the Spaniard is aCelt, who first was disciplined by Roman civilization, then merged inthe flood of a Germanic wave, and later infused with the blood andculture of the Arab and the Moor. A truly wonderful amalgam--the ironichumor of the Celt; the mysticism, vigor, and grotesque imaginationof the forest-bred Goth; the subtle inventiveness, sensuousness, andabstraction of the Orient, and the uncouth strain of the Black Man,whom to-day we are discovering to be the flotsam of a far-off submergedcivilization in Darkest Africa. All these traits are recognizable inthe work of Goya that he did to please himself: namely, in his paintedfigure-subjects, other than portraits, and in his drawings and etchings.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: GOYA.

This would robthe story of art of a very picturesque personality; one, moreover,which seems to be quite convincingly represented in his art. He wasborn in 1746, in the little town of Fuendetodos near Zaragoza in theprovince of Aragn, his father being a small farmer. Reared amongthe hills, he breathed independence, throve mightily in bodily vigor,and proved precociously disposed to art. Accordingly, at the age offourteen he was put under a teacher, Luzan, in Zaragoza. But it wasnever Goyas way to take instruction from a spoon, and at this periodhe distinguished himself less as a student than as a roistering youngfellow, apt for gallantry and brawls and ready with his rapier. Havingdrawn on himself the attention of the authorities of the Inquisition,he found it convenient to proceed to Madrid. Here again his escapadesaroused notoriety, so that he abandoned the capital and set forth forRome, working his way to the sea-board by practising as a bull-fighter.In Rome he mainly nourished his artistic development by observationof the old masterpieces, meanwhile indulging in gallantries, whichculminated in a plot to rescue a young lady from a convent. This timehe found himself actually in the grip of the Inquisition and wasonly released from it by the Spanish ambassador, who undertook toship him back to Spain. Arrived the second time in Madrid he founda friend in the painter Francisco Bayeu, who gave him his daughter,Josefa, in marriage and introduced him to Mengs, the arbiter of artat Court. Josefa bore him twenty children, none of whom survived him,and patiently put up with his infidelities. Mengs had been urged bythe king, Charles III, to revive the Tapestry Works of Santa Barbara,and intrusted Goya with a series of designs, which to-day may be seenin the basement galleries of the Prado, while some of them, executedin the weave, adorn the walls of a room in the Escoril. The vogueat the time was for Bouchers pretty pastoral ineptitudes, but Goyatook a hint from Teniers and represented the actual pastimes of theSpanish people. He, however, far outstripped the Flemish artist in thevariety, naturalness, and vivacity of his subjects, while in the matterof composition he showed himself already a student of the harmonies ofnature rather than a perpetuator of studio traditions.These designs secured his general popularity and paved the way forhis _entre_ into royal favor at the accession of Charles IV in 1788.Goya, turned forty, was already the darling of the populace and nowbecame the cynosure of the Court. He would pit his prowess againstthe professional strong man in the streets of Madrid and plunged withequal aplomb and assurance into the gallantries of the royal circle,which was a hotbed of intrigue under the lax rgime of Queen MariaLuisa, whose amours were notorious. Foremost among her lovers wasManuel Godoy, whom she raised from the rank of a guardsman eventuallyto be prime minister. He embroiled his country in a war with England,and finally ratted to Napoleon, conniving at the invasion of theFrench troops and the placing of Joseph Bonaparte on the throne ofSpain. Meanwhile, in the interval before this _dbcle_, Goya, whiledipping into intrigue, notably with the beautiful Countess of Alba,and establishing his position as an artist to whom every one who wouldbe anybody must sit for a portrait, maintained an attitude of haughtymental exclusiveness. He was the rebel, the insurgent, the nihilist;lashing with the impartial whip of his satire the rottenness of theCourt and the shams and hypocrisies of the Middle Class, the Church,Law, Medicine, and even Painting. Also, like many devotees ofsensual pleasures, he was hot in his denunciation of lust, a terribleexponent of its consequences in satiety and sapped vitality.[Illustration: GOYA. BACK TO HIS ANCESTORS!Poor animal! The genealogists and the kings of heraldry have muddledhis brain, and he is not the only one.Manuel Godoy, satirized in this print, had a long and fictitiousgenealogy made for himself, according to which he was a directdescendant of the ancient Gothic kings of Spain.From _The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 39).][Illustration: GOYA. BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHERThe question is often raised whether men or women are superior. Thevices of either proceed from bad upbringing; where the men are depravedthe women likewise are depraved.From _The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 5).]This last is the theme of one of his most horribly arresting subjectsin oils, an allegory of the Fates, wherein lust and its accompanyingexhaustion represent the futility of mans existence. It is paintedin colors of extreme neutrality that almost amount to monochrome.Thus it illustrates a dictum of Goyas that color no more than lineexists in nature; there are only differences of light and shade. Itaccordingly prepares one for an appreciation of his etchings, in whichaquatint plays so intrinsically important a rle. As a painter he hadbegun with positive hues--to abandon them, as soon as he reached hismaturity, for a sparing use of color and a liberal differentiation ofcolor values. In this he was following Velasquez, whom he admitted tobe one of his teachers, the others being Rembrandt and nature. It wasRembrandt, unquestionably, who helped him to a vision of nature thatreduced itself to the principle of light and dark; but from natureherself he gained corroboration of the essential truth of such avision. How true it is the artist of the present day has learned fromGoya. Like the latter, he sees color in nature not as positive hues,but as a complex weave of varying intensities of light and shade thatplay over and transform the hues. It is by the correlation of thesevarying values that he builds up the structure and secures the planesof his composition, and realizes a unity and harmony of _ensemble_.And it is in Goyas etchings that he finds these principles of colorin relation to composition represented with most adequate reliance onsimplification, organization, and expression--the three watchwords ofcontemporary artists who are working in the latest modern spirit.Expression is the keynote of Goyas etchings, as it is of hispaintings. It is the quality of feeling rather than of seeing that isinterpreted. Thus, in the oil painting of the _Maja_, _Nude_, it wasGoyas intent not so much to represent the young form as to interpretthe expression of its youth through the play of light and shadow onthe supple torso and limbs; an expression so exquisitely subtle andtender that it defies the copyists attempted imitation and eludes theresources of photographic reproduction. Similarly, in the splendidimpressionism of the group-portrait of Charles IV and his family it isnot the appearance of the jewels, clustered on the breasts of the royalpair, but the effect of their luster that he designed to render. Andso throughout his drawings and etchings the prime purpose is not torepresent the thing seen but to suggest its effect upon the feelings.       *       *       *       *       *Goyas etched work, as catalogued in 1907 by Julius Hofmann, comprises268 pieces. These include 22 Various Subjects; 16 Studies afterVelasquez; 83 Caprices; 21 Proverbs; 82 Disasters of War and 44Tauromachies, or Scenes from the Bull-Fight. To this list of engravedwork are to be added 20 lithographs.The best known of these groups is _Los Caprichos_, etched in 1794-1798but not published until 1803. These _Caprices_ represent the mostspontaneous expression of Goyas temperament and of his attitude towardthe life and the society of his day. At the same time, the designs,as in the case of all his etchings and lithographs, were executedwith due deliberation, worked out previously in drawings in whichevery effect was carefully calculated and assured. With correspondingfidelity the drawings were copied on the plate.[Illustration: GOYA. THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED HERThe woman who does not know how to guard herself is the first tobe attacked. And it is only when there is no longer time to protectherself that she is astonished that she was carried off.From _The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 8).][Illustration: GOYA. BON VOYAGE!Where go they across the shadows, this infernal cohort which makes theair ring with their cries? If only there were daylight-- ... Then itwould be another thing: because with a gun we could bring them down....But it is night and nobody can see them. From _The Caprices_ (LefortNo. 64).]It is in this set that the creative quality of Goyas imagination ismost demonstrated. He could not only summon visions from the void, butclothe them in convincing shape. Whether he stretched some human typeto the limit of caricature or invested it with attributes of bird,beast, or reptile, or used some familiar form of animal, or createda hybrid monster, he had the faculty of giving it an actuality thatmakes it seem reasonable. As to the meaning of the subjects, thetitles which he himself gave them furnish, except in a few instances,an intelligible clue. Prints of this set were brought to England byofficers engaged in the Peninsular War and later found their way toParis and exercised a very conscious influence upon Delacroix. For theynot only echoed the turbulence of his own spirit, but helped him togive expression to his own visions of the horrible and fantastic. Thebest proofs are those of the first edition, many of which were pulledby the artist himself._The Proverbs_, although engraved between 1800 and 1810, were notpublished until 1850. While their subjects are often difficult tocomprehend, they show generally a marked technical advance over theprevious work. This is apparent not only in the character of thedrawing, but also in the increased simplification and more highlyorganized arrangement of the composition. Some of the latter, as forexample in the case of _The Infuriated Stallion_ and _The Bird-Men_,present designs of extraordinary distinction.The last prints of _La Tauromachie_ are dated 1815. This series fallsshort of the others in esthetic interest, being more conspicuouslyillustrative. It was, indeed, designed to represent the various phasesthrough which the baiting of bulls in Spain had passed. Beginning withthe early hunting of the bull in the open country, both on horsebackand on foot, it proceeds to the methods introduced by the Moors, whoare represented in the attire of Turks. Thence it gradually tracesthe development of a precise science and technique in the managementof the sport and incidentally commemorates the prowess of individualbull-fighters, beginning with the Emperor Charles V, and passing towell-known professional toreadors. Contemporary proofs of Goya are veryrare; and it was not until 1855 that a complete set was published inMadrid. A later issue, including seven extra prints, was published byLoizelet in Paris.[Illustration: GOYA.

THE BIRD-MENFrom _The Proverbs_ (Lefort No. 136)Size of the original etching, 8  12 inches]Of the _Disasters of War_ no prints exist prior to those of the setpublished by the Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Etched during 1810and the succeeding years of the Peninsular War, the _Disasters_ areregarded as the finest products of Goyas needle. Yet he was sixty-fouryears old when he commenced them. Though he had subscribed to theBonaparte rgime and still held the position of Court painter, helived apart from active affairs in the seclusion of his country home.The prints are inspired by his countrys sufferings, but he did notpublish them. To do so would have been to raise a protest against thecrime of the French invasion and to stir his countrymen to increasedpatriotism. Under the circumstances of his equivocal position Goya mayhave thought such a course impolitic. Perhaps he felt the nationalcondition to be hopeless. At any rate, he closed himself around in anatmosphere of profound pessimism. Was it for this they were born?is the legend beneath one of the prints which shows a heap of mangledcorpses. It is the note of the whole series--the criminal horror ofwar, and its futility. Nowhere else is the element of the _macabre_in his genius more fully revealed. The designs are in no senseillustrative; they are visions of his own brooding, projected againstdarkness and emptiness. Yet, just as in the _Caprices_ he gave bone andflesh to the eery fabrics of his imagination, so by the magic of hisneedle his abstract imaginings of the enormity of war became visualizedinto concrete actuality.Of Goyas lithographs it must suffice here to mention the set of fourprints, _The Bulls of Bordeaux_. They were executed in that city in1825. For after the expulsion of the French by Wellington and therestoration of the Bourbon dynasty in the person of Ferdinand VII, Goyaagain turned his coat. For your treason you deserve to be hanged,remarked the new king, but you are a great artist and I overlook thepast. He was reappointed Court painter; but, broken in health andspirits, so deaf that he could no longer indulge his musical taste inplaying, he obtained the kings permission to retire to Bordeaux, wherehe was cared for by a Madame Weiss and her daughter. It was duringthis time that he visited Paris and was enthusiastically welcomed byDelacroix and the other Romanticists. When he drew _The Bulls_ _ofBordeaux_ he was in his seventy-ninth year and able to work only withthe aid of a powerful magnifying-glass. Yet the prints in their intenseand vigorous movement show no slackening of artistic power. He diedthree years later, in 1828, and was buried in the cemetery of Bordeaux.After lying there for seventy-one years, his body was claimed by hiscountry and interred with honors in Madrid. For by this time the modernworld of art had recognized Goyas greatness and its own indebtednessto his genius.       *       *       *       *       *Goyas etchings reveal him a great master of design. The versatilityof his invention suggests the exuberance of nature, yet calculated artdetermines each composition. It is architectonic, organic, functional;possessing the quality of a built-up structure, with perfectcorrelation of its parts and absolute adjustment of means to end.Moreover, it carries the final mark of distinction in that it appearsto have grown: it has the vitality, movement, and character of a livingorganism. It is discovered to be the product of a new mating of natureand geometry, inspired by a wider and more penetrating observationof the former and a more extended and imaginative use of the latter.Hence, at times it strangely anticipates what we are now familiar within Oriental composition.Most remarkable also is the plastic quality, which is realized notonly in the _ensemble_ but also in the component parts. Goyascompositions are no mere patterning of surfaces, but an example ofactual space-filling, in the true sense that they occupy the thirddimension. The substance of his forms and their position in spaceare so concretely realized that they most actively excite the tactilesense. And yet, for all their concreteness, they are permeated with aquality of abstraction. Thus they fascinate alike by their actualityand their suggestion of a vision. They are frequently hideous, butin their capacity of sense-enhancement and in their stimulus to theesthetic intellectuality they are beautiful.[Illustration: GOYA. GOOD ADVICEAnd this advice is worthy of her who gives it. Worse yet is the damselwho follows it to the letter, and misfortune to the first one whoaccosts her! From _The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 15).][Illustration: GOYA. GOD FORGIVE HER--ITS HER OWN MOTHER!The damsel while young left her native land, served her apprenticeshipin Cadiz, and is now returned to Madrid.

The beautyturns and recognizes her--this poor old woman is her mother.From _The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 16).]And the beauty of these compositions is materially increased by thesense of color which they suggest. In consequence of Goyas influenceaquatint is coming largely into vogue with modern etchers; but he withthis process, and his contemporary, Turner, with mezzotint, were thefirst to explore fully the resources of tint in combination with line.The English artist, however, used it mainly as a convenient methodof representation. In Goyas hand it became a medium of intellectualand emotional expression, comparable to tone in music. Goya, in fact,by his study of nature, advanced the circle of his art, so that, onthe one hand, it embraced more of the universal geometry and, on theother, intersected more freely the circles of the other arts. Thus heanticipated the latest modern thought, in its consciousness of theessential unity of the arts and of the essential unity of art withlife.A NOTE ON GOYABY WILLIAM M. IVINS, JR.No other artist in black and white has ever exhibited such tremendousvitality as Goya. Look back along the line, and there is no maker ofprints who has put into them the same exuberant, full-blooded delightin life. For sheer physical strength Mantegna only may be comparedwith him. And, strangely, with this often almost delirious overflowof animal spirits there is the most remarkable sensitiveness to thesignificance of gesture. Who, except Hokusai, has ever expressed, inblack and white, _weight_--the heaviness of tired bodies, the leadenfall of an unconscious womans arm, or the buoyancy of excitement--asthis Spaniard? Who has ever made motion so moving--made young limbs sosupple, elastic, and graceful? His every line is kinetic--he does notrelate motion, he exhibits it--and in art as elsewhere deeds are worthmore than words.For sensitiveness to the beauty of the human body, for curiousresearch in the esthetic inversion, the beauty of the hideous, Goyastands alone. No one, not even Leonardo, has plumbed so deep in thehidden shadowy parts. No one has so pictured _fear_--theatricalities aplenty--but only here real terror.[Illustration: GOYA.

From_The Caprices_ (Lefort No. 12).]On the purely technical side--the broad massing of sharply contrastedlight and shade, the ability to tell a tale with the simplest means,the instinctive choice of the pictorially dramatic detail--Rembrandtand Goya stand alone.On another side that is purely technical, it should be borne inmind that Goya is the only one who has availed himself of all thepossibilities of aquatint--the only one who has used the medium withaudacity and resolution and success; the only one who has dared use itto express powerful and fundamental things.Goya, both in himself and for his influence, is one of the greatestartists that the world has seen these last hundred and fifty years--andhis greatest work is his black and white.THE ETCHINGS OF FORTUNYBY ROYAL CORTISSOZLiterary and Art Editor of the New York _Tribune_The etchings of Fortuny make an inviting theme, inviting in itselfand doubly sympathetic because it provokes talk about Fortuny. I havealways had a weakness for that endearing personality and I cannot, forthe life of me, go with foot-rule and a spirit of cold analysis throughthe twenty-five or thirty plates--twenty-nine, to be exact--recordedin the useful compendium of Beraldi. You cannot be pedantic about anartist whose work has meant to you an early enthusiasm and a lifelongsense of gaiety and brilliance. The first work of art I ever yearnedto possess was a drawing by Fortuny. I did not get it into my hands.The spell faded, but it was revived, and long afterward it involved mein an enchanting task. In Paris, one summer, the late Philip GilbertHamerton asked me to write a memoir of Fortuny and for two years Ispent a good deal of my leisure going hither and yon, collectingmaterial. The book never got itself written, for reasons which I foundboth pathetic and comic. Too much of the material aforesaid provedtoo heart-breakingly expensive. Mr. Hamerton and I and his Londonpublisher, the late Mr. Seeley, ruefully concluded as we counted upthe figures, that, humorously speaking, ruin stared us in the face. Weturned to other things.[Illustration: FORTUNY. ARAB WATCHING BESIDE THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FRIEND(Beraldi No. 1)Size of the original etching, 7  15 inches][Illustration: FORTUNY. IDYLL(Beraldi No. 4)Size of the original etching, 7  5 inches]That, as I have said, was years ago, but every now and then I goback to Fortuny, for old sakes sake if for no other reason, thoughhe was, of course, a remarkable artist to whom one would be bound,anyway, frequently to return. As a matter of fact, his genius hasneeded, of late, to be restored to the public consciousness. When theImpressionists came in, Fortuny, or perhaps I should more specificallysay, the hypothesis for which he stood, went out. One of the resultsof my understanding with Mr. Hamerton was a series of visits to the_palazzo_ in Venice which is still the home of Fortunys family, andthere you found a contrast that was full of meaning. On the _pianonobile_ Fortunys art held its own in numerous unfinished pictures,sketches, and the like. But, up-stairs, in his sons studio, all waschanged. When young Marianito sought inspiration as a painter, hedid not follow in his fathers footsteps, but went to Munich, and onhis walls I saw huge canvases illustrating Wagnerian motives in ahuge and splashy manner, strongly suggestive of Franz Stuck and hisfollowers. I confess that at this distance of time I do not recall veryaccurately just what they were all about; but I can remember as thoughit were yesterday how extremely different they were from the paintingsdown-stairs. Of course no one could blame Marianito. An artist mustseek salvation in his own way. But it is impossible not to feel acertain indignation over the ignorance of those who have tried to waveFortuny aside as a painter of bric-a-brac.We saw too much of that sort of thing when the works of Sorollaand Zuloaga were shown at the Hispanic Museum and people went intohysterics over them, talking especially about how the first of thesepainters was rejuvenating Spanish art. I used to hear such talk inMadrid, some fifteen years ago, amongst the younger men who were eventhen hailing Sorolla as a pioneer. They were right, and it is right,as I have argued elsewhere, to recognize in this painters work aninfluence of the highest value to the modern Spanish school. But therewere great men before Agamemnon, and it is stupid to ignore what wasdone for Spanish painting by Fortuny long before any one ever heardof Sorolla. I have great respect and plenty of admiration for thataccomplished technician, and yet I think that he himself, if pressedin the matter, would cheerfully admit that nothing he ever paintedcould quite touch the portrait in the Metropolitan Museum, _A SpanishLady_, which Fortuny painted in 1865. Outside of France that was not aparticularly good year amongst painters, but Fortuny, then twenty-sevenyears old, was proving himself not unworthy of Velasquez. He wasdrawing with mastery and he was painting blacks with amazing skilland taste, with amazing sensitiveness to the beauties lying entangledin one of the most difficult of a colorists problems. Indeed, I maynote in passing that this picture alone would show Fortuny to haveenforced lessons in tone which no Spaniard since his time, not even theprodigiously clever Sorolla, has begun to commence to prepare to equal.[Illustration: FORTUNY. THE SERENADE(Beraldi No. 10)Size of the original etching, 15  12 inches][Illustration: FORTUNY. A MOROCCAN SEATED(Beraldi No. 19)Size of the original etching, 5  4 inches]There are many other paintings of his over which it would be pleasantto linger, but, having the etchings in view, I forbear. At the sametime I have driven at nothing irrelevant in speaking of Fortunyscommand over the brush, for that is very closely related to hiscommand over the needle. It is important to remember, in the firstplace, that he was a born draughtsman. The fact was brought home tome when I made a pilgrimage to Barcelona, to see the big Moroccanbattle-piece which he painted for the municipality not long after hehad won the Prix de Rome. I saw in the spirited picture the Fortuny weall know, but I saw also, in some earlier pieces, the kind of academicwork that he did under the influence of old Soberano, his master atReus, where he was born in 1838. Yes, it was academic work, but itwas the work of a youngster of genius who had a _flair_ for form anddrew it with astonishing adroitness. There, to be sure, you have theessence of Fortuny, more even than in the glitter of light and colorconventionally associated with his name. The artists and critics whothink that the history of painting began with Manet are wont to damnFortuny with faint praise, talking about his dexterity as though thatwere a very ordinary and perhaps specious gift. Well, there is adexterity, there is a sleight of hand, as honest as anything that youwill find in Manet, and Fortuny had it. There are moments, no doubt, inwhich it takes your breath away as though by some deceptive stroke ofconjurors work. But at bottom there is a sterling sincerity about it,and this, I think, is sharply perceptible in the etchings.Paradoxically, these do not proclaim Fortuny what the master of etchingis wont to be--a lover of line for its own sake, a user of it as alanguage possessing its own special character and charm. Rembrandtsstrength and Whistlers exquisiteness were alike unknown to him. Thetruth is that Fortuny employed the needle somewhat as he employed thepen, simply for purposes of swift and free expression. There are somebewitching drawings of his, reproduced by the Amand-Durand process inthe memoir by Baron Davillier, and there are others in the catalogue ofthe great sale of his studio effects in 1875, which, for the impressionthey leave, might almost be regarded as etchings. The impression ineither category is very much one of black-and-white. Has not Fortunybeen the master of a generation of illustrators? Nevertheless hisdrawings and his etchings are not absolutely interchangeable. In thelatter there is too much of the painter for that; his figures are tooclosely modeled and his backgrounds are too transparent. Some of hisplates, such as _The Serenade_, _The Anchorite_, the _Kabyle Mort_, and_The Farrier_, are wonderfully rich in color such as no pen draughtsmancould secure. He knew how to fill his backgrounds with deep warm tone,and he could use the same vivifying touch in his treatment of thefigure. It is worth while to go carefully through the little collectionof etchings that he left, looking more particularly for thoserather thin staccato effects which his imitators affect--one is sodelightfully disappointed. I have spoken of his sincerity, his honesty.Amongst all the plates there is only one, _La Victoire_, which hintsa contradiction. There is something factitious about the composition,recalling the Sicilian nudities hawked about by the photographers inSouthern Italy. But even this etching has undeniable brilliance asa piece of technique, and, for the rest, Fortuny is the quite artlessconnoisseur of picturesqueness, etching his Moorish types and hisportraits in the mood of the serious observer of nature aiming at thetruth. On two or three occasions he appears to have let his fancy rove.His _Amateur de Jardin_ and his _Mditation_ both belong amongst thosegraceful studies of costume and pseudo-romantic sentiment with whichhis paintings have made us so familiar. And once he turned poet in asmall way, etching that charming _Idylle_ which may reflect no emotionwhatever, but has, at all events, a certain dainty elegance; but do notthink that Fortuny was really a poet. It was not in his temperament. Hewas sensuous, mundane, in the soul of him; the very man to enjoy justthe career that fell to his lot.[Illustration: FORTUNY.

INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JOSEPH, MADRID(Beraldi No. 21)Size of the original etching, 5  9 inches]New Yorkers will recall the sale here of the collection formed by thelate W. H. Stewart in Paris, the Cher Monsieur Guillermo of morethan one of the artists letters printed by Davillier. It was full ofFortunys, which made a dazzling array when they were put up at auction.But it was better to see them scattered about in Mr. Stewarts home bythe Seine, and there they breathed the atmosphere of a clearly definedcharacter. You did not think of Fortuny in Spain, quietly paintingat Granada; you did not think of him on the more adventurous soil ofMorocco, nor did you dwell on thoughts of his days in Rome and on thebeach at Portici. You thought, instead, of the Fortuny who took thecollectors of Paris by storm, who moved Thophile Gautier to jeweledeloquence, who was young, successful, and happy, who had a great giftand used it truly with a _gaillard_ grace. He was not the speciousentertainer, bemusing his audience with incredible tricks. All hiswizardry, all his diabolical cleverness, was quite natural to him,springing from his heart and in no wise diminishing his weight andseriousness as a student of nature. Beraldi applauds his etchings fortheir originality. Let us honor them too for their fidelity to life,for their simple strength, as well as for their light, vivacious charm.PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SIR SEYMOUR HADEN, P.R.E.PART IBY FREDERICK KEPPELMany treatises have been published on Seymour Haden the artist, but notone, as yet, on Seymour Haden the man. This is as it should be; becauseno one can write freely and frankly on the personality of a famous manwhile that man is still living, and Sir Seymour lived until the year1910, when he died at the great age of ninety-three.I met him often every year for about thirty years, and I first madehis acquaintance when he lived in his very handsome house in thearistocratic region known as Mayfair, in the west end of London. Hishouse adjoined the residence of the Lord Chief Justice of England.The doctrine held by the ancients that the Goddess of Fortune wasstone-blind has much to warrant it. Let us take the case of threecontemporary nineteenth-century etchers, all three being men of genius.I mean the two French masters, Charles Meryon and Jean-Franois Millet,and the Englishman Seymour Haden. The two French etchers lived in direpoverty and often had to go hungry because they had not the means topay for a meal; while, to their English contemporary, the lines werefallen in pleasant places and he never knew the wants that pinch thepoor.Born in 1818, in his fathers fine house in Sloane Street, LondonWest, Francis Seymour Haden had the advantage of coming of a good andwell-known family, in easy circumstances, and the further advantage ofhaving received an excellent university education, so that he foundhimself, from the first, the social equal of many of the best in theland, and he never had to invade and overcome that formidable socialbarrier which in England so sternly divides the somebodies fromthe nobodies; and during his long and active life he certainly didnothing to diminish or discredit the high social standing to which hewas born and bred.This being so, he remained to the end of his life an ideal Toryaristocrat, a condition which might be compared to that of the Bourbonkings, who never forgot anything and never learned anything. Inmaintaining any opinion which he had formed, or inherited, he was asimmovable as the rock of Gibraltar, and it made no difference to him iflater evidence showed that his earlier opinions were wrong.[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF SEYMOUR HADEN AT THE AGE OF SIXTY-TWOFrom the engraving by C. W. SherbornSize of the original engraving, 6  3 inches][Illustration: PORTRAIT OF SEYMOUR HADEN AT THE AGE OF FORTY-FOURFrom his etching from life, done in 1862Size of the original print, 7  10 inches]I well remember hearing that man of genius, Henry Ward Beecher, say ina sermon: Talk of the sin of Pride--we havent half enough of it! Bethat as it may, Seymour Haden was always a proud man, and this innatepride sometimes rendered him intolerant of the opinions of other goodmen whose ideas were also entitled to due respect. Indeed, I have neverknown a man who set a higher value on himself. Nothing was too goodfor him--whether it might be his collection of the best prints byolder masters, his house and its appointments great and small, or theinstruments which he used when he practised surgery,--everything mustbe of the very best. This determination of his was, within limits, anoble one, although it sometimes made him intolerant of other men whowere unable to rise to his high ideals.In this ingrained pride and self-esteem of Seymour Hadens he was fartoo proud to be vain. I do not think he had any vanity at all. Inthis respect he differed, as far as the east is from the west, fromhis illustrious brother-in-law, Whistler. The latters lifelong habitwas to pose and to perform like an actor on the stage--whether hisaudience consisted of many auditors or of only one; while Haden, thoughan eminently well-bred gentleman, cared nothing whatever about theimpression he might be making on his auditors--so long as his actionswere approved by himself. On such occasions all went charmingly untilsome other person uttered a heterodox opinion on art, or politics, orany other subject; but when that happened Sir Seymours indignationwould burst forth like a raging volcano.On one such occasion, while I was a guest in his country house, Iinfuriated him--though with no evil intention. It was at the time whenthe patriot Charles Stewart Parnell was making such a brave struggle inthe House of Commons on behalf of Home Rule for Ireland, I expressedmy admiration for Parnell, when Sir Seymour got very angry and somade all the company uncomfortable. Thus far I did not blame myself;but a year later I certainly was ashamed of my own indiscretion. Ihad quite forgotten about the outbreak of the former year and I againexpressed my warm sympathy with the cause of Irish Home Rule. It wasjust at the beginning of dinner at Sir Seymours hospitable table, butno sooner had I mentioned the subject than he flung down knife andfork, marched out of the dining-room, banged the door behind him, andtramped up-stairs to his bedroom. That sweet woman, Lady Haden, said tome very quietly, We shall see no more of Sir Seymour to-night, andnext morning, before my host appeared at breakfast, his very tactfulwife, laying her hand gently on my arm, said to me, Mr. Keppel, inconversing with my husband, pray avoid the subject of Home Rule inIreland. Most readers would think that the little incident endedhere; but it didnt. Presently Sir Seymour came down to breakfast andcarried in his hand a large and handsome book which he presented tome. On the fly-leaf I read a long and most kindly dedication writtenby himself; and so _that_ was the end of the incident. I remember thatwhen I received this _amende honorable_ my first impulse was to recalla characteristic Irish adage which says: First cut my head, an thengive me a plasther![Illustration: SIR SEYMOUR HADENFrom the drawing by Alphonse Legros, done in 1895][Illustration: WOODCOTE MANOR (the Home of Sir Seymour Haden)From the etching by Percy ThomasSize of the original etching, 6  10 inches]Lady Haden was, in a very quiet and refined way, a remarkable woman.She was daughter of an American army officer, Major Whistler, and shebore the Puritan Christian names of Deborah Delano. In more than oneof Sir Seymours etchings her first name is quieted down to Dasha.She was half-sister to the great Whistler, who was the issue of herfathers second marriage, and she clung to her brother Jimmie to theend of her life. All the art which was inherent in the Whistlerfamily manifested itself in Lady Hadens music. She was a marvelousreader of piano music, and when Sir Seymour got possession of the fineold Elizabethan mansion of Woodcote Manor in Hampshire, Lady Haden,perceiving that there was no musical skill among the young men of theneighboring village of Bramdean, organized a band or orchestra forthese rustics. To one she taught the violin, to another the flute, toanother the trombone, etc. After about two years of drilling I hadthe opportunity of hearing her band performing in the school-house atBramdean, and they played respectably well, while the sweet old ladyconducted the music with her baton. Toward the end of her life shebecame totally blind, and after that I never was more affected in mylife than when, at Woodcote Manor, I saw her grope her way to her pianoand heard her play, superbly, some great compositions by Beethoven andChopin.At Woodcote Manor Sir Seymour enjoyed his life thoroughly (exceptwhen something went wrong and made him angry). The mansion stood inits own park and there was a beautiful old garden inclosed with highstone walls. One summer when his long hedge of sweet pea was in fullbloom he took me to see it and told me that he had thought out a newand interesting botanical fact, on which he had written a paper forthe learned Royal Society, and that he intended to send it to them inLondon and to invite some eminent botanists of the Society to come toWoodcote and see the phenomenon for themselves. His theory was thatgarden flowers always had a tendency to return to the original color ofthe same blossoms in the wild plant, especially when the garden plantgrew tall, and then he showed me that, in his hedge of sweet pea, thepurple blossoms at the top were much more numerous than the flowers ofpink or blue or white which were lower down, thus proving that when agarden sweet pea grew tall the blossoms returned to the original purplecolor of the wild pea.I had always been somewhat of a horticulturist myself and so I said tohim: It is evident that the plants here bearing purple flowers growtaller than the others; but you must remember that any single plantof sweet pea can give you nothing but one and the same color in itsblossoms. Sir Seymour sent for his pig-headed old Hampshire gardener,put the question to him, and although the old man was greatly in aweof his master he gave his decision on my side and against Sir Seymour.You are a pair of fools, was the old gentlemans angry answer, and hestarted to leave us. But I overtook him and said: Now, Sir Seymour, itis not fair to me to leave this little scientific question undecided.Pray come back for a few minutes and let me cut two or three of yourplants at the roots, disentangle them from the hedge, and show you thatalthough they mingle when growing close together yet you never getmore than one colored bloom from one plant. To this he consented, andof course my demonstration showed that his theory was wrong; but hisanger against me lasted till bedtime, and it was only next morning thathe said to me: Keppel, you made me angry yesterday about those sweetpeas,--but, all the same, I am glad you saved me from making a damnedfool of myself before the Royal Society.[Illustration: REPRODUCTION, IN REDUCED SIZE, OF A PAGE OF MANUSCRIPTIN THE HANDWRITING OF SIR SEYMOUR HADEN][Illustration: FACSIMILE, IN REDUCED SIZE, OF THE CERTIFICATE OFSEYMOUR HADENS CANDIDACY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE ATHENUM CLUB]Sir Seymours anger on this occasion was mild compared with the ragehe flew into with his gardener when, after the master had been absentfor a day in London, he returned and found that his man had spent alaborious day in scraping off the beautiful green moss which adornedthe trunks and larger branches of the old apple-trees in the garden. Iwas with Sir Seymour when he made the distressing discovery and I heardthe furious sound of the vials of wrath which he poured on the stupidold mans head. After Sir Seymour had gone the poor gardener saidto me: And thats my thanks for having worked hard to make his oldapple-trees look neat and tidy!Besides being a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Sir SeymourHaden was a member of the most exclusive club in London--if not in theworld--the Athenum. It generally took from fifteen to twenty years forany candidate to be elected. Sir Seymour had to wait eighteen years.The usage of this club is to hang on the wall a large sheet of papersetting forth the name and the qualities of the candidate, and anymember who approved of this candidate would sign this paper. Whethermany of these eminent persons had much idea of the quality of a fineetching is quite another matter, but Sir Seymours nomination sheetat the club was crammed with signatures of eminent men advocatinghis election. Among these signatures are those of Robert Browning,Anthony Trollope, Matthew Arnold, Dr. Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury;Huxley, the great scientist; Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, and Sir E.J. Poynter, now President of the Royal Academy of Arts. Besides thesignatures of these famous men who had achieved greatness othersigners of this Athenum document had been born great, includingseveral hereditary peers; and--to finish Shakespeares sentence--thegentleman chiefly concerned never waited to have greatness thrust uponhim, for he was always quite willing to meet greatness half-way.The Athenum Club is so desperately exclusive that no member canbring in an outsider except to a little sentry-box inside the mainportal, which room is only large enough to accommodate two persons.On one occasion when I was visiting Sir Seymour I did one of the fewdeliberately wicked things that ever I did in my life. As I stood inthe little sentry-box I perceived His Grace the Archbishop of Yorkentering with a friend at the front door of the club. The two walkedstraight to the glass door of the little sentry-box where I was, andthe eminent prelate said to his friend, in a loud authoritative voice:We can sign the documents here in a moment. Then it was that Satanentered into me. I knew that this was my only chance ever to make aBritish archbishop wait till I was good and ready, and so, although Ihad finished my business with Sir Seymour, I began talking and talkingabout his friends in Paris and what they were doing, until I kept thevery impatient archbishop striding up and down before the little doorfor more than ten minutes, and twice when I caught his eye he looked athis watch, glared at me, and exclaimed, Dear me, how tiresome! (Itwill be remembered that in genteel English parlance the word tiresomemeans annoying or provoking.) At last, when I could talk no more,Sir Seymour rose from his chair, opened the door, and met the ragingDr. Maclagan outside. Oh, Archbishop, said he, I do hope we have notkept you waiting, and His Grace made answer in a very fretful voice,Well, in point of fact, Sir Seymour, _you have!_ I cannot claim thatthis prank of mine did me any credit, but in my boyhood days in Englandmy family and I had suffered from the pomposity of English prelates.[Illustration: HADEN.

BATTERSEA REACHA view of the Thames at Battersea, etched in 1863, looking out ofWhistlers windowSize of the original etching, 5  8 inches]The feud between Seymour Haden and Whistler was known throughoutEurope. Whistler loathed Haden and Haden detested Whistler. But SirSeymour drew a distinction between the man whom he abominated and theartist whom he greatly admired. This admiration led him to make anotable collection of Whistlers prints. On one occasion Sir Seymoursaid to me that if he were forced to part with his Rembrandt etchingsor with his Whistlers he would find it hard to determine which mastersworks he must let go. Later on I repeated this saying to Whistler andthat modest gentleman calmly remarked: Why, Haden should first partwith his Rembrandts, of course.Among the historic questions which can never be definitely determinedis the one--whether Seymour Haden was the man who kicked Whistlerdown-stairs or whether it was Whistler who administered this violenttreatment to Haden. I have heard the story from both, and each of theseeminent men stoutly maintained that _he_ had been the kicker and hisadversary the kicked one.As president of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers Sir Seymour dida great work in maintaining sound doctrine in etching. Nothing wasadmitted which was commercial in character, and etchings which weredone after paintings by other hands were rigorously ruled out.The membership comprised foreign as well as British artists, andmembership was eagerly sought for,--so much so that many famous etchersnever were elected, although they tried hard to be.The members often had to complain of the masterful ways of theirpresident; he ruled them with a rod of iron, but still the malcontentswere forced to endure it,--well knowing that no other man could give tothe Society the prestige and authority that Seymour Haden gave to it.In all other art exhibitions a good thing, done by an outsider, isaccepted and welcomed, but the Royal Society of Painter-Etchersexhibits nothing except the work of its own members.We have seen that Sir Seymour Haden, in spite of his goodqualities--and his great qualities--was a man of a domineering anddisputatious nature. I know of no figure in dramatic literature whomhe resembled so closely as Sheridans _Sir Anthony Absolute_. Both ofthese _Sirs_ were of a violent and masterful temper, and yet both ofthem were good men.[Illustration: HADEN.

THOMAS HADEN OF DERBYThomas Haden of Derby, my grandfather, was, under a polished exterior,one of the most determined men I have ever known, and one of thebravest. He would have made a hero of romance if he had had the chance.At the age of eighty-five he defended his home against the whole mob ofDerby, keeping them at bay all night.Seymour Haden.Size of the original etching, 13  9 inches]Besides Seymour Hadens signal achievements as etcher and as surgeon,and his zeal as an angler, he, like some other good men, had a specialhobby which he rode for years, and which he often ventilated in theLondon _Times_. His theory was that no corpse should be buried in asolid wooden coffin, but that it should be inclosed in a loose wickercase, where the earth could come in direct contact with the dead body.He contended that such contact would very quickly turn earth toearth. One of his demonstrations was practised on the dead body ofa large old sow that died in his farm-yard. (The animals name, Iremember, was Mary Jane.) Sir Seymour had Mary Jane buried in thegarden, in a shallow grave, and he had a covering of not more thanthree inches of earth laid over her. Then every visitor to WoodcoteManor had to visit the grave and to use his olfactory organs over it. Imyself had to do this on two occasions and I must say that I detectedno foul odor whatever.For more than twenty years I enjoyed a peculiar privilege in connectionwith Woodcote Manor. The old couple, used to the stir and bustle ofLondon, where they had troops of friends, sometimes found themselvessomewhat lonely in the solitude of Hampshire, and so it happened thatfor more than twenty years I was given _carte blanche_ to invite toWoodcote any person I pleased. I was very particular as to the personswhom I thus invited; but the people so invited were charmed with theirvisit, whether it lasted for three days or for two weeks, and theEnglish know very well how to make a guest comfortable.In the park at Woodcote Manor there is an etched tablet, nailed to thetrunk of an ancient hawthorn-tree. It reads:  A loyal friend through weal and woe,    At last, stern death oertakes him:  Here sleeps my loving, wise old crow,    Till Gabriels trumpet wakes him.I wrote this epitaph at Lady Seymour Hadens request. She gave to mydear old pet crow a resting-place when he died. That crow was more likea friend than a pet. On Atlantic steamers he would fly about among thesea-gulls, and in London I used to open the windows and he flew wherehe pleased, but I was always sure that he would come back to me.       *       *       *       *       *The present article is already so long that I must not prolong itfurther; but in a later number of THE PRINT-COLLECTORS QUARTERLY Iintend to give an account of Sir Seymour Hadens visit to the UnitedStates.PART IISEYMOUR HADEN IN AMERICAThe former chapter of my article on Sir Seymour Haden referred entirelyto my experiences with him in Europe; this second and concludingportion will contain nothing except an account of his sayings anddoings during his visit to the United States in the year 1882. Thepurpose of his American visit was to expound and vindicate theimportance of original etching as a fine art. This he did by deliveringa series of lectures on the subject, and these lectures, in the main,were very well received.[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF SEYMOUR HADENFrom a photograph from life: taken in New York in 1882][Illustration: CHAMPNEY. PORTRAIT OF SIR SEYMOUR HADENSketched (unknown to him) in the Print Room of the British Museum by J.Wells Champney of New York. Sir Seymour afterward wrote on this sketch.Excellent! S. H. 1899.Size of the original drawing, 9  8 inches]Being a born and case-hardened controversialist he soon found out thatin America no mans unproved _ipse dixit_, however eminent he mightbe, was dutifully accepted as it would have been in one of the oldercivilizations of Europe, and so it came about that several unprofitablecontroversies were hotly waged on both sides. Seymour Haden wasby nature pugnacious and toplofty, and such an attitude went downbadly in America. But, all the same, the man himself was treated withdistinguished consideration here, and his lectures did genuine good tothe cause of true art. He lectured in all our principal cities from NewYork to Chicago, and although when he landed here I think he had veryfew personal acquaintances (except myself), yet when he sailed back toEngland he took with him the cordial friendship and good will of manyAmericans of the right sort.His first lecture was delivered before a distinguished audience inChickering Hall, Fifth Avenue, New York. He had plenty of voice tomake his auditors hear him; but his lecture dragged considerably--fora peculiarly British reason: it is known to some of us that in anEnglishmans public oration he is not genteel or distinguished ifhe speaks freely and fluently. No, no; he must befog and entanglehis words with all sorts of hesitations and amendments. It is thesame in the British House of Commons. I do not mean such masterorators as Gladstone was, but the public speech of the averageBritish member,--let us call him Sir Huddleston Fuddleston--soundslike this: The honorable, hum--the honorable and gallant memberfrom--ha--hum--from Hull, has been good enough to--a--um--to_say_--etc.Well, Seymour Haden modeled his oratory on this preposterous butgenteel British usage; and yet, in private conversation, I have neverknown a man who used more elegant and appropriate language than he. Onthe day following that of the lecture, I received a visit from my kindand valued friend the Right Reverend Monsignor Doane, who was a genuinelover of fine prints, and he said to me: Well, I heard your Englishfriend last evening humming and hawing through his lecture. Soonafterward I had the opportunity of bringing these two distinguishedmen together, and after that, during his yearly visit to England, themonsignor used to be a welcome and honored guest of Sir Seymour andLady Haden. The artists lectures in Boston were listened to withearnest attention and he was the guest of honor at a reception givenat the St. Botolph Club; but even there storms and tempests arose. Hequarreled with the one eminent American whom, the rest of us wouldthink, nobody could quarrel with,--namely, Oliver Wendell Holmes.It was all about a fool difference of opinion on some question ofmedical ethics and usages in America as compared with England.[Illustration: HADEN.

ON THE TESTThis plate and _A Water Meadow_ were done on the same day, one atnoon, the other very late in the evening.

He brought it to me, and said: Now, what should I _know_ aboutthese people? I wrote down for him as many notes as I could, and whenhe met the Bostonians, I was astonished to see how well he had coachedhimself about them. On his return to New York, he received a greatnumber of letters. He was staying at the old Hotel Brunswick, FifthAvenue, and every morning I had to go there and tell him who was whoamong the writers of the letters. One day he was called down to theparlor by a message that a lady wished to see him. He went down andwhen he came back to his room carrying a card in his hand, he said tome, Well, I certainly am in an extraordinary country. That visitor,whom I never knew, is evidently a lady, and she has invited me to comeand spend a week with her husband and herself at Yonkers. Glancing atthe card, I read the name of Mrs. James B. Colgate, and said to SeymourHaden, I should certainly advise you to accept, and I went on to saythat it was easy enough for a stranger from England to see our publicshow places, big hotels, etc., but not so easy to get an entre tothe home of a really nice American family. Seymour Haden accepted theinvitation and spent a week with Mr. and Mrs. Colgate. In those years,I myself lived in Yonkers, and I called on him at the Colgate housethe day after his arrival there. The eminent banker showed us into hislibrary, and leaving us alone he closed the door. The English visitor,first looking around to see that there was no other person present,said to me in a sort of whisper: I am very comfortable here, withbut one serious drawback. I have been in the habit, all my life, oftaking wine with my dinner; but last evening, what do you suppose theygave me in the place of wine?--_milk!_ This was about nine oclock atnight, and when I got home I stated the case to my dear old mother. Shelaughed a little wickedly, and said, I think I can help your friendin this case. We happened to have some very good sherry. The old ladygot a large flat bottle, filled it with the wine, corked it and put itinto an innocent-looking pasteboard box, telling me to take it to him.Before leaving my home, I wrote a brief note to Seymour Haden sayingthat the package which I had to deliver to him must be opened only inthe privacy of his own chamber. The Colgates were total abstainers ofso pronounced a kind that when Mr. Colgate rented any house of his inYonkers, he made a condition in the lease that no intoxicants of anykind were ever to be received in that house. Further than that, oneof his principles was, not only never to drink wine or spirits, butnever to touch or carry them. When I got back to Mr. Colgates house,it was ten oclock at night, and all the lights in the big house wereextinguished and the doors locked. I rang and rang at the bell, and atlast Mr. Colgate himself, wearing trousers and slippers, opened thedoor. I had to manufacture a small fiction, which recalls Sir WalterScotts couplet:  Oh, what a tangled web we weave,  When first we practise to deceive.Mr. Colgate said to me rather fretfully that all the household hadretired, and that Mr. Seymour Haden must wait until the morning. Isaid to him in reply, that he would do me a great favor, if when hewas passing his guests chamber door, he would knock at it and deliverthe package, and this Mr. Colgate consented to do. Some days later areception was given to Seymour Haden at the Lotos Club, Fifth Avenue,and I accompanied him from Yonkers to New York on that occasion. WhenMr. Haden found himself safe in the train, he said to me: I couldnthave slept a wink except for that excellent sherry that your mothersent me, but I took deucd good care to carry away the empty bottlein my bag. I remember that from the train we saw the gorgeous sightof the sun setting behind the Palisades, and mirrored in the HudsonRiver, and Mr. Haden said to me, with something like reproach in hisvoice: Now, why have I never been told of the beauty of all this?Later on, he said to me, looking about in the crowded train: Now,isnt it melancholy to think that nobody among all these people, exceptmyself (and perhaps you), has the slightest sense of the beauty of thismagnificent sunset! I was tempted to say to him that he had no rightto assume such callous insensibility on the part of the Americans, butthough I thought it, I did not say it. Seymour Hadens reception at theLotos Club was a notable function. I remember that the President, theHon. Whitelaw Reid, made a very graceful speech in honor of his guest,and I recall vividly the marvelous cleverness of a very young man whohad been invited to entertain the company. One of this young mansmonologues represented an intimate talk between three Italian operasingers, the soprano, the tenor, and the basso; the three continuallyinterrupting one another. The speaking of the young man was in fakeItalian, and the three speaking voices were admirably differentiated.I inquired who this young man was, and was told that he was the son ofthe famous oratorio singer, Madame Rudersdorf of Boston, that his namewas Richard Mansfield, and that he was studying for the stage. I thenuttered a prophecy that that young man would be a great actor later on;and so he was.[Illustration: HADEN.

A SUNSET IN IRELANDThis plate, and also _A By-road in Tipperary_, were done in the parkof Viscount Hawarden, in the most beautiful part of Tipperary. SeymourHaden.Size of the original dry-point, 5  8 inches]After his return from Boston, the artist spent several weeks in NewYork, and while he was there, I arranged for him the first publicexhibition of his etchings which was ever made in America. The NewYork press took up the subject with enthusiasm, and every importantnewspaper printed a long review of the artist and his work. Icollected all of these very laudatory articles, and took them to Mr.Haden at the Hotel Brunswick. Next day he said to me, Do you knowthat these reviews of the New York press are distinctly abler and moreintelligent than if they had been written in London? He added, I wishyou would pay my particular compliments to the gentleman who wrote thereview in the New York _World_; that article in particular I found tobe admirable. He was surprised when he saw me begin to laugh, but Iexplained to him that the gentleman in question was a lady, and thearticle which he so greatly admired was from the pen of Mrs. Schuylervan Rensselaer.One very seldom finds that the imaginative and creative artist isalso endowed with a logical and judicial cast of mind. It was so withSeymour Haden. He had brought from England a large collection ofexcellent lantern-slides to illustrate these lectures by means of astereopticon, and in the lecturers zeal to glorify original etchingat the expense of prints done by any other method, he had procured onelantern slide of the beautiful little portrait which Rembrandt hadetched of himself, the complete print of which is hardly bigger thana postage stamp. It was the _Rembrandt  trois moustaches_. Alongsideof this, Mr. Haden had printed a morsel of the same size, taken from acrude and unimportant part of the foreground of William Sharps famousline-engraving of the _Holy Family_, after the painting by Sir JoshuaReynolds. Thus this special pleader, Haden, displayed an etching inits entirety, and less than one-hundredth part of a line-engraving ofvery large size. Wherever, during his lectures, this illustrationwas exhibited by a stereopticon, there was a universal outcry againstthe unfairness of it. People all, with one accord, declared that if theartist wanted to confront and contrast etching with line-engraving,fairness would require the lecturer to have chosen two prints of thesame size; but there was no budging Seymour Haden, when he had formedan opinion.[Illustration: HADEN. A LANCASHIRE RIVER.A well-known salmon pool on the Ribble. In Sir Seymours opinion thisis one of his very finest plates.

SAWLEY ABBEYSawley Abbey stands by a salmon river, the Ribble, which here isenlarged into a wide pool. Seymour Haden often came here for his salmonfishing.Size of the original etching, 10  14 inches]While in New York, he visited the exhibition of paintings at theNational Academy of Design, and was escorted through the galleriesby the late James D. Smillie, N.A. When his eye fell upon a certainpainting, he suddenly stopped as if he were paralyzed. Who didthat picture? It is the work of one of our New York artists, MissSo-and-So. Why do you allow such dreadful things on your walls?Well, said Mr. Smillie, we like to exemplify various phases in art.Hum, rejoined Seymour Haden, while glaring at the picture; she oughtto be _disemboweled_!Of at least one of our well-known American artists, Seymour Hadenexpressed the strongest admiration. This was the late John Lafarge,N.A., and he also spoke with enthusiasm of the original Americanetchings of thirty years ago, the work of such men as Stephen Parrish,Charles A. Platt, Peter Moran, and Joseph Pennell. On seeing a verylarge, intricate plate by Mr. Parrish, Mr. Haden made the remark tome, That young man does not know what the sense of fatigue in makinga picture is. Even at this period, Seymour Haden was known throughoutEurope as being the judge _par excellence_ of a fine print, and he wasalso recognized as an admirable judge of paintings.While on this subject of Hadens learned judgment of pictures, I willrecord what he remarked to me after he had visited Niagara for thefirst time. What he said was: No artist, except Turner, should haveever dared to attempt making a picture of the Falls of Niagara.One of Seymour Hadens exceptionally good days was the Sunday which hespent in visiting that famous art collector and admirable man, JamesL. Claghorn, of Philadelphia. On that occasion, I myself was includedas a sort of make-weight. The Englishman, with genuine zeal, wentthrough Mr. Claghorns collection of prints, and he wrote with pencilon several of them that they were exceptionally fine.On another side Mr. Haden excelled as a judge, and that was in thematter of first-class food and first-class cooking. At lunch, ourhost treated us to a delicious dish of terrapin. Seymour Haden foundit wonderfully good and declared that not only had he never tastedterrapin before, but he had never heard of the dish. Oh, yes, saidI to him; you certainly have heard of terrapin; dont you rememberat church on Sundays, when they sing the Te Deum, they sing,Terrapin and Seraphim. Oh, tut, tut, said he, I want to hear noirreverence.Seymour Haden had ranked as a very able physician. An incident occurredwhile we were at Mr. Claghorns house which shows how wise he was inthis respect: Mr. Claghorn was a huge and corpulent man of about sixty,but he was full of force and energy. While we were in his library hegot up and bustled out on some errand, and Seymour Haden said to me:Your friend will not live long, and when he dies he will go offvery suddenly. I was shocked on hearing such an unexpected prophecy,and I asked Mr. Haden how long Mr. Claghorn was likely to live. Inanswer he said, Just about two years. Two years later, within tendays of the time Haden had designated, Mr. Claghorn suddenly fell dead.[Illustration: HADEN. THE BREAKING-UP OF THE AGAMEMNONPerhaps, all things considered, the artists masterpiece. Collectorsdiffer as to the relative merits of the various etchings by SeymourHaden, but all are agreed in ranking this as a masterpiece, Moreover,it was the first etching to be treated in this particular manner, andit has become the model for many imitators. This fine plate was etchedon the Thames, at Greenwich, in 1870. Sir Seymour devoted the moneyobtained from the sale of the proofs to the aid of the London Hospitalfor Incurables.Size of the original etching, 7  16 inches][Illustration: HADEN. CALAIS PIEREtched by Seymour Haden after the painting by J. M. W. Turner in theNational Gallery, London. This superb etching stands alone in thehistory of the art. The scene could not be more strongly felt nor morevividly presented had the etcher been working from nature instead offrom a painting by another hand. When this etching appeared, SeymourHaden received an enthusiastic letter from John Ruskin, in which thelatter exhorted him to devote the remainder of his life to etching thepaintings of Turner.Size of the original print, 23  33 inches]Still continuing the subject of Mr. Hadens critical judgment indining. I may mention that wherever he went, he would never partake, ata hotel, of a _table dhte_ meal. He insisted on selecting particulardishes which he wished for, and he had them specially cooked for him.On his return from Cincinnati, he told me that while there he met myown dear friend, the late Herman Goepper, and he had given him, at aclub, the very best, and best-served, dinner that he had ever partakenof.Seymour Hadens course of lectures at Chicago was a great success, anda very notable reception was tendered to him. During the course ofthat reception, a very influential Chicago lady marched up and saidin a loud voice: Why dont you _educate_ your women in England?I know what you mean, said the Englishman, but we dont like tohave our English women crammed with a lot of abstruse _isms_ and_ologies_. Another lady, who thought the English guest had been ratherunfairly attacked, said to him, Now, Mr. Haden, cant you attack herin return? Well, yes, said he: in America, you dont know how tomake tea, and your table knives will not cut anything. Another littledispute arose in Detroit. Haden had arrived late at night, very muchfatigued, at the Russell House. At about eight oclock in the morninghe was awakened from a much-needed sleep by a sound of hammering andgrinding in the wall outside his window. He got up, raised the window,and saw two men boring a hole into the front wall of the hotel, for thepurpose of inserting an iron bar from which a sign was to be swung. Mr.Haden remonstrated at being disturbed. The two mechanics answered thatthey were on that job and that they were going to do it. Then, asthe _Detroit Free Press_ related the incident, the elderly gentleman,dressed in night-clothes and a nightcap, had pushed out both his arms,seized the offending and disturbing crowbar, hauled it into his roomand shut down the window. Very soon after, the proprietor of the hotelcame, knocked at his guests door, and said that the crowbar which hadbeen seized was not his property and that he would get into trouble ifit were not given up at once, but Seymour Haden before giving it upstipulated that he was not to be disturbed with any more noise untilsuch time as he was ready to leave his bed.It will be noticed that, while in my former article I called him SirSeymour Haden, in the present one I call him plain Mister. This wasbecause it was after his return from America to England that QueenVictoria gave him his title, and although in London he had a largemedical practice he never was even Doctor Haden. In England a surgeon,however eminent, is never addressed as Doctor.[Illustration: HADEN. AN EARLY RISEREngraved in pure mezzotint in 1897.

To this I made answer: But, Mr. Haden, in America wehave no lower classes. What you suffered from these people was reallyyour own fault. It is all very well in England for a fine gentleman tobully and denounce the cabman, the railway-porter, and the servants athotels, but it will not do here, and no American, however eminent, everdoes it.When Seymour Haden returned to England he took with him the genuinegood will of many Americans, and the lasting friendship of not a few.THE WATER-COLORS AND DRAWINGS OF SIR SEYMOUR HADEN, P.R.E.BY H. NAZEBY HARRINGTONAuthor of The Engraved Work of Sir Francis Seymour Haden, P.R.E.As an etcher the work of Sir Seymour Haden is known to all lovers ofart the wide world over, and not least in the United States, but hisgeneral capacity as an artist in other forms of expression is less wellknown, partly from lack of opportunity and partly from the very limitedamount of material.It must never be forgotten that art was not the main business of hislife; it was but an occasional and fitful relaxation in a life devotedto another profession and full of other and varied interests. Thewonder is, not that his artistic work was so limited, but that it wasso great and so successful.When a medical student in Paris, instead of spending his evenings inthe usual frivolities of the Quartier Latin, he attended the classesof the Government School of Art, which were held in the same buildingas the School of Medicine. This was done, not from any positive lovefor art, but rather with the fixed idea that such study would trainhis powers of observation and make the hands more alert to obey theimpulses of the will, and in this way help him in his surgical work.What he dissected he drew, what he drew he modeled, and in this wayobtained a remarkable knowledge of anatomy and some facility in thetechnique of graphic art.In this way he got into the habit of using drawing as a sort ofshorthand, and so, when in 1844 he traveled in Italy, his diaries werefilled with sketches rather than verbal descriptions--sketches thatunfortunately have been too generously scattered.While in Italy he met, and spent some time in the company of, Duval leCamus, a capable French artist who painted a good deal in water-color,and from him no doubt he picked up some knowledge of that medium.In Naples and its neighborhood they spent many happy days sketchingtogether.During the next fourteen or fifteen years Seymour Haden had not muchtime for the practice of art. His professional work took up all histime and vigor, but he always took a great interest in art and artistsand counted many artists among his friends. He was appointed Surgeonto the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, and becamea collector of etchings by the old masters, not merely for the sakeof acquisition but rather for the purpose of study and comparison. Healso became the possessor of many pictures and water-color drawings,amongst others of several by Turner; and so, when in 1858 his youngbrother-in-law J. M. Whistler returned from France with his recentlyetched plates and his inciting tales of work in the Paris studios,Haden became readily infected and took up etching again, with theresult we all know. Thenceforward, whenever a rare afternoonsholiday could be stolen, or a few moments spared between the casts ofthe line during the annual vacation devoted to fishing, or on therarer occasions of a continental holiday, the copper plate or thesketching block was brought into use. And so we find sketches doneon the Thames and the Ribble, the Teivy, the Test and the Spey; inHolland and in Germany, in Spain and Madeira; at Chatsworth, in theold towns of Rye and Winchelsea, and above all in the fascinating Isleof Purbeck--sketches done for his own pleasure or for his friends,with never a thought of placing them before either the critic or thepurchaser.The earliest sketch that I have seen is one dated 1841. It is inpen and sepia and represents an early morning execution outside theOld Bailey. At a first glance it might be mistaken for an etchingby Cruikshank. It measures only three and one half by two and onefourth inches, but is masterly in its drawing, and marvelous in itssuggestiveness of a large crowd.The drawings done in 1844 in France and Italy vary from mere thumb-nailsketches to comparatively finished drawings. Some of them in theircarefulness and decision resemble the early drawings of Turner. Twoor three figure sketches, notably portraits of Duval le Camus and theMarquis de Belluno (two of his companions), are very expressive andfull of character.While in Rome, through the introduction of the Marquis de Belluno,Haden had many interviews with Pope Gregory XVI, and during two orthree of them he took the opportunity of sketching, on one of his shirtcuffs, a somewhat elaborate portrait of His Holiness. The Pope verykindly professed not to notice what the artist was doing until theportrait was finished. He then quietly remarked that he now understoodwhy M. Haden had attended at three audiences without a change oflinen. One would give much to see this portrait (which Sir Seymouralways said was an excellent one), but it has disappeared, having beenlent to a friend and never returned.[Illustration: HADEN. SALMON POOL ON THE SPEYSize of the original charcoal drawing, 14  20 inches][Illustration: HADEN. OLD OAKS, CHATSWORTHSize of the original charcoal drawing, 14  20 inches]The drawings done after 1858 were much broader in style than the earlysketches, and vary in method, being in lead pencil, pen and ink, chalk,charcoal, and water-color. Thrown off in a moment of inspiration, as apoet would throw off a lyric, he chose the material which chanced to beat hand. Some are on sheets of writing paper, and many valuable onesare on perishable blotting paper. Here and there among these slightsketches are specimens that in their economy of line, their stamp ofdecision, and their interpretative insight, suggest the work of hisgreat master Rembrandt. What strikes one above all is their vigor andbigness. There is no dainty indecision about them; they go straightfor the heart of the subject, giving the vigorous impression of avigorous mind. They do not give all that could be said on the subject,but they give all that he feels is best worth saying. They make anintellectual appeal to the mind and do not tire with unnecessaryplatitudes.The water-color drawings show a good but scarcely a great colorist.They are in the grand manner and the best of them have a fineatmospheric quality, as in the _Dinkley Ferry_ here, which reminds oneof a good De Wint. The _Course of the Ribble_ is probably one of themost finished drawings he ever did, and shows to the highest degree ofwhat he was capable in this medium when time allowed and when lovingcare was exercised. It is wonderfully mellow, good in color, and truein drawing, but has less of the white heat of inspiration:--I envy thefortunate possessor! The _Lancashire River_, a drawing of the samesubject as the etching with the same title, is perhaps his finest pieceof color.But it is in his large charcoal drawings of the end of the seventiesthat he rises to his greatest heights,--in the sketches done aroundSwanage in the south of Dorsetshire, and at Chatsworth, and two orthree drawn from the stores of his memory. What a revelation it wasto me when--I scarcely like to count how many years ago--I firstpassed into that peaceful little garden room that looked out uponthe old-time bowling green at Woodcote Manor and saw around its wallssome four and twenty of these large charcoal drawings! It was asthough some new planet swam into my ken! I had never seen so muchsuggested with such simple means. Two or three hours work with a sheetof rough paper, a piece of charcoal, and a mezzotint scraper! Heathand woodland, sea cliff and river glen, radiant light and quiveringmist, houses sleeping in the sun and mysterious shadows lurking in thecorners of the quaint old kitchen or the romantic ruin, or lying fulllength before the giant boles of centuries-old oaks; all suggested withequal ease and magic mastery! Many and many an hour did I afterwardspend in that little treasure-house, ever finding fresh beautiesrevealed to me, and learning through them to see in Nature much thathad previously been hidden from me. Hadens etchings had proved himto be a great master in line, these drawings proved him to be almostequally great in tone. What particularly strikes one is the varietyand transparency of his shadows. They are not black patches, butreceding planes of varying densities. And what atmospheric quality theyhave! Driving mist and slanting rain, and sun rays penetrating themoisture-laden air, as though by a magician, are fixed for us on paper.[Illustration: HADEN. COURSE OF THE RIBBLE BELOW PRESTONSize of the original water-color, 12  19 inches][Illustration: HADEN. DINKLEY FERRYSize of the original water-color, 10  16 inches]The origin of many of these drawings has been described by Sir Seymourhimself in an article written some years ago in _Harpers Magazine_,On the Revival of Mezzotint as a Painters Art. With the idea that hecould use mezzotint as he had done etching, face to face with Nature,he had taken a previously grounded plate to the bank of the River Testand attempted to scrape upon it what he saw before him. The resultwas the plate numbered 234 in my catalogue (_The Test at LongparishNo. 3_), interesting, but not wholly satisfactory and incomplete inintention. This proved that, unlike etching, mezzotint was too slowa process with which to work from nature at a single sitting, and areturn on a later day only proved that the natural effect had changed,or that the artist was in a different phase of mind or not in thehumor to complete the original impression. So instead of taking agrounded plate out with him he took a sheet of rough paper which hadbeen rubbed all over with charcoal, this black surface correspondingto the mezzotint ground upon the copper plate, and on this preparedsurface he scraped away the lights. As will be readily understood,this softer material could be much more rapidly manipulated than theharder copper, and so he found that in two or three hours the desiredeffect could be obtained. His intention was to reproduce in the studioand at his leisure the effects of these studies upon the copper plate.And so, with modifications, in several instances he did--I say _withmodifications_, for it was almost impossible for him to closely copyeven his own work. The _Salmon Pool on the Spey_ provided the _motif_for the mezzotint plate with the same title (H. 250), and more closelyof the little _Salmon River_, which served as a frontispiece to Dr.Hamiltons book on Fly Fishing. The _Encombe Woods_ supplied thesubject for the two plates H. 218 and 219, which were intended tobe a combination of etching and mezzotint, but the latter part ofthe project was never carried out. This too was the case with _EarlyMorning_ (H. 244) and _By the Waters of Babylon_ (H. 245), _Ars Longa,Vita Brevis_ (H. 210) and _A Study of Rocks_ (H. 211), all of whichwere etched or dry-pointed from charcoal drawings. The only importantplates inspired by these drawings that were fully completed, were_Evening Fishing, Longparish_ (H. 239), _An Early Riser_ (H. 240),_Grayling Fishing_ (H. 241), and _The Pillar of Salt_ (H. 246); butthey are sufficient to prove what a series of masterpieces we havelost through the dimming of the eye and the numbing of the hand byrelentless Age.[Illustration: HADEN. ENCOMBE WOODSSize of the original charcoal drawing, 14  20 inches][Illustration: HADEN. AN ELDERLY COUPLE, CHATSWORTH PARKSize of the original charcoal drawing, 13  19 inches]However, we must be thankful for what we have, and the regret onehas that these drawings should be scattered in different directions,is tempered by the hope that by one of the marvelous photographicprocesses of to-day this wonderful series of visions may be reproduced,and so again brought together for all of us who love beautiful things,and who reverence the master who produced them.MERYON AND BAUDELAIREBY WILLIAM ASPENWALL BRADLEYAll French poets of the middle part of the nineteenth century wereinterested, theoretically at least, in painting and the graphicarts, which afforded them an ideal and an example of objectivity fortheir own verbal representations of reality. From Thophile Gautier,godfather of Parnassianism, who reserved for his prose the fullresources of his superb Turneresque palate, to Verlaine, creatorof decadence, with his limpid and lovely _aquarelles_, pictorialpreoccupations were, on the whole, paramount. Charles Baudelairealmost alone appears, in part, an exception to this rule; but if, inhis work, the purely visual element is less pronounced than in thatof most of his contemporaries--if the images of sight yield therein number and in clear evocative power to those of sound and ofscent, thereby preluding the way for a new poetic dispensation--henevertheless fits into the late romantic tradition, if only by reasonof his keen sthetic appreciation of the arts of design, and of hisassociation, as a disinterested friend or sympathetic critic, withmany of the most illustrious artists of the age. Himself a rebel andan outlaw in the domain of orthodox taste, though with a distincttinge of the traditional, he was especially drawn to the insurgentleader, like Delacroix, his championship of whom is as famous as hisespousal of the cause of Wagners music in Paris, or to the solitary_attard_ of romanticism who, like Constantin Guys, worked out hisown salvation in his own way. It is not that he did not welcome newmovements in all their collectivity of talents and temperaments; butthese, to find favor with him, must be vouched for by unmistakableevidences of creative vigor and originality in the individual artists,not merely by plausible theories or pretentious dogmas professedscholastically. Intellectual distinctions counted but little with himin matters of art, and a new way of rendering what was actually seenor felt seemed to him of infinitely more importance than any merelyacademic discussion as to what an artist should or should not look for,deliberately, in order to put it into or leave it out of his pictures.Thus it was that while he shrugged his shoulders at the realists whowere not really observers, he turned an attentive eye to the work ofthe group of young painter-etchers who, about 1859, were beginning toattract attention in the salons. Baudelaire thought highly of etchingbecause it afforded an opportunity for the most clean-cut possibletranslation of the character of the artist, and he was attractedto those who were engaged in reviving this almost obsolete medium,because they gave clear proof in their work of that personal force anddistinction which he valued above all else, and which he was always onthe alert to discover in the productions of the new and the unknown.In his article, _Peintres et Aqua-fortistes_, included in the volumeof his collected works entitled _LArt Romantique_, Baudelairementions the following etchers as among those through whose effortsthe medium was to recover its ancient vitality: Seymour Haden, Manet,Legros, Bracquemond, Jongkind, Meryon, Millet, Daubigny, Saint-Marcel,Jacquemart, and Whistler. With at least two of these, on the evidenceof his published correspondence,[2] he had personal relations:Bracquemond and Meryon. The name of the former occurs frequently in theletters with reference to a device which Baudelaire wished to adopt asa frontispiece to the second edition of _Fleurs du Mal_. The idea ofthis device came to him, as he writes to Flix Nadar (May 16, 1859),while turning the leaves of the _Histoire des Danses Macabres_, byHyacinthe Langlois. It was to be an arborescent skeleton, the legsand the ribs forming the trunk, the arms extended in the form of across breaking into leaf and shoot, and protecting several rows ofpoisonous plants arranged in rising tiers of pots, as in a greenhouse.In casting about for an artist to execute this design, Baudelairementions and dismisses Dor, Penguilly--whom he afterward wished hehad taken--and Clestin Nanteuil. Finally, perhaps at the instance ofhis publisher, Poulet-Malassis, he chose Bracquemond,--a most unhappyselection as it turned out, for that artist was either unable orunwilling to grasp the poets conception, and the plate which he etchedfor this purpose was not used. A few proofs were pulled, however, andimpressions in both the first and second states of the plate are nowin the Samuel P. Avery collection in the New York Public Library.[2] Charles Baudelaire: Lettres, 1841-1866. Paris, 1907.[Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. FRONTISPIECE FOR LES FLEURS DU MAL OFBAUDELAIREThe seven plants symbolize the Seven Deadly Sins, and the outstretchedarms of the skeleton will support, later, the Fruits of Evil. Thisromantic and remarkable frontispiece was never used. Baudelairecriticized the drawing of the skeleton severely, as well as the spiritand arrangement of the whole design.Size of the original etching, 6  4 inches][Illustration: PORTRAIT OF CHARLES BAUDELAIREFrom the etching by Flix Bracquemond. Of the same size as the originaletching. Evidently an excellent likeness, since it exactly renders thatecclesiastical aspect of the poet which made one of his friends comparehim to a cardinal.]Baudelaires negotiations with the terrible Bracquemond, as he cameto call him, were carried on for the most part through Poulet-Malassis,which perhaps affords a partial explanation of the misunderstandingconcerning the _macabre_ frontispiece. And, although he speaks in oneletter of having met the artist and repeated verbally the instructionswhich he had already given, with characteristically minute attention todetail, in writing, no such special interest attaches to this meeting,by no means unique, as to that between Baudelaire and Meryon whichoccurred about the same time, and to which we owe one of the most vividand fantastic presentments we possess of that mad genius. In his _Salonof 1859_, Baudelaire had written of Meryon with an enthusiasm whichawoke a responsive reverberation in the breast of Victor Hugo.Since you know M. Meryon, the latter wrote to Baudelaire (April 29,1860), tell him that his splendid etchings have dazzled me. Withoutcolor, with nothing save shadow and light, chiaroscuro pure and simpleand left to itself: that is the problem of etching. M. Meryon solves itmagisterially. What he does is superb. His plates live, radiate, andthink. He is worthy of the profound and luminous page with which he hasinspired you.This page, which Baudelaire afterward incorporated in his _Peintres etAqua-fortistes_, where he speaks further of Meryon as the true type ofthe accomplished _aqua-fortiste_, and praises the famous perspectiveof San Francisco as his masterpiece, does, indeed, betray the subtlepenetration of the poet into the very spirit of his fellow-artist:By the severity, the delicacy, and the certitude of his design, M.Meryon recalls what is best in the old _aqua-fortistes_. I have rarelyseen represented with more poetry the natural solemnity of a greatcapital. The majesties of accumulated stone, _the spires pointing afinger to the skies_, the obelisks of industry vomiting their thickclouds of smoke heavenward, the prodigious scaffoldings of monumentsunder repair, relieved against the solid mass of architecture, theirtracery of a filmy and paradoxical beauty, the misty sky, charged withwrath and with rancor, the depths of the perspectives augmented by thethought of the dramas contained therein,--none of the complex elementsof which the dolorous and glorious setting of civilization is composedis here forgotten.Grateful for such recognition on the part of a distinguished man ofletters who was also accepted as one of the leading art critics of theday in Paris, Meryon evidently wrote to Baudelaire, thanking him, andasking permission to call; for in his letter of January 8, 1860, toPoulet-Malassis, the poet writes as follows:What I write to-night, he begins, is worth the trouble of writing:M. Meryon has sent me his card, and we have met. He said to me: _Youlive in a hotel whose name must have attracted you, because of therelation it bears, I presume, to your tastes._--Then I looked at theenvelope of his letter. On it was Htel de _Thbes_, and yet hisletter reached me.[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF CHARLES MERYONFrom the etching by Flix Bracquemond, done in 1853Size of the original etching, 8/  6 inches][Illustration: MERYON. LE PONT AU CHANGEIn one of his great plates, he has substituted for a little balloona flight of birds of prey, and, when I remarked to him that it waslacking in verisimilitude to put so many eagles into a Parisian sky,he replied that what he had done was not devoid of foundation in fact,since _ces gens-l_ [the imperial government] had often released eaglesso as to study the presages, according to the rite,--and that this hadbeen printed in the newspapers, even in _Le Moniteur_.Charles Baudelaire in a letter to Poulet-Malassis (January 8, 1860).]It is necessary to interrupt the letter at this point to explainwhat is obscure in the foregoing allusion for one not familiar withBaudelaires haunts and homes in Paris. He was living at this time,not in the Htel Pimodan where he dwelt so long, and where he heldthose famous meetings described by Gautier in his introductory essayto _Fleurs du Mal_, but in modest quarters in the Hotel de Dieppe, 22,rue dAmsterdam, whose principal advantage was its proximity to theGare de lOuest whence he took the train for Honfleur on his frequentvisits to his mother. Thus, through a bizarre confusion between the twowords, _Dieppe_ and _Thbes_, is explained Meryons curious mistake inaddressing his letter to Baudelaire.The poet proceeds with the following report of their conversation: Inone of his great plates,[3] he [Meryon] has substituted for a littleballoon a flight of birds of prey, and, when I remarked to him that itwas lacking in verisimilitude to put so many eagles into a Parisiansky, he replied that what he had done was not devoid of foundation infact, since _ces gens-l_ [the imperial government] had often releasedeagles so as to study the presages, according to the rite,--and thatthis had been printed in the newspapers, even in _Le Moniteur_.[3] The _Pont-au-Change_.I must tell you that he makes no attempt to conceal his respect forall superstitions, but he explains them badly, and he sees cabaleverywhere.He drew my attention to the fact, in another of his plates, that theshadows cast by one of the masonry constructions of the _Pont-Neuf_[4]on the lateral wall of the quay represented exactly the profile of asphinx; that this had been, on his part, quite involuntary, and that hehad only remarked this singularity later, on recalling that this designhad been made a short time before the _coup dtat_. But the Princeis the real person who, by his acts and his visage, bears the closestresemblance to a _sphinx_.[4] An error of Baudelaires. The plate is the _Petit-Pont_.He asked me if I had read the tales of a certain Edgar Poe. I answeredthat I knew them better than any one else, and for a good reason. Hethen asked me in a very emphatic manner, if I believed in the realityof this Edgar Poe. I naturally asked him to whom he attributed allhis tales. He replied: _To a society of men of letters who are veryclever, very powerful, and who are in touch with everything._ Andhere is one of his reasons: The _Rue_ Morgue. _I have made a designof the_ Morgue.--_An_ Orang-ou-tang. _I have often been comparedto_ a monkey.--_This monkey murders_ two women, a mother and herdaughter. _I also have morally assassinated_ two women, a mother andher daughter.--_I have always taken the story as an allusion to mymisfortunes. You would be doing me a great favor if you could find outfor me the date when Edgar Poe, supposing that he was not helped by anyone, composed this story, so that I could see if the date coincidedwith my adventures._He spoke to me, with admiration, of Michelets book on _Jeanne dArc_,but he is convinced that this book is not by Michelet.One of his great preoccupations is cabalistical science, but heinterprets it in a strange fashion that would make a cabalist laugh.[Illustration: MERYON. LE PETIT PONTHe drew my attention to the fact, in another of his plates, that theshadows cast by one of the masonry constructions of the Pont-Neuf onthe lateral wall of the quay represented exactly the profile of asphinx; that this had been, on his part, quite involuntary, and that hehad only remarked this singularity later, on recalling that this designhad been made a short time before the _coup dtat_.Charles Baudelaire in a letter to Poulet-Malassis (January 8, 1860).Size of the original etching, 9  7 inches][Illustration: PORTRAIT OF CHARLES MERYONFrom the drawing by Lopold Flameng, made in May, 1858, in Meryonsroom in the rue des Fosss-Saint-Jacques, the night before Meryonbecame dangerously mad and was taken by his friends, in a cab, toCharenton for the first time. Later he was discharged, and took uphis lodging in the rue Duperr, and in October, 1866, returned toCharenton, where he died in February, 1868.]Do not laugh at all this with _mchants bougres_. For nothing in theworld would I wish to injure a man of talent....After he left me, I asked myself how it happened that I, who havealways had, in my mind and in my nerves, all that was needed to makeme mad, had not become so. Seriously, I addressed to heaven thethanksgivings of the Pharisee.       *       *       *       *       *It is not surprising that Baudelaire should have been somewhatdisconcerted by this interview which confirmed so strikingly thereports of the mental malady of his visitor to which he had alluded inhis _Salon of 1859_, and that he should soon have sought, after somebrief intercourse, to avoid personal and private encounters which mighthave proved embarrassing. He gave notice in ways the artist could notlong mistake, that he did not wish to continue the acquaintance on afooting of intimacy, though, as Crpet, in his _Charles Baudelaire_[5]points out, he by no means ceased to interest himself in the artist,several sets of whose _Eaux-Fortes sur Paris_ he was instrumental,with one or two other admirers of Meryon, in having purchased by theMinistry. Poor Meryon! With an incomplete realization of his owncondition which rendered him incapable of divining the real truth, hefelt he had offended Baudelaire in some way, and finally addressedhim the following appeal, tragic in its note of noble and unconsciouspathos:[5] Charles Baudelaire: tude biographique dEugne Crpet revue etmise au jour par Jacques Crpet. Paris, 1907. _Dear Sir_: I called on you yesterday evening at the Htel de Dieppe. I was informed that you had changed your domicile. I wished, above all, to see you, in order to learn from your own lips that you were not angry with me, for I do not think I have ever done anything to you which could serve as a motive for your change of manner toward me. Only, as the last letter which I wrote you has remained unanswered, and as three times I have left my name at your dwelling without my having had the slightest word from you, I am entitled to believe that you have some reason for breaking with me. I did not remind you of your promise to write a newspaper article about my work, because, quite frankly, I was sure that you could make much better employment of your time and of your literary skill. My etchings are known to nearly all whom they could interest and rather too much good has been said of them. As to the interruption of our relations, which have been but of brief duration and of slight importance, I agree to this without a word if such is your desire, and I shall conserve, none the less, the recollection of the eminent services you have rendered me in coming to see me, and in occupying yourself with me at a time when I was utterly destitute. I have forwarded to M. Lavielle, whom I had the advantage of meeting once with you, the set of my views, reworked and a trifle modified; he has, perhaps, shown them to you. I have had difficulty in procuring the ten sets of them (the printer being very busy at that time) that I have disposed of with sufficient rapidity. I have no longer any left and I have destroyed the _Petit-Pont_, which I propose to engrave anew, after I have made in it some rather important corrections. Adieu, dear sir, with all possible good wishes. I am your sincere and devoted friend, C. MERYON. 20, rue Duperr.The letter to which Meryon refers in the opening paragraph of theforegoing as having remained unanswered by Baudelaire is doubtless thatbearing the date of February 23, 1860, which is the only other onegiven by Crpet in the appendix to his volume. This is it: _Dear Sir_: I send you a set of my Views of Paris.[6] As you can see, they are well printed, on Chinese tissue mounted on laid paper, and consequently _de bonne tenue_. It is on my part a feeble means of recognizing the devotion you have shown on my behalf. However, I dare hope that they will serve sometimes to fix your imagination, curious of the things of the past. I myself, who made them at an epoch, it is true, when my nave heart was still seized with sudden aspirations toward a happiness which I believed I could attain, look over some of these pieces with a veritable pleasure. They may, then, be able to produce nearly the same effect upon you who also love to dream. I have not yet terminated the notes that I promised to make in order to aid you in your work; at all events, I shall go to see you soon to discuss the matter with you further. As the publisher recoils before the steps which would still have to be taken, he says, for the placing of these prints, there is nothing pressing about the affair. Thus, do not let this disturb you. Adieu, monsieur; I hope that before your departure, I shall be able to profit by the kindly reception that I have received from you. I am your very humble and very devoted servant. I am going to try to place sets with those persons who have been so good, on your recommendation, as to interest themselves in this work. MERYON. 20, rue Duperr.[6] Baudelaire had already tried to obtain a set of these prints. Inwriting to Charles Asselineau (February 20, 1859) he commissions hisfriend to get from douard Houssaye all the engravings of Meryon(views of Paris), good proofs on Chinese paper. _Pour parer notrechambre_, as Dorine says. He was not successful, however, at thattime. In quoting Molire, Baudelaire refers to Toinettes speech in _LeMalade Imaginaire_ (Act II slc v).This letter renders sufficiently clear the kind of service Baudelairehad rendered Meryon over and above the public praise contained in hiswritings. What, at the first glance, is less certain is the work onwhich the poet was engaged at this time and for which Meryon, on hisown testimony, had promised to assist him with notes. In a foot-noteto this letter, M. Jacques Crpet states that it was doubtless_Leau-forte est  la mode_, an anonymous article published by the_Revue anecdotique_ in the latter half of April, 1862. Personally,I doubt the correctness of this conjecture. One has but to turn toBaudelaires letters of the period to see that there was then underdiscussion another piece of work for which Meryon would have been muchmore likely to give assistance in the form of notes, since it directlyconcerned himself. Indeed, the matter almost amounted to a project ofcollaboration between Meryon and Baudelaire. The publisher Deltre hadpromised to bring out an album of the Vues de Paris, and had askedthe poet to prepare some text for the plates. The first reference tothis tentative undertaking occurs in Baudelaires letter of February16, 1860 (just a week before Meryons), to Poulet-Malassis:And then Meryon!--he broaches the matter abruptly, after havingexpressed his impatience at the attitude of two other artists,Champfleury and Duranty, friends of his, toward Constantin Guys, andat a certain note of pedantry and dogmatism that was stealing into artunder the influence and sanction of realism--And then Meryon! Oh, asfor him, it is intolerable. Deltre asks me to write some text for thealbum. Good! there is an occasion to write some reveries--ten lines,twenty or thirty lines--on beautiful engravings, the philosophicalreveries of a Parisian _flaneur_. But Meryon, whose idea is different,objects. I am to say: on the right you see this; on the left you seethat. I must say: here originally there were twelve windows, reduced tosix by the artist, and finally I must go to the Htel de Ville to findout the exact epoch of the demolitions. M. Meryon talks, his eyes fixedon the ceiling, and without listening to any observation.Thus it was historical and antiquarian notes that, in all probability,Meryon had promised to jot down to facilitate the composition ofa running commentary on the etchings. Meryons reference to thereluctance of the publisher in the very same paragraph in whichhe speaks of these notes, serves to remove the least doubt as towhat is meant. When he tells Baudelaire not to be disturbed, it isclearly as to the time at his disposal for the preparation of histext. Baudelaire, however, seems to have been less concerned abouthis own share in the work than about the fate of the project as awhole. Evidently he was not satisfied at the prospects of the workwith Deltre, for, on March 9, 1860, he wrote in a postscript toPoulet-Malassis:I turn my letter, to ask you, very seriously, if it would not beadvisable for you to be the publisher of Meryons album (which willbe augmented) and for which I am to write the text. You know that,unfortunately, this text will not be in accordance with my wishes.I warn you that I have made overtures to the house of Gide....This Meryon does not know how to go about things; he knows nothingof life. He does not know how to sell; he does not know how to find apublisher. His work is readily salable.And again, on March 13, he writes, in response to some proposition fromhis friend:Relative to Meryon, do you mean by _buying the plates_ to buy themetal plates, or rather the right of selling an indefinite numberof proofs from them? I can conceive that you fear the conversationswith Meryon. You should carry on the negotiations by letter (20, rueDuperr). I warn you that Meryons great fear is lest the publishershould change the format and the paper.... What you say to me ofMeryon does not affect what I write to you concerning him.The excellent business sense, the note of prudence and painstaking,that comes out in all this correspondence on the part of Baudelaire,and which is scarcely less notable than his unwearied devotion to theinterests of his friends, ought to go far toward discountenancing thetheory that a poet cannot be a good man of affairs. Still again hewrites on the same subject, with recapitulations of what he had saidbefore, to the same correspondent:I am very much embarrassed, _mon cher_, to reply to you relatively tothe Meryon affair. I have no rights in the matter whatsoever; M. Meryonhas repulsed, with a species of horror, the idea of a text composedof a dozen little poems or sonnets; he has refused the idea of poeticmeditations in prose. So as not to wound him, I have promised to writefor him, in return for three copies with the good proofs, a text in thestyle of a guide or manual, unsigned. It is, therefore, with him alonethat you will have to treat.... The thing has presented itself to mymind very simply. On one side, an unfortunate madman, who does not knowhow to conduct his affairs, and who has executed a beautiful work; onthe other, you, on whose list I want to see the best books possible. Asthe journalists say, I have considered for you the double pleasure of agood bit of business and of a good act. And he compares Meryons casewith that of Daumier, then without a publisher, to wind whom up, likea clock, would also, he tells Poulet-Malassis, be a great and goodbit of business.This is the last reference in any of the letters to Meryon, or to thealbum, for which Baudelaire never wrote his text, since no publisherwas willing to publish the work. Had Poulet-Malassis not failed in1861, it might have appeared, and then, in spite of the restrictionsimposed upon the restive spirit of the poet, we might have had inBaudelaires text some literary equivalent of Meryons etchings. Howsympathetic this would have been, is shown by the descriptive andinterpretative passage from the _Salon de 1859_ already quoted, which,in a few sentences, completely defines the form of Meryons imaginativegenius, and reveals the inmost source of its power to stir the emotions.There was, indeed, much that was common to the genius of Meryon andof Baudelaire. The work of both was profoundly personal, and in botha powerful and somber imagination was tinged with a subtle fantasysupplied by a morbid exaggeration in the senses, which did not,however, preclude an intense and ardent preoccupation with formalperfection.On the contrary, these two modern _dtraqus_ present in their work asolidity of construction and an absolute rectitude in the renderingof their moods and dreams, that is scarcely to be found in the workof even their best-balanced and sanest contemporaries. The art ofBaudelaire has been compared to that of Racine, and, in the same way,Meryons design has the complete economy and control of Robert Nanteuilor of Callot. Men like these make us doubt and reconsider our stockdistinctions of romantic and classic. The work of Meryon and ofBaudelaire answers equally to both descriptions, and assures them aplace apart in their generation. Thus, while their paths crossed butfor a moment, and while they never shared with each other their secretthoughts and aspirations, there is, nevertheless, no small interest forthe student in these slight and fragmentary records of what, had itnot been for a cruel freak of fate, might have proved an enduring andfruitful friendship.FLIX BRACQUEMOND: AN ETCHER OF BIRDSBY FRANK WEITENKAMPFChief of the Department of Prints, New York Public LibraryEven the artist of various interests actively expressed,--theversatile artist, if that adjective be used without the suspicion ofsuperficiality which is often its aftertaste--is very apt to becomeassociated in the public mind with some one specialty.Flix Bracquemond is known particularly well as an etcher of birds. Yethe has done many things, more than one well enough to have establisheda reputation. At twenty he painted, and exhibited at the Salon of 1853,a portrait of himself, in a manner that carries you back to Holbein,that even faintly suggests the spirit of Van Eyck in its precise anddetailed utterance. The portrait clearly indicates his future activity,for he holds in his hand a bottle of acid, while etching tools lie ona table near him. His etched portraits are numerous, and include suchcomparatively free productions as the ones of Legros and of Meryon, andthe large, minutely finished one of Edmond de Goncourt. The last namedis a characteristic and typical example of Bracquemonds art, which,even when most painstaking, somehow or other never seems labored.Bracquemond appears as a peculiar and interesting mingling ofTeutonic thoroughness and Gallic _esprit_.[Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. DUCKS AT PLAYSize of the original etching, 12  9 inches][Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. A FLOCK OF TEAL ALIGHTINGSize of the original etching, 12  9 inches]The characteristic elements in his portraits--robustness, versatilityand a resourceful mastery of technique--are peculiar to all hiswork. The same artist who carefully and with honest and sympatheticadaptation translated such different products of painters personalityas Millets _Man with the Hoe_ and Meissoniers _La Rixe_, as well ascanvases and drawings by Holbein (the magisterial portrait of Erasmus),Corot, Gustave Moreau, Gavarni and Delacroix, also, under Japaneseinfluence, etched numerous designs for ceramic ware (he was for a timea sort of artist director at the Haviland factory at Limoges), fishesand birds in swirling, decorative outline. In contrast to these lastnamed are his numerous well-finished pictures of birds and mammals. Hishares, moles and mice done with loving emphasis on the texture of theirfurry pelts. (The vision of happy days, seen by poor bunny suspendedby one leg, was reproduced as far afield as Poland, in _TygdnikIllustrowny_.) The birds, with the delightful and strong modeling oftheir bodies felt under the sleek surface of their feathery coverings.A master craftsman, he has found delight, like Buhot, Gurard andMielatz, in technical experiments, and his interest and skill inreproductive methods are illustrated in etchings, dry-points,aquatints, lithographs, photogravures retouched with etching,engravings in color, and plates showing combinations of processes.Burty once wrote: He contrives by repeated use of the acid on certainparts of the plate to get a black which for depth and intensity hasnever been equaled. And Meryon avowed of him: I cannot etch. Thatone, there, he is the true etcher.His active interests, and his all-embracing outlook on the life abouthim, found expression in such occasional productions as the etchingsof figures modeled in snow by French sculptors in Paris during theCommune; the symbolical lithograph of France defending himself againstthe Prussian eagle, while strangling his own imperial bird; the ceramiccompliment to Uncle Sam: _The Old World and Young America_, or thevery large plate done as a memorial tablet for Meryons coffin. Hishand recorded the placid, rural beauties of Bas Meudon and the quickimpression of a steamboat, amusingly described by Beraldi (see No.185). And a bit of woodland, possibly in the Bois de Boulogne, inwinter snows, in combination with a gaunt wolf probably studied at theJardin dAcclimatation (the Paris Zoo), gave him opportunity for hiseffective _Wolf in the Snow_, also known as _Winter_ (Beraldi No. 180),which in its spirit of desolation might be many hundred miles fromParis.And with all this, his etchings only have been spoken of here,--andthey are about 800 in number. But the catalogue (issued in an editionof 220 copies) of his work exhibited at the Socit Nationale desBeaux-Arts (Salon) in 1907, includes not only etchings, but paintings,water-colors, pastels and designs executed in embroidered silk,ceramics, iron, cloisonn enamel, jade, wood and bookbindings.[Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. PHEASANTS AT DAWN: MORNING MISTSSize of the original etching, 9  13 inches][Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. THE BATHER (CANARDS SURPRIS)Size of the original etching, 14  10 inches]Yet the late Walter S. Carter of Brooklyn, a most catholicprint-collector, ventured fearlessly on the inviting but notalways safe sliding pond of analogy, and proclaimed Bracquemond theMichelangelo of ducks. Without regard to the manner of the statement,we may accept the classification. For had Bracquemond never etchedanything but his bird plates, he would have won his place in the annalsof the fascinating art of needle and acid. Perhaps he realized thatwhen he furnished a title-page design for the third volume, devotedto himself, of Beraldis Graveurs du XIX Sicle, consisting solelyof a duck and a portfolio of prints. Much slighter in execution, butmore significantly allegorical, was his frontispiece (Beraldi No.480) for the catalogue of the second portion of the Burty collection.It represented a stand holding an open portfolio from which printsflying upward are gradually evolved into cranes. Ducks, however, haveapparently been his special delight. He has pictured them in action,as in the delightful oblong picture of two ducks swimming (BeraldiNo. 185) and in the equally, and amusingly, lifelike one of fiveducks swimming hurriedly to a central point of common interest. Orin allegorical attitude, as in the _Canard_ (Beraldi No. 116), theherald of fake news. He has observed the teal along the riversideand the _Gambols_ of ducks (Beraldi No. 221), done with a simple andsympathetic delight in the doings of these water-fowl. Hardly ever,perhaps, has he better characterized the useful bird whose call,onomatopoetically imitated, has long served to characterize medicalcharlatanry, than in the plate known as _The Bather_ or _Canardssurpris_. The three birds, who have come down to their accustomedswimming hole only to find it already occupied by a comely youngwoman, are alive and moving. The beholder can fairly see and heartheir wonder at the unwarranted intrusion on their rights, and regardstheir wagging tails with much of the fascination that Septimus andWiggleswick (in W. J. Lockes Septimus) felt in the same diversion.While the duck apparently appealed most to him, Bracquemond wasattracted also by other members of the family of _Aves_. The goose,cousin to the _Anas_, he showed collectively in _Geese in a Storm_(_The Storm Cloud._ Beraldi No. 219), which may be studied in the Averycollection at the New York Public Library, in a series of touchedproofs in which the fortuitous effect of gradually added work in thesky gives somewhat the impression of a storm rising as you look at theconsecutive proofs. _Ducks in a Marsh_ also move under a lowering sky,and in _Its Raining Pitchforks_ (Beraldi No. 212) the flood-gatesof heaven are fully opened, so that the water-fowl appear to findthemselves doubly in their element.[Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. GEESE IN A STORMSize of the original etching, 9  13 inches][Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. SEA-GULLSSize of the original etching, 10  18 inches]Bracquemond sometimes labored through a number of states on a plate.The large portrait of Edmond de Goncourt was patiently carried througha number of progressive proofs. And in the process of thus searchingfor ultimate satisfactoriness he may give us such pleasant surprisesas the fourth state of _Morning Mists_ (Beraldi No. 779), a pheasantpiece, with its delightful background addition of trees--an airy,light impression of early morning. He has done several landscapesof a lightness which approaches a Legros-like delicacy, so that itis perplexing to compare them with such a faithfully studied butsomewhat hard plate as that of the duck perplexed at sight of aturtle (_LInconnu_, Beraldi No. 174), and to realize that the samehand did both. Venturing still farther into the field of ornithology,he depicted golden pheasants, partridges, swallows, with sympathy forhis subject and an open eye for its artistic possibilities. The humanelement enters into these pictures very rarely, and then only whenabsolutely in place. So in _At the Jardin dAcclimatation_ (Beraldi No.214), in which two stylishly dressed young ladies are looking at goldenpheasants in an inclosure. Once, at least, in _Sea-gulls_ (Beraldi No.782), he felt and rendered the beautiful effect of a circling, glidingflight of gulls over rolling waves, in a graceful swirl of linescombining into a harmonious pattern.The peculiar effect of this last named plate, with its mingling ofJapanese and other influences, is in striking contrast to his early andmost remarkable _Haut dun battant de Porte_ (Beraldi No. 110, done atthe age of nineteen), in which the dead bodies of three birds of preyand a bat are shown nailed to a barn door, held up as a warning examplein a not too smoothly flowing quatrain. To his plates of moralizing oremblematic intention, such as the one just referred to, or the _Canard_(Beraldi No. 116), he delighted in adding such inscriptions, generallyin rhyme. His verses in such cases partake a little of the haltingmetre of those which poor Meryon attached to certain of his plates.Such etched letterpress additions appear also in _Margot la Critique_(Beraldi No. 113) and in _Le Corbeau_. The last named delineation ofan old bow-legged crow presents a creature so weird, so uncanny, thatwithout adventitious effects it appears as a symbol of some sinisterpower, felt though not realized. But a still more famous plate,because most strongly characteristic, is _The Old Cock_ (the originaldrawing for which is owned by Samuel P. Avery), a masterly portrait ofchanticleer, in all the dignity and pomp of his mature vigor and sereneself-sufficiency. Here is the poem for this:  H, vieux coq,  Vieux Don Juan,  Vieille voix, tu trailles,  Toi-mme tu seras  La pierre du festin fait  tes funerailles  Et les convives, las  De livrer  ta chair de trop rudes batailles  Se reposeront des dents et des bras  Racontant  lenvie, tes amours, tes combats.He japonized this magnificent fowl in a purely decorative spirit,without the psychological element. And on the occasion of the visitof the Russian fleet to Toulon in 1893, he repeated and emphasizedthe theme to the verge almost of the grotesque, in a representationof the Gallic cock, a Hercules of his kind, with the aggressivenessof conscious strength, trumpeting forth his _Vive le Tsar!_ withtriumphant enthusiasm. This emblematic use of ornithological specimenshas been already referred to in the case of the _Canard_. It appearsnotably also in _Margot la Critique_. The critic may note that _Margot_happens to be particularly unctuous in the state before the verses, butwill not be otherwise adversely influenced by this etched philippicagainst his brethren.[Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. THE OLD COCKBut a still more famous plate, because most strongly characteristic,is _The Old Cock_, a masterly portrait of chanticleer, in all thedignity and pomp of his mature vigor and serene self-sufficiency.Frank Weitenkampf, _Flix Bracquemond: An Etcher of Birds_.Size of the original etching, 11  9 inches][Illustration: BRACQUEMOND. SWALLOWS IN FLIGHTSize of the original etching, 12  10 inches]But besides these many realistic studies of bird life there are justabout as many of purely decorative interest, showing strong Japaneseinfluence, and mostly executed for ceramic decoration. There are alsodecorative combinations of _Reeds and Teal_, _Swallows_ flying ingraceful curves and swirls, _Lapwing and Teal_ swimming and flying.Here again we have an entirely different point of view. The lovingstudy of nature, sometimes expressed in an uncompromising hardness inthe reproduction of form or detail, or elsewhere in an almost playfullightness of touch in obedience to a passing mood, appears here withquite different results. Seemingly endless changes on the same themeof swirling, undulating curves of flying, running, strutting, swimmingbodies of birds and fishes delight the eye with the rhythmic flow ofever recurrent accent on the pure beauty of line.And at the end, when you have gone through the many portfolios ofBracquemonds work, there occurs to you his own statement quoted byClement Janin. It is to the effect that a work of graphic art must bearon its face, undisguised, the characteristics of the technique by whichit was produced. A lithograph must be a lithograph; a wood-engraving awood-engraving and not the imitation of an engraving on copper or of aphotograph. A review of the arts of reproduction proves that this isnot the truism it may seem. It is a basic principle in all art, andwill bear earnest and repeated emphasis. And the notable recognition ofthis fact by Bracquemond is a prime factor in his success in the artthat has meant so much to him.AUGUSTE LEPREBY ELISABETH LUTHER CARYArt Editor of the New York TimesIT is the fashion of the moment to specialize in art as in otherprofessions, and we no longer expect to find the multiple tendenciesand ambitions of a Leonardo or a Drer, or even of the self-containedRembrandt, in the modern artist. He is a painter or a sculptor or awood-engraver or an etcher. He is even more closely classified asa portrait- or a landscape-painter, an animalier or a decorator, adry-point engraver or a disciple of pure etching. If, as sometimeshappens, he escapes from the threads of the Lilliputians and swings hisarms in a wider sweep, it is in the mood of deprecation or excuse, as awriter may choose to whittle wood or hammer metal in order to clear hisword-fogged brain.There is, however, a wholesome and growing impression among thoughtfulobservers that extreme limitation and restriction produce weaknessrather than strength, and when we find an artist who has somethingof the ancient flexibility of mind and hand it is worth our while toacclaim him.[Illustration: LEPRE. RHEIMS CATHEDRALSize of the original etching, 14  10 inches][Illustration: LEPRE. BELLE MATINE. AUTOMNESize of the original etching, 7  11 inches]Auguste Lepre has pursued a free course of development, rounding hiscapacities, and forming himself with balanced and reasonable attentionto diversified interests. He was born in Paris in 1849. His fatherwas the talented sculptor Franois Lepre, and he got, no doubt, fromhis father something of the latters taste for suggesting passion, evenfrenzy, in small but monumental figures. While quite young he studiedwith the English engraver Smeeon, and spent his first professionalyears in the service of illustration for _Le Monde Illustr_,_LIllustration_, _Le Magasin Pittoresque_, and _La Revue Illustre_ inParis, the _Graphic_ and _Black and White_ in London, and _Scribners_and _Harpers_ in America.Tiring of this field, he tried all things. He became in turn ametal-chaser, a decorator of leathers, a ceramist, an etcher, awood-engraver and a painter. If we consider him chiefly as an etcher,it must be with the full appreciation that any craft mastered by him ismade subsidiary to the larger principles upon which all works of artare based, whatever the medium or process. He has consistently declinedto fritter away his admirable technique upon technicalities undertakenfor their own sake, and his work in etching as in painting is the workof an intellect concerned with the problems of rhythm and harmony,color, tone and form, which assail artists in every field.As an etcher he received his initiation from Bracquemond, the mostrobust of temperaments and at the same time the most fastidious oftechnicians. Lepre has been worthy of his teaching. From the first hehas sought to render his impression, recorded by a vision singularlyprompt and synthetic, with precise care, patiently assembling all thecomplex virtues of his method to the task. To his slightest plate hehas brought conscience and sincerity, and also a quality withoutwhich all the moral gifts with which human nature may be endowed wouldhave availed him nothing as an artist: the rare capacity, that is, forretaining the freshness of his vision throughout a slow process oftranslation.Before examining a few of his plates to discern their significantqualities, it will be interesting to consider his own words on the aimof the engraver: notes written with reference to the change in methodsof reproduction from interpretation by means of the engravers art tothe use of photography and the resultant processes. Even his notes onengraving for the purpose of reproduction, though less closely alliedto the work of his riper years than the notes on engraving from natureas an original art, are excellent reading, since they throw a clearlight upon his ideals and definite convictions:Formerly, he says, when an engraver had a work to reproduce, itwas _absolutely necessary for him to see it_. He could then studyit, comprehend it, and consequently extract its essential principle,simplify it, adapt it to his mode of expression, engrave it.If he had not the gift of composition, that of design was necessaryin order to make his transposition; that of interpretation, in orderto gather the idea of the creator of his model. His work was almostthe equal of the work of an original engraver who usually interprets acomposition or a model given by nature.His art was that of transposition. He took color or mass and madea song in a different key, keeping only the relative values of theshadows and lights and the contours of the objects.[Illustration: LEPRE. VUE DU PORT DE LA MEULESize of the original etching, 8  12 inches][Illustration: LEPRE. PEUPLIERS TTARDSSize of the original etching, 7  9 inches]Photography has come to change all that. It has facilitated the taskof the engraver, who, for the most part, has not even seen the works hereproduces. The science of design is almost reduced to knowing how totrace; as for simplifying a photograph, it can only make matters worse.Such as it is, a photograph forms a perfect gamut in which nothing canbe changed without losing everything; to extract a line from it isimpossible, so indiscernible is the passage from one object to another,a figure in the background, etc., etc.Photography is a reproduction; it becomes a betrayal. What is the copyinterpreted by this betrayal? How can one extract the character ofanything if the true model is not there?Here, then, is our engraver obliged to copy with his precise artfrom something quite vague. Photography sees the globs of color, theaccidents of a picture, with as much interest as the most beautifuldesign. What will he put in the place of these accidents? He traces, hecopies; and as the photograph is stupid, he copies a stupidity.He does this so thoroughly that he can be dispensed with, the meansof printing a photograph having been discovered. What imitates aphotograph most completely if not a photogravure? This attains to adegree of impersonality so great that the poor engraver can no longerbattle against it.For the engraver who possesses no faculty of composition to doartistic work it is necessary that he be an interpreter, a simplifier,with a very well-defined idea of the necessities of his craft, andthat he know how to draw directly! He must renounce all attemptsto overstep the boundaries of his craft; he must not try to expresscolors. One may, in an engraving, express cold and heat; that is,indeed, the main thing. But it is impossible to engrave red, yellow,or green. These are researches that encroach upon the domain of thepainter and spoil everything.Of the original engraver more is exacted. As a true artist hemust respect both his craft and the quality of his vision. Hemust synthetize, simplify, express, avoid photographic vision andtrivialities of style; he must employ only the means forbidden tophotography: those well-affirmed indications of the movements of thepoint which are the very foundation of the beautiful technique ofengraving.And in one phrase is summed up the essential aim of the engraverwho treats his art with respect, whether he uses it for purposes ofreproduction or for original work: Not to imitate. To express.Lepre has followed his own doctrine to its logical conclusion. Neverservile, even in his most faithful portraiture of a nature thatenchants him, he works with a plenitude of science, but also withunwearied freshness of inspiration and a sympathetic feeling for thecharacter of his subject, whether it is a curve of the river near NtreDame where horses come down to drink, or a poor mans hut with climbingvines in bloom, or the wide marshes of the Vende. With the passageof time his vision has grown larger and calmer, his interpretationsmagisterial; but in his most classic moments he does not forgetto infuse into his composition a strong feeling for this intimatecharacterization. He is a true creator, living not only above but inhis conception. He is at once serene and moved, in command of hisintellectual instrument and impelled by his personal interest.The _Journe dInventaire_ is a plate that shows clearly this doubleaction of the artists mind. The composition is stately in both lineand mass. In the background rises the lofty architecture of the AmiensCathedral; in the foreground, in deep shadow, is a group of figuresdiversely occupied. The upraised arms of these figures lead naturallyto the pointed arches and ascending spires. In a similar fashion, thestrong darks of the foreground mount in diminishing quantity throughthe heavy shadows in the recesses of the doorways to the luminousblacks that mark the slender openings in the towers. It is a beautifulupward movement that repeats the song of the Gothic spirit.These wonderful darks have also another function. Echoed as they are,in the small, sharp shadows of the multitudinous detail, they send thelight quivering all through the picture. It pours down from a sky emptyof clouds, and causes the web of decorative imagery with which thestructure is draped to shimmer like a fabric set with precious stones.Only a true master of the subtleties possible to interwoven dark andlight could thus command his atmospheric effect, and evoke from hisslight and restricted materials the grandeur of the immense pile ofstone raised by the hands of man, and the contrasting evanescence ofthe passing sunshine caressing every boss and hollow in the richlymanipulated surfaces. It is perhaps not too much to say that nothingmore remarkable in its kind has been done in the present century.The element of drama is added by the turmoil of little figures inshadow at the base of the cathedral, seen in minute detail throughthe translucent darkness and agitated by their human accidents andemotions. The whole spirit of France, its imperishable monuments, itssparkle of sunshine, its reasonable architecture, its vivid life, maybe inferred from this remarkable plate.Very different in sentiment and less close to perfection in therelation of the parts of the design to the whole, is _La Chte deBallon_; yet this also is a beautiful plate. As in the _JournedInventaire_, the eye is led upward by the gestures of the crowd inthe foreground to the point of interest, the balloon hung poised abovethe trees and houses. There is the same contrast of movement, too, inthe agitated figures of the foreground with the calm lines and clearlight of the distance. In this plate, however, is greater piquancy oflight and shade. The abrupt lines and minor episodes are carried so farinto the composition as to dominate the general impression, leavingthe open distance to play a secondary instead of primary part. Figuresare hurrying in excitement toward the scene of the arial drama; treebranches are tossing, there are little restless clouds passing rapidlyacross the sky; the air is brisk, it is a bright day, there is much tosee and do, and interest is keen--that is the story one carries awayfrom the handsome, stirring print, and also a subtle poetic suggestionthat beyond the town, as one follows the slow length of a white cliff,to where it meets the horizon, is a very great world that turns fromnight to day, from day to night, interminably, unchecked and unspeededby the passing storms of human glee and human woe.[Illustration: LEPRE.

LE NIDSize of the original etching, 6  6 inches]_La Seine  lEmbouchure du Canal Saint-Martin_ is more commonplacein subject, the river and its barges having entered into the artisticlife of nearly all French etchers; but how few could pass with suchsureness of plan, such precision of execution, from the dark bulkof the vessel in the lower left corner to the snapping black of thetree-top in the upper right corner, along a perfect diagonal, withouta suspicion of stiffness or formalism in the fluent arrangement ofinnumerable details of pattern! This strong sense of appropriate andaustere design, supported by such an easy grace of handling, is unusualin any age, and especially in our own, when grace and austerity find italmost impossible to live together in one mans work.Turning away from these subjects, in which nature presents a wide rangeto the artist and inspires him to breadth and dignity of treatment, tothe quaint and touching subjects drawn from peasant life in the Vendeanhomes, we find beneath the admirable form of Lepres expressionthoughts tender and merry and filled with sympathy for commonexperience. His work becomes picturesque and living, the mood of theobserver changes in response, and the pleasure given is that inspiredby simple things, although the treatment of the given scene is oftenfar from simple.While all these plates are admirably expressive, one in particular,_Le Nid_, seems to me filled with melody, color and charm as well aswith the efficient intelligence always to be found in Lepres work.A little solid house with thick walls stands in greenery. Children,natural, happy, unconcerned, are playing in the foreground. Beyond isa curve of low hill and a glimpse of flat plain; and still beyond,a little town with its spire. It is all very nave and fresh; theoutdoor setting has much beauty; the types of the children areunhackneyed; the gestures and positions unconventional and spontaneous.A mere glance reveals the felicity of the subject-matter, but longeracquaintance is necessary before all the resources of the design areappreciated. Even in this playful note of pleasant summer pastime weget something of the gravity and serious purpose indispensable to greatetchers as to great painters. It was this characteristic that ledLepre to pull down all the detail of the middle distance below thenoble swinging line of the hillock, in order to keep the severity ofthat magnificent curve. It was this which led him to follow a repeatingcurve in the arrangement and environment of the children, apparentlyso carelessly disposed among their shrubs and flowers. Let all thingsplay and bloom and make holiday, he seems to exclaim in this rareplate, so long as the power of my design is not weakened by them. Theartist whose work says that to us is sure of long life in our memories.There are several of these subjects in which children at play neartheir homes are the principal feature, and it would be easy to find ineach some special note of gaiety and charm and quick Gallic wit. In_Les deux Bourrines_, for example, the groups of little ugly creatures,who form again a curved line of beauty, are characterized with a frankacceptance of their unclassic physiognomies that would have delightedthe heart of Daumier. _Le Nid de Pauvres_ is not less romantic in itsGothic avoidance of the ideal type.[Illustration: LEPRE. PROVINSSize of the original etching, 6  11 inches][Illustration: LEPRE. LEGLISE DE JOUY LE MOUTIERSize of the original etching, 6  6 inches][Illustration: LEPRE. LENFANT PRODIGUESize of the original etching, 9  12 inches]Classic Lepre can be, however, with a curiously vital appreciationof what the living classic must have been. He has an etching of aswineherd entering the yard in which the beasts are penned. They move,grunting, toward him. Outside is a cluster of great trees with bushyfoliage. The light is clear and warm. The folds of the swineherdsmantle and his gesture are Greek. His figure might have passed acrossthe Athenian stage, one fancies, at the time of Sophoclean drama. Andthe landscape has the deep repose immortalized in classic verse--suchsongs as in his extreme old age Sophocles made to do honor to hisnative village:  Our home, Colonus, gleaming fair and white:  The nightingale still haunteth all our woods,      Green with the flush of spring;      And sweet, melodious floods  Of softest song through grove and thicket ring.Lepre is not often found in this mood, however, and the swineherdplate cannot be considered wholly characteristic of his temper ofmind. It seems to have been one of those rare happenings when the mindis lifted above its habitual plane, occasion serves, and the trainedhand obediently records a moment of peculiar exaltation. He is perhapsmost of all his daily self in the little plate called _Le Moulin desChapelles_. Here he shows us the machinery of the mill and the roundwhite column of the structure as others have done, but he also shows uswhat others seldom do--the use of the mill. A patient horse is standingnear, a man is shifting the bags of flour to his back. It is not a mereaccident of landscape; it has a social and utilitarian function; it isconnected with human life.This is the most characteristic attitude of mind for an artist soalert to the significance of visible things; and it is immensely tohis credit as an artist that he almost never permits this keen andthrobbing interest in the world about him to trespass upon his logicaluse of his great instrument.If organization of line and space, ability to establish in each of hiscompositions a decorative scheme adequate to support easily all thedelightful episodes and figures which he chooses to introduce, is themost important element in Lepres artistic equipment, the next insignificance is the clarity and precision of his utterance. There isno vapor in his imagination; he is a poet as well as an artist, with apoets sensitiveness to definition of form. All that he lacks is theintensity of emotion that sweeps away interest in everything but thepersonal feeling. We suspect that the world for him will always befull of a number of things, and that he will not be able to forgetany of them in the exaltation of profound self-absorption. But he hasa genius for infusing a rich suggestiveness into all that he observes,and for giving his narrative an epic character.HERMAN A. WEBSTERBY MARTIN HARDIEDid you ever see a barber sharpen his razor? Thats what itwants--the decision and the smacks. That is one of the many quaintremarks that old John Varley used to hurl at the pupils who came to himfor lessons in the complete art of painting in water-color. It is aremark very appropriate to the vast quantity of etchings, mechanicallycorrect, but unimpassioned and uninteresting, which are producedto-day. There are wonderfully few etchers whose work strikes a note ofimagination and individuality, and appeals by its force and directness,its decisions and its smacks. One of that small company is Mr. HermanA. Webster.An artists life is written in his work, and the cold facts of hisbiography are of little real importance. To some extent, however, theyact as a commentary upon his productions, and at the worst they serveto satisfy the not unpardonable curiosity which impels all of us toinquire into the age and life-history of any man whose pictures orprints awaken our instant sympathy. So I put here a few outlines ofMr. Websters career, merely the mile-stones that mark the route alongwhich he has proceeded. It has been a career of strenuous activity,for the artist who now prints his finely-wrought plates in his studioin the Rue de Furstenberg at Paris (the street of which Whistler madea lithograph in 1894) has graduated at a famous university, traveledround the world, spent two years in commercial life, toiled as generalreporter to a big daily paper, worked in a coal-mine, and acted asassistant cashier in a bank. And the tale of his years is only justover thirty, for he was born in 1878. Need I add--for an English readerit would be quite superfluous--that Mr. Webster is an American, withNew York as his native city?Mr. Webster came into the world with an innate love of art. In hisschool-days, before he had received any instruction in drawing, hemade posters, that were perhaps crude but not ineffective, for theschool games; and at Yale he was one of the editors and a valuedillustrator of the _Yale Record_. This love of art was fostered by avisit to the 1900 Exposition at Paris, where the _genius loci_ has astronger spell for the young artist than anywhere else upon earth.Studios and restaurants of the Quartier Latin are fragrant with greatmemories, still haunted by the mighty spirits of the past: Louvre andLuxembourg are filled with the living realities that abide. Amid theenchantment of this artistic atmosphere, with all its traditions andassociations, Mr. Webster lingered for some months, and then set outon a trans-Siberian tour to the Orient, staying long enough in Japanand China for his natural instinct to be quickened by the marvelousart which has exerted so strong an influence on the Western world.On returning home his desire to adopt art as his life-calling waschecked by family opposition. Here in England--for I write as one ofMr. Websters English admirers--many a boy artist has been thwartedby a foolish antipathy in the home circle to art in the abstract, butfor a parent in the New World the conviction must be even more sincerethat business is the only lucrative profession, while art is at leastsomething precarious, if not a downward road to poverty and starvation.And so, at his fathers wish, Mr. Webster, in the office of the_Chicago Record-Herald_ and elsewhere, served two years of bondage tocommerce. Determination, however, won its way at last, and in February,1904, he set out to Paris with the family consent to try it for ayear. That year is still continuing.[Illustration: WEBSTER. ST. OUEN, ROUENHis chief delight is in the nooks and corners of old-worldthoroughfares and culs-de-sac, where deep shadows lurk in the angles oftime-worn buildings, and sunlight ripples over crumbling walls, seamygables, and irregular tiled roofs.

LA RUE GRENIER SUR LEAU, PARISA fourth plate, perhaps even finer than any of these in its force,directness, and concentrated simplicity, is the _Rue Grenier surlEau_. There is much of Meryon in its clear, crisp line-work. MartinHardie.Size of the original etching, 8  4 inches]Seven months during 1904 were spent at the Acadmie Julien under JeanPaul Laurens, in study from the nude; and that is the only academicinstruction which Mr. Webster has received. A few months after hisarrival in Paris, chance led him to the Bibliothque Nationale, wherehe saw some of Meryons etchings, and fell instantly under the spell ofthe great artist whose sinister needle first revealed the mysteriousand somber poetry of Paris and the Seine. From Meryon and from bookshe forthwith taught himself to etch, receiving no outside instruction,but evolving his own methods till he attained mastery of the teasing,temper-trying, yet fascinating art--a mastery the more valuable andcomplete in that it was based on his own experience. A first attemptwas made from his studio window in the Rue de Furstenberg, and somecopperplates went with him on his autumn holiday at Grez, that prettyand very melancholy village in the Forest of Fontainebleau, whereRobert Louis Stevenson met the romance of his life. As the first-fruitsof this holiday three little etchings won their way into the nextsummers Salon--the _Rue de lAbbaye_, _The Loing at Grez_, and _TheCourt, Bourron_, the last being the forerunner of several subjects ofsimilar type. At the Salon also was hung a large oil-painting of stilllife, a study of fabrics and porcelain; but though color will no doubtclaim allegiance again, Mr. Webster has been too closely held in thrallby etching to essay further experiments in the painters craft.A pilgrimage to Spain in the spring of 1905 was the source of severalspontaneous and effective plates, among them _St. Martins Bridge,Toledo_, and _Mirada de las Reinas, Alhambra_. Up to this point Mr.Websters work may be considered, in a large measure, tentative andexperimental, but from 1906 onward he has found in Normandy--at Pont delArche and Rouen--at Bruges, and above all in Paris, the inspirationfor a series of plates noteworthy for their fine craftsmanship andtheir expression of individuality. They have won him the recognitionof connoisseurs and public without his passing through any periodof undeserved obscurity. At the Paris Salon, at the Royal Academy,and in his native land, his etchings have constantly been exhibitedand admired. Nor must I forget to add that in 1908 he was elected anAssociate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, which, under thepresidency of its veteran founder, Sir Francis Seymour Haden, has doneso much to foster the revived art of etching.[Illustration: WEBSTER. QUAI MONTEBELLOFew etchers have ever preached the gospel of light with more truthand earnestness than Webster himself in the _Quai Montebello_ and manyother plates. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 7  5 inches][Illustration: WEBSTER. LE PONT NEUF, PARISA fitting companion to this vision of Notre Dame is _Le Pont Neuf_,another of the etchers largest and most distinguished plates. Thestern solidity of the bridge, with its massive masonry, its corbeledturrets, and its deeply shadowed arches, makes pleasing contrast withthe irregular sky-line of the sunlit houses that rise beyond. MartinHardie.Size of the original etching, 8  11 inches]It is of some of the chief works produced and exhibited during thelast three years that I have now to speak, and in doing so may perhapsindicate a few leading characteristics of the etchers work. His chiefdelight is in the nooks and corners of old-world thoroughfaresand culs-de-sac, where deep shadows lurk in the angles of time-wornbuildings, and sunlight ripples over crumbling walls, seamy gables,and irregular tiled roofs. Of such is a series of subjects found inold Rouen--the _St. Ouen_; the _Rue du Hallage_, where the cathedralspire towers high above old timbered houses; and that charming platewith the title _Old Houses, Rouen_, a quaint corner of tenementswhose high-pitched roofs stand propped against one another for allthe world like a castle of cards. The etcher of this and of the _St.Ouen_ was welcomed with warm sympathy by the _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_,which said that never before has there been so fervent and skilledan interpreter of the bowed timber and crumbling plaster of the oldhouses of Rouen, which line the street ending in the cathedral with itspointed spire against the open sky. And so we pass to two courtyardscenes--belonging, like the Rouen subjects, to the year 1906--the_Cour, Normandie_, and _Les Blanchisseuses_. In both we find the artistbecoming more adept in using broad and balanced disposition of lightand shade to give not merely chiaroscuro but the suggestion of actualcolor, and more skilled in adding exquisiteness of detail to refinedtruth of visual impression. _Les Blanchisseuses_, in particular, withits rich mystery of shadow, with its sunshine falling on white wallsand lighting the seamed interstices of plaster and timber, has anindefinable charm that, for myself at any rate, makes it a high-watermark in Mr. Websters art. Of similar type is the _Old Butter Market,Bruges_, where a cobbled street curves beneath a shadowed archway; andthen for variety you step from _Bruges la Morte_, from the silentcobbles that centuries ago were a busy thoroughfare for ringing feet,to the Bruges of to-day. It is Bruges in a very different aspect, thisfree and spirited study made on July 27, 1907, on the day of the Ftede lArbre dOr, giving a quick impression of gay holiday crowds, ofbanners fluttering against the open sky, and of the belfry old andbrown whose carillon inspired Americas poet, as its tall form andfretted outline have inspired the American etcher of whom I write. This_Bruges en Fte_, and _Paysanne_, a clever and direct figure-study ofan old peasant at Marlotte, come as an episode of pleasing varietyin Mr. Websters work, and tend to show that, though he has hispreferences, he is not really fettered by any limitation of subject ortreatment.[Illustration: WEBSTER. LA RUE CARDINALE_La Rue Cardinale_ has affinity of general treatment with _Rue de laParcheminerie_, and is not the less interesting for an amazing _tour deforce_ in the rendering of color and texture in the striped blind overa shop-front. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 10  7 inches][Illustration: WEBSTER. LA RUE DE LA PARCHEMINERIE, PARISClosely akin to _Rue Brise Miche_ in restful balance of compositionand in fine shadow effect is the _Rue de la Parcheminerie_--of specialvalue now, for the old street has disappeared largely since the makingof the plate. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 11  7 inches]It is but natural that an artist of Mr. Websters temperament, adevoted admirer of Meryon, should become absorbed in Paris herself andendeavor to put upon copperplate the posie profonde et compliqudune vaste capitale. The Bruges and Rouen plates showed Mr. Websterto be keenly susceptible to the magnetism and charm of medievaltradition, but Paris, steeped in sentiment even more than Rouen orBruges, was to rouse a still greater warmth and feeling. He began bysearching out those picturesque streets in the old quarters that havesurvived the wholesale demolishment of Baron Haussmann, a name hated byartists as that of Granger by lovers of books. The _Rue Brise Miche_found its way to the Royal Academy, and was also honored by publicationin the _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ (July, 1907). Closely akin to it inrestful balance of composition and in fine shadow effect is the _Ruede la Parcheminerie_--of special value now, for the old street hasdisappeared largely since the making of the plate. _La Rue Cardinale_has affinity of general treatment, and is not the less interestingfor an amazing _tour de force_ in the rendering of color and texturein the striped blind over a shop-front. A fourth plate, perhaps evenfiner than any of these in its force, directness, and concentratedsimplicity, is the _Rue Grenier sur lEau_. There is much of Meryonin its clear, crisp line-work. Some day perhaps these loving studiesof the old Paris of Balzac may be gathered in a series illustratingthe Quartier Marais, and published in an _dition de luxe_ withdescriptive text by the etcher. Let us hope that this may come to pass,for the buildings that Mr. Webster depicts are far more than a prosaicrecord of architectural features. There is a spiritual and humansuggestiveness behind the mortar and bricks of his pictures: as a poetof his own nation has it, they are latent with unseen existences. Hehas appreciated the fact that etching--an art hedged in by limitationsand depending upon power of suggestion--is the one art that can give atonce those delicate lines, those broad shadows, those crumbling bits oftexture. The lover of etching can regard his subject with indifference,and take full joy in the soft play of sunlight, the fine choice ofline, the effective massing of light and shade.Another plate of this Quartier Marais series is a noblerepresentation of Notre Dame seen from an unusual aspect. It is adrawing from near the Htel de Ville and shows the splendid mass ofthe cathedral rising above the irregular houses that face the QuartierMarais and the Quai aux Fleurs. There is freedom and charm in thetreatment of the foreground, where a little tug puffs along the riverand the big barges move cumbrously under the lee of the near bank, andin the middle distance where the light plays pleasantly over the oldhouses; but the roof of the cathedral itself, put in with unpleasingrigidity of line, comes like cold fact in the middle of romance. It isas though Meryon here had imposed his weakness as well as his strengthupon Mr. Webster, for in the _Morgue_, for instance, the one smallblemish is the ruled precision of the lines upon a roof. A fittingcompanion to this vision of Notre Dame is _Le Pont Neuf_, another ofthe etchers largest and most distinguished plates. The stern solidityof the bridge, with its massive masonry, its corbeled turrets, and itsdeeply shadowed arches, makes pleasing contrast with the irregularsky-line of the sunlit houses that rise beyond.It may be said of all Mr. Websters etchings--and perhaps there couldbe no higher praise--that each possesses the faculty of provoking freshinterest. That is certainly the case with four of his most recentplates. One is an interior of _St. Saturnin, Toulouse_, majestic andstately, full of suggestive mystery in the religious light that fallswith soft touch upon the pillars, throws into relief the dark massesof the choir-stalls, and strives to penetrate the dim recesses ofthe vaulted roof. _St. Saturnin_ will be among the rariora of thecollector, for the plate unfortunately broke when twelve proofs onlyhad been printed.The artists subtle perception of light and his refined draughtsmanshiphave been used to singular advantage in the _Ancienne Facult deMdecine, 1608_. One is grateful to him for his fine record of thisdomed building that was a little gem of Renaissance art, thoughthere is a note of sadness in the substructure of balks and struts setat its base by the ruthless hand of the destroyer.[Illustration: WEBSTER.

A church porchhas also supplied the subject of one of Mr. Websters latest works,_Notre Dame des Andelys_. The ordinary observer will delight in theprint for its beautiful rendering of a noble fragment of architecture.Those who have real knowledge of etching will appreciate it still morefor its clever biting and for its subtle delicacy of line so cunninglyused for the indication of stone, glass, and woodwork with theirdifferent surfaces and textures.That plate of _Notre Dame des Andelys_, though not the most instantlyengaging, is perhaps the most accomplished which the artist hasproduced. It is in this accomplishment that from the coldly criticalpoint of view I see an indication--a hint only--of possible danger.Here, and to some extent in the _Pont Neuf_ and the _Rue Grenier_,the careful, tense, concentrated work shows almost too disciplined aself-control. Close study of these prints gives just a touch of theirritation that comes from watching the monotonous perfection of afirst-class game-shot or golfer, bringing a malicious desire for somemistake or piece of recklessness. The true etching always appeals insome degree by its spice of adventure, by some happiness of accident,and so while the _Pont Neuf_ and the _Notre Dame des Andelys_ rousefull admiration and respect for their splendid artistry, the morehaphazard methods of the _Rue Brise Miche_ and _Les Blanchisseuses_touch a far deeper note of sympathy. They have in them the breezy,natural oratory that is often so much more stirring than the fluent,polished periods of the accomplished speaker. But even where Mr.Webster is most precise in his articulation, most resolute in hisadherence to familiar truths, he always combines with this a personalaspect and a power of selection that, disregarding the commonplace andpetty, lends poetry to the interpretation. His careful work is veryfar removed from the cold and careful work of the ordinary uninspiredcraftsman.In studying the work of a young etcher--and Mr. Webster is still youngas an etcher--it is almost always possible to trace certain influenceswhich, quite legitimately, have acted upon his choice of subject andhis technique. In one of his first etchings, _The Court, Bourron_, theWhistler influence is frankly apparent. _Les Blanchisseuses_ is in nosense an imitative plate, but I should have said it was the work of aman who knew Whistlers _Unsafe Tenement_ by heart. And there comes inthe critics danger of leaping to rash conclusions, for Mr. Webstertells me he never saw that print by Whistler till long after hisetching was made. For the Meryon influence, which is clearly apparentin much of his work, Mr. Webster makes no apology. Nor need he doso; for if he reminds us, here a little of Whistler, there a littleof Meryon, there is always a large measure of himself besides. Thetrue artist lights his torch from that of his predecessors: it is hisbusiness to carry on great traditions. I have done my best simply tolearn from him, not to steal--that is Mr. Websters own expressiveway of putting it.[Illustration: WEBSTER. NOTRE DAME DES ANDELYSThe ordinary observer will delight in _Notre Dame des Andelys_ for itsbeautiful rendering of a noble fragment of architecture. Those who havereal knowledge of etching will appreciate it still more for its cleverbiting and for its subtle delicacy of line so cunningly used for theindication of stone, glass, and woodwork with their different surfacesand textures.

OUEN, ROUENGothic canopies and tracery are drawn with loving care in the _Portedes Marmousets, St. Ouen, Rouen_, but here again it is the mystery ofshadow in the deep porch that supplies the true theme.Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 10  7 inches]Mr. Webster has not learned from Meryon at the cost of his ownindividuality, and one reason for the freshness that characterizeshis work is that he is one of those who like to transfer their firstimpressions of nature direct to the plate in the open air. With veryfew exceptions, that is how his etchings have been made. A certainamount of work is necessarily done afterward in the retirement of thestudio, but the straightforward method of rendering nature gives avividness and spontaneity that careful work from intermediate studiesin pencil or color can rarely produce. This spontaneity is the veryessence of good etching, for with etching, as with water-color, itshighest charm is inevitably troubled by mechanical labor; it isessentially a method of which one feels that if twere done, twerewell done quickly. The etcher should no more be able to stay the quickgliding of his needle in the middle of a line than the skater to standstill upon the outside edge. And I think that the etcher who worksstraight from nature is more apt to search out the notes and accentsof character and to seize upon those structural lines which are afundamental necessity to his work.Another chief excellence in Mr. Websters work lies in the fact thatfrom the first he has been his own printer. He is no believer in theprinciple followed by many other etchers of biting their plate andleaving it to some one with the palm of a duchess to do the rest.Patient acquisition of craftsmanship is bound to tell, for the paidprinter, be he never so skilled, cannot hope to understand an artistsintentions quite so well as the artist himself. Mr. Webster, however,has no need of any artifice; there is no trace in his etchings of themeretricious printing which Whistler condemned as treacly. Light andshade enter into charming alliance in his prints, but line is alwaysof the confederacy, and it is to purity of line that the shadows whichtell so strongly owe their strength. In the very depths of them thereis always a luminous gloom, never a trace of the harshness and opacitythat come from slurred workmanship and reliance upon printers ink.Perhaps I have said too much already, for Mr. Websters work is wellable to speak for itself. But there is one noteworthy feature, commonto all his plates, that claims attention, and that is his power ofrendering sunlight. If he loves dark and dingy thoroughfares withdilapidated roofs and moldering plaster, it is for the sake of thosequaint shadows that peep from their recesses and climb the high walls,and still more for the patches of brilliant, quivering sunlight towhich the shadows give so full a value. He seems to hear, like Corot,the actual crash of the sun upon the wall--lclat du soleil quifrappe.PART IIIt is difficult to clothe ones speech in the detached terms of acatalogue when writing of an artist whose work always kindles freshenthusiasm. And so I may perhaps be pardoned if, in adding something toa previous essay upon the etchings of Herman A. Webster, I venture tostrike a more personal note.[Illustration: WEBSTER. VIEILLES MAISONS, RUE HAUTEFEUILLE, PARISHe loves dark and dingy thoroughfares with dilapidated roofs andmoldering plaster, ... for the patches of brilliant, quivering sunlightto which the shadows give so full a value. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 11  5 inches][Illustration: WEBSTER. LA ROUTE DE LOUVIERSIn landscape, as in his architectural work, Webster sets his themeupon the plate with fine skill of arrangement and with exquisitedraughtsmanship. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 6  8 inches]There can be few men to whom art is more of a religion than to Webster.On two occasions when I saw him during his hurried visits to Londonin the spring of 1910, he spoke of his art with all the zeal of amissionary and the fervor of a convert. He seemed to be laboring ina slough of despond, beset with a feeling that his past work wassomething worthless, to be thrown aside like Christians bundle. Heappeared to be torn in sunder by divers doctrines, telling me of theconstant ebb and flow of argument in the Paris cafs and studiosbetween the _parti mtier_ and the _parti me_--those who maintainedthat finished technique, the _cuisine_ of the French student, wasthe final aim, and those who held that the artists own emotion,howsoever it might find expression, was the greatest thing of all.Webster felt--and it was a fact, indeed, at which I hinted in writingof his work before--that he was sacrificing something of the _me_to the _mtier_; and his own realization of that is already becomingapparent in his outlook and his style. Then, too, his talk was all ofthe attainment and suggestion of light as the supreme quality in anetching; and here I could reassure him, for few have ever preached thegospel of light with more truth and earnestness than Webster himself inthe _Quai Montebello_ and many other plates.Still, there matters stood more than a year ago, and the plates thatWebster had etched at Marseilles and elsewhere lay rejected andunbitten in his studio. Then he set out to America, where he spentthe summer of 1910, and, like Mr. Pennell, fell a victim to thesky-scrapers of New York. They are the most marvelous things, hewrote, on the face of Mother Earth to-day. It took me two months tobegin to see them, but then they began to glow, to take shape, and togrow. Perhaps no work of human hands in all the world offers such astupendous picture as New York seen from almost anywhere within thedown-town district, or from the river or the bay. There are cliffs andcaons where sun and shadow work the weirdest miracles, and soaringabove them, between forty and fifty stories from the ground, risearched roofs and pointed ones, gray and gold and brown, that one mustsee with ones own eyes to have the faintest conception of. From acrossthe Hudson in the afternoon when the sun goes down you can watch theshadows creep up the sides of these mountains of brick and stone untilyoud swear you were looking out on some gigantic fairyland.His admiration of those sky-scrapers found expression in a series ofdrawings made on behalf of _The Century Magazine_, and in, at anyrate, one etching--the _Cortlandt Street, New York_. The subject willappeal most, perhaps, to those who live beneath the familiar shadeof these monstrous habitations, with their hundreds of staring eyes;but the ordinary man, though he may find it strangely uninspiringand unromantic, will at any rate admire the firm decision of thedrawing and welcome the slender filaments and trembling gray spiralsof smoke--so difficult to express in line with a point of steel--thatcast a veil over the sordid reality of the scene. Though Webstercarried that one plate to a finish, he was still obsessed by all sortsof doubts. Many drawings were torn up, and many plates that he etchedwere wilfully destroyed. Just as the golfer falls victim to too muchreading of theoretical works, so for Webster his eager indulgence intheory and science put him off his game. I say all this to accountfor what must seem a small output during two years for a man whosesole work is etching. It is all to the artists credit; but, nonethe less, we have suffered, _nous autres_, for his convictions. Now,however, Richard is himself again. A month or more spent in Frankfortthis summer has produced a series of pencil-drawings and etchings whichshould bring satisfaction and content both to the artist and to all whoadmire his work.[Illustration: WEBSTER. BENDERGASSE, FRANKFORTThen there are the _Street of the Three Kings_, the _Bendergasse_, and_Sixteenth Century Houses_, all of them felicitous in charm of theme,in play of light and shade, and in the suggestion of life given by theanimated figures. Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 8  5 inches][Illustration: WEBSTER. CORTLANDT STREETSize of the original etching, 12  7 inches]Before speaking of the Frankfort series of etchings, a word may besaid about Websters pencil-drawings. I know of no other artist, saveperhaps Mr. Muirhead Bone, who can use the pencil-point with suchexquisite fineness and precision in the production of an architecturaldrawing that, with all its accuracy, still retains the freshness ofa sketch. Finding in a portfolio a drawing of _Cortlandt Street_ andseveral others that repeated the subjects of the Frankfort etchings,I felt curious as to the exact relationship between these drawingsand the work on the copperplate. This interest was largely, perhaps,that of a fellow-etcher, keen to see how the wheels go round, butWebsters reply to a question on this subject may interest others aswell. I determine my composition, he wrote, in outline first. Thisoutline I transfer to the plate. Then I go out and carefully studyin pencil, on the original outline sketch, the subject I want to do,so as to get acquainted with it before beginning the more exactingwork upon the copperplate. I never use a drawing to work from exceptsometimes as an extra guide in the biting, where a careful study canbe very useful. They are beautiful things, these pencil-drawingsof New York and Frankfort, but there can be only one of each. Theetchings, fortunately, can be shared and enjoyed by many possessors.Frankfort has grown to be a large and very modern town with broadthoroughfares and palatial buildings; but it has its old quarteras well, and among the houses that nestle in narrow streets roundthe cathedral, Webster has found the same kind of subject thatfascinated him before in Bruges and Marseilles and Paris. A brilliantdraughtsman, he never seems to hesitate or lose his way among themanifold intricacies of the old-world buildings that he depicts. Heaims always at knitting his subjects into fine unity of compositionby broad massing of light and shade. In the last few months, hewrites, I have grown never to make an etching for etchings sake, butfor the means it gives of studying closely the play of light acrossmy subject. That is his main theme: the light that travels now withcold curiosity as it did centuries ago, glancing into open windows,throwing into relief a corbel or a crocket, casting a shadow under eaveor window ledge, revealing, like a patch in some tattered garment, thecracks and seams in moldering plaster or time-worn timber. In depictingthese storehouses of human joys and aspirations, hopes and despairs,he has none of Meryons gloom and morbidness. It is true that behindmany of the windows in these poor homes of his pictures some MarieClaire may be toiling in sad-eyed poverty; yet for Webster the outsideshall be sunny, little white curtains shall veil the gloom, and flowersshall blossom on the window ledge, though the sad worker may havewatered them with her tears. And if sunshine is still potent in thesenew plates, there is also a fresh and joyous note of life and movementin the streets. The introduction of figures, well placed and full ofcharacter, is a new development in Websters art. Bustling workers, orhappy groups of gossiping women, or the dark mass of a distant crowd,are introduced with consummate skill, and the picturesqueness of theold streets gains new value from the suggestion of this living streamof human traffic. The presence of modern life enhances the gray andwrinkled age of the buildings which have watched so many generationscome and go.[Illustration: WEBSTER. LOWENPLTZCHEN, FRANKFORTSize of the original etching, 8  6 inches][Illustration: WEBSTER. DER LANGER FRANZ, FRANKFORT_Der Langer Franz_, a view of the Rathaus tower that took its nicknamefrom a tall burgomaster of the town, is a little gem, brilliant withlight and rich in the mystery of shadow.Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching. 4  3 inches]Among the new plates are four that deal with street scenes in the AltStadt of Frankfort. _Der Langer Franz_, a view of the Rathaus towerthat took its nickname from a tall burgomaster of the town, is thesmallest of all, but a little gem, brilliant with light and rich in themystery of shadow. Then there are the _Street of the Three Kings_, the_Bendergasse_, and _Sixteenth-century Houses_, all of them felicitousin charm of theme, in play of light and shade, and in the suggestion oflife given by the animated figures. There are admirable figures againin _An Old Court_, one of the plates that the collector of future dayswill most desire to possess. There is less in it of obvious labor thanin the street scenes; the etcher has overcome a natural fear of blankspaces; and his reticence and more summary execution have lent to thisplate much of the unconscious and unpremeditated charm that is one ofthe finest qualities which an etching can possess.Two etchings of old bridges over the Main at Frankfort must rankamong the best work that Webster has yet produced. One is a small andspirited plate showing the tower of the cathedral and a row of houses,most delicately drawn, rising with a beautiful sky-line above the solidmass of the shadowed bridge with its heavy buttresses. The other showsthe old bridge that spans the Main between Frankfort and Sachsenhausen.Legend tells that in compensation for finishing the building withina certain time the architect made a vow to sacrifice to the devilthe first living being that crossed the bridge. Then, when the fatalday arrived, he drove a cock across, and so cheated the devil of hisdue. Much the same story of outwitting the devil is told about thebuilding of the cathedral at Aix-la-Chapelle. Whether Webster venturedupon any compact I do not know; but this plate, in its building, inits well-constructed composition, in its splendid effect of brilliantsunshine, is one of the most successful tasks he has ever accomplished.The group of figures on the near bank, happily placed like those inVermeers famous _View of Delft_, adds no little to the charm of thescene. I would set this plate beside _Les Blanchisseuses_ and the_Quai Montebello_, which Mr. Wedmore has found modestly perfect, asrepresenting the very summit of Websters art.[Illustration: WEBSTER.

It is not merelyfine in its pattern of light and shade, but it has a direct force andsimplification that are rich with promise for the future.Martin Hardie.Size of the original etching, 8  5 inches]While he has surrendered for the time being to the charm of Frankfort,Webster has not been unfaithful to the Paris of his early love. OfParis he might say, like Montaigne, That city has ever had my heart;and it has fallen out to me, as of excellent things, that the moreof other fine cities I have seen since, the more the beauty of thisgains on my affections. I love it tenderly, even with all itswarts and blemishes. All the more for the warts and blemishes ofits old buildings Webster loves it, too; and while working on hisFrankfort plates he has completed another of _La Rue St. Jacques,Paris_, which, I think, is one of the best etchings he has evermade. At times, even in his Frankfort plates, one still feels thathis superb draughtsmanship and his love of detail--_ce superflu, sincessaire_--have led him to a uniformity of finish that is almosttoo icily regular. I do not mean that Websters elaboration is thecold, almost meaningless, elaboration of the line-engraver; nor do Iforget that the technique of Meryon, one of the greatest masters ofetchings, was, in Mr. Wedmores happy phrasing, one of unfalteringfirmness and regularity, one of undeterred deliberation. All the same,one wishes that Meryon had done a few more things like the _Rue desMauvais Garons_, and wishes that Webster also, in a similar way, werenow and then less sure of himself, were held sometimes by a tremblinghesitancy, or driven sometimes by the passion of the moment to allowroom for fortunate accident and rapid suggestion. For that reason Iwelcome his _Rue St. Jacques_. It is not merely fine in its pattern oflight and shade, but it has a direct force and simplification that arerich with promise for the future.Since writing the above, I have seen working-proofs of two new etchingsof landscape. And here, too, there is high promise. They show, atleast, that Webster is not going to remain a man of one subject; thathe is opening his heart to the beauty and romance of simple nature. Hehas sought his first themes in that pleasant countryside where, betweentall poplars, you get peeps of Chteau Gaillard, nobly set upon itshill. In landscape, as in his architectural work, Webster sets histheme upon the plate with fine skill of arrangement and with exquisitedraughtsmanship. These two plates, _Chteau Gaillard_ and _La Routede Louviers_, are exhilarating in their feeling of sunshine, and theyplease by their absolute simplicity of statement. They are honest, andwithout artifice. Printed as clean as a whistle, without any of thedoubtful expedients that give a meretricious attractiveness to so muchmodern etching, they appeal by their rightness of pattern and precisionof line. Those who see high promise as well as present fulfilment inWebsters art, will not regret that he has left the town and set outwhere                  thro the green land,  Vistas of change and adventure,  The gray roads go beckoning and winding.ANDERS ZORN--PAINTER-ETCHERBY J. NILSEN LAURVIKBroadly speaking there are but two kinds of artists--innovators andimitators. The first may be known by the opposition they arouse inthe sacred sanctums of mediocrity and by their final but reluctantacceptance by the self-appointed custodians of the Hall of Fame whosebusiness it is to exclude genius until Time shall have tempered all itsbuoyant, youthful enthusiasms, which are the very signs and tokens ofthose starry creatures whom the gods have blessed. Youth and all itsamazing prodigality are of the very essence of genius, and it is byvirtue of this exuberant overflowing of the spirit that the works ofAnders Zorn make their vital appeal.He celebrates with fervent, dramatic strokes the pageant of the visibleworld, and all that his alert eyes can see his nimble fingers depictwith an unfailing sense of the pictorial possibilities inherent in thepassing procession of contemporary life. There is in his work somethingof childlike spontaneity,--a healthy, natural enjoyment in the merepractice of his art that is infectious. He has the same impartiallove for nature as it is as had Velasquez and Frans Hals, and thesame incomparable interdependence of head and hand. His art is, inthe best sense of the word, purely objective, dedicated to a specifictranscription of the outward semblance of things. These bright,vivacious plates are not evolved by any painful process of mentalcogitation, nor are they the result of imaginative vagaries.Zorn is concerned but little with abstract form or involvedcompositions. But he cannot be accused of evading difficulties throughany fear of failure, as he has so convincingly demonstrated in hisvivid, sun-flecked _Interior of a Parisian Omnibus_ with its sharplycharacterized passengers, and in his dramatically effective _Waltz_with its assemblage of swaying figures moving rhythmically through thespacious ball-room, both marvels of discerning observation recordedwith an almost clairvoyant magic of line that evoke the kaleidoscopicshimmer and brilliancy of the scenes depicted. The difficultiespresented by these complex subjects are surmounted with the samenonchalant ease and certainty that distinguish his long series ofindividual portraits and figure pieces. That the latter predominatein the hierarchy of his etched work is a matter of choice rather thanof chance and may, I think, be taken as an indication of his keenappreciation of the limitations as well as the possibilities of thismedium. No one, not even Whistler, has realized more clearly than hethat etching at its best is essentially an impressionistic art, to bepractised only in the happiest moods, and his finest plates are marvelsof swift, stenographic notations that have been scratched upon thecopper direct from nature in a white heat of enthusiasm.[Illustration: ZORN. PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AND HIS WIFESize of the original etching, 12  8 inches][Illustration: ZORN. THE WALTZSize of the original etching, 13  9 inches]He calls etching his diversion, which accounts for the uniformlyhigh quality of this side of his art. Done for the sheer love ofit, as other men would ride horseback or play golf, these plates arethe product of a joyousness that is the mother of all great art. Itis typical of him that he should have taken up the practice of thisexacting though elusive art merely as an amusement, as he himselfsays, with which to while away odd hours, instead of sitting athome or going about for entertainment. This is characteristic ofhis whole life and harks back to the genesis of his artistic careerwhen, as a mere lad, he carved in birch-wood with his clasp-knifeimages of the flocks he tended in the Dalecarlian forests. Even inthose early days this son of humble peasant folk revealed a power oflifelike characterization that did not pass unnoticed by these shrewd,clear-eyed peasantry whose sole criterion in matters of art was whetheror not the counterfeit presentment looked like the original. And inthese small carved images of cows and sheep they found a strikingresemblance to their models that aroused their keenest admiration. Hisfirst patron was one of these peasant folk, a shepherd friend of his,who bought from him a carved statuette of an enraged cow for whichZorn received in payment a sou and a little white loaf. To make hissculpture more lifelike he used to imitate antique statuary by tintinghis work. His palette was the palm of his hand, in which he mixed acomposite of bilberry juice and certain coloring substances obtainedfrom little forest flowers.That was the beginning of a sturdy naturalism that no subsequentacademic training has been able to nullify. Even in these firsttentative attempts at personal expression he revealed the essentialqualities of his genius,--his very powerful color sense and his acuteobservation of natural phenomena. His work betrays an almost savagedelight in the truth of nature, and if to be truthful is to be cruel,then Zorn is often cruel. He employs no gentle gloss, and, whether itbe friend or casual sitter, each is treated with unblushing frankness.A full-blooded art, somewhat primitive and exulting in its crudestrength, it gives one a pulsating sense of reality. His work has thenatural daring of one who is on familiar terms with all the secretsof his art. Conveying an appearance of brilliant, almost recklessimprovisation, it is none the less the result of astute and penetratingobservation that has in each case recorded the face of actuality aswell as its deeper and abiding spirit.Strongly opposed to all the conventionalities of the studio, he abhorsposing as much as he dislikes monogamy, preferring to study hissubjects under natural conditions when they are off their guard andthen to transcribe his impressions very largely from memory, after theessential lines have been noted. Thus have come into being some of hismost memorable plates, such as the _Renan_, and the portrait of himselfand his wife, each executed in a few hours of concentrated effort. Thevery swiftness with which these impressions have been recorded has nodoubt contributed much toward giving them that convincing finalitywhich, paradoxically enough, are theirs in a preminent degree nomatter how casual may appear the means by which this effect has beenachieved. That is the impression left upon one by his illuminatingportrait of the pontifical-looking Renan, for example.[Illustration: ZORN. MADAME SIMONSize of the original etching, 9  6 inches][Illustration: ZORN. ERNEST RENANSize of the original etching, 9  13 inches]Here is set down for all time in a few unerring lines the soul and bodyof the man--the casuist and the voluptuary of thought, the Balzacianbulk of him physically and the bigness of him mentally. The massive andapparently grotesque exterior of this speculative dreamer, immersed inhis own meditations, conveys something of the same sense of aloofnesswith which Rodin has invested his statue of Balzac. They both appearto be dreaming of life and its mysteries until the immense torso seemsbut an Olympian pedestal supporting the domelike head. It is more thana pocket-edition biography, this portrait. Executed in one sitting inRenans study in April of 1892, nine years after his initiation intothe mysteries of etching, this plate may be said to epitomize the wholeart of Zorn,--his vigorous truthfulness, his synthetic treatment ofsalient points of character, and his love of dramatic contrasts ofsharply juxtaposed masses of black and white. Moreover, it furnishes astriking exposition of the purely technical side of his art in whichhe has created for himself a highly original and personal method. Noone has eschewed more rigorously than he the happy accidents employedas a convenient cloak by masquerading incompetents, foisting theirmeaningless scrawls on a bewildered public, to whom etching has becomesynonymous with a pretty dilettantism that is within the easy reach ofevery aspiring fledgling of art. These parallel, slanting strokes thatseem to cut and divide the form into unrelated sections are really theexpression of an accurate and well-defined intention that manifestsitself in the extraordinary verisimilitude of the figure and itsadroitly suggested accessories. It is like a fleeting glimpse in amirror in which the impalpable spirit of reality is reflected, evokingby some mysterious incantation the most fugitive nuances of expressionand gesture with the slightest inflection of his modeling.It is the extreme refinement and subtility in this seeming brutalitythat give to these plates their unique value and interest. Seldomhas a man suggested his predecessors less than does Zorn in theseepigrammatic etchings. They are according to no established formula.If he has looked upon Rembrandt, as what practitioner of aqua fortishas not, there is but slight evidence of it in these straightforwardvibrant plates. To be sure, he has the same love of bold contrasts oflight and shade as had the master of Amsterdam, without the romanticglamour of the dreamy Dutchman. This modern Swede is more direct, moreincisive, his line has something of the penetrating and biting analysisof a page from Strindberg, and not infrequently, as in the case ofhis haunting portrait of the besotted poet Paul Verlaine, there isdiscernible a sort of ironic humor that throws a revealing light uponhis sitter. With what discerning and subtle insight he has portrayedthat gentle flavor of intellectual skepticism which is the chiefcharacteristic of Anatole France; while the head of Rodin, laughing inhis foaming beard, is highly indicative of the immense creative energyof the author of _Le Penseur_. In every instance he has successfullysummarized the essential and abiding characteristics of his sitter,no less effectually accomplished in the twenty-minute impromptu ofMarcelin Berthelot than in the more deliberately studied portraitof Marquand, or the very succinctly realized version of AugustStrindberg, the Swedish author. These portraits of contemporary men andwomen are fascinating records of repeated excursions into the realm of_character_, which holds for Zorn the strongest appeal, as it has everfor all men of the North, whose supreme happiness is the realization ofa clearly defined individualism.[Illustration: ZORN. AUGUST STRINDBERGSize of the original etching, 11  7 inches][Illustration: ZORN. SUNDAY MORNING IN DALECARLIASize of the original etching, 10  7 inches]While Zorn to-day occupies a position of unchallenged supremacy in thedifficult and exacting field of portraiture--his portrait etchingswould alone make a notable Pantheon of contemporary worthies--it is inhis frank, unabashed nudes and in his delineations of Swedish peasanttypes that we find the most personal expression of his peculiar genius.Nowhere has his faculty of instantaneous perception, his ability tograsp at a glance and in its entirety either an isolated individual ora group of figures, been employed to greater advantage than in thesebrilliant, dazzling nudes and in these veracious records of his belovedDalecarlian peasants. With a few swift, sure strokes he gives us thesoft contour, the undulating curves of the fresh, firm flesh, of thesestrong-limbed Junos, as well as the wrinkled, time-worn visages of theaged tillers of the soil.His interest in this type is not episodic, it is persistent. They werehis first subjects as well as his first patrons, and throughout hiscareer it is to them that he has turned for rest and refreshment fromthe social banalities of the mundane life in the great capitals of theworld where he is in constant demand as a painter of exclusive society.At heart he remains a peasant, retaining a strong love for the scenesof his boyhood with all their simple associations. Here he is at home,and here he has given untrammeled expression to that paganism which isthe dominant trait of his character. He delights in portraying thesesturdy, flaxen-haired peasants in all the unconscious abandon of theirnave natures, and the series of plates celebrating the intimate lifeof these people are the most authentic expressions of his art becausethe most closely related to the mainsprings of his personality.His love of the unstudied, unposed naturalness of life has found itsculminating expression in these nudes of women and children as seen inthe open air in the free solitude of the shores of Dalecarlia. Zornregards nature with the eagerness of the primitive, and these ruddywomen are virile protests against the anemic, hypersthetic refinementsof the school-room conventions. Stripped of all regard for the acceptedideals of feminine beauty these women of Zorn repel or appeal by theunfeigned candor of every look and gesture. These big, blonde women,whose naked bodies move with unrestrained freedom through the tonic,balsam air are imbued with a superb, healthy animalism such as hasnever been depicted in the whole history of art. They spring from astrong artistic impulse that has its roots in the subsoil of nature.To see these frankly realistic versions of unsophisticated, throbbingfemininity is to feel that the nude has never before been adequatelyportrayed--all other nudes seem mere means toward some elaboratelypreconceived end while those of Zorn are gloriously self-sufficing, anend in themselves.[Illustration: ZORN. THE BATHER, SEATEDSize of the original etching, 6  4 inches][Illustration: ZORN. EDOEdo is the name of the Swedish island where Zorn etched thisbeautiful plateSize of the original etching, 7  4 inches]An ardent sensuousness marks all these things, but it is sane andwholesome, with no trace of doubtful submeaning. That is strikinglyexemplified in _My Model and my Boat_, in which the exuberant,re-creating force of life is presented in all its tantalizingseductiveness of ample, quivering curves. The beauty of vigoroussymmetry, of inherent strength, overcome the somewhat obviouscoarseness of the type of woman depicted here, and one can have nothingbut admiration for the underlying sincerity as well as the consummatemastery revealed in every stroke of these plates. But the purelyphysical allure of his nudes is by no means always as insistent as inthe foregoing. The elusive and half-reticent feminine charm has notescaped him, and there are some nudes out of doors, in the lambentlight of dawn and twilight, more delicate, more subtly suggestive, thananything hitherto accomplished in etching.The nudes of Rembrandt would look singularly coarse and heavy bycomparison with these silvery, exquisitely modeled Brunhildas ofZorn, who disport themselves on the sunlit beach or emerge fromthe enveloping shadow of some protruding cliff with a childlikeunconsciousness and a pagan navet that disarms prudish prejudices. Inits supple grace and vibrant vitality the delicately modulated back ofthe bending figure of _The Bather--Evening_ is a pantheistic hymn tothe eternal efflorescence of life. She pauses in the silvery twilight,before breaking the surface of the mirror-like lake into a thousandjewels of refracted light, and she is as much a part of the enshroudingstillness as the aged rocks on which she stands. Whistler never didanything more evanescent than the landscape of this plate, which isprinted in a key as light and airy as the magically executed lines,that give the softness of the figures contours as well as the hardnessof the rocks and the veiled serenity of distant lake and woodland.It is a splendid affirmation of the extremely delicate sensibilitiespossessed by this most vigorous and brilliant of contemporary etchers,whose art is one of the most powerful and significant manifestations ofthe re-awakened sthetic impulse of the twentieth century.
