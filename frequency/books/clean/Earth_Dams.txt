The literatureupon this subject is voluminous, but much of it is inaccessible andfar from satisfactory. No attempt will here be made to collate thisliterature or to give a history of the construction of earth dams,however interesting such an account might be. The object will ratherbe to present such a study as will make clear the application of theprinciples underlying the proper design and erection of this classof structures. In no way, therefore, will it assume the character ordignity of a technical treatise.Dams forming storage reservoirs, which are intended to impound largevolumes of water, must necessarily be built of considerable height,except in a very few instances where favorable sites may exist. Recentdiscussions would indicate that a new interest has been awakened inthe construction of high earth dams. As related to the general subjectof storage, it is with the high structure rather than the low thatthis study has to do. To the extent that the greater includes theless, the principles here presented are applicable to works of minorimportance.Many persons who should know better place little importance uponthe skill required for the construction of earthwork embankments,considering the work to involve no scientific problems. It is fartoo common belief that any ordinary laborer, who may be able to useskillfully a scraper on a country road, is fitted to superintendthe construction of an earth dam. It has been said that the art ofconstructing earth dams is purely empirical, that exact sciencefurnishes no approved method of determining their internal stresses,and that in regard to their design experience is much more valuablethan theory. When the question of stability is fully taken intoconsideration, it certainly requires a large amount of skillsuccessfully to carry out works of this character.Extreme care in the selection of the site, sound judgment in thechoice of materials and assiduity in superintending the work while inprogress, are all vitally essential.Classification of Dams.Dams may be classified according to their purpose as diverting dams orweirs and as storage dams. The former may be located upon any portionof a stream where the conditions are favorable, and the water used formanifold purposes, being conveyed by means of canals, flumes, tunnelsand pipe-lines to places of intended use. These dams are generally lowand may be either of a temporary or permanent character, depending uponthe uses to which the water is put. Temporary dams are made of brush,logs, sand bags, gravel and loose rock. The more permanent structuresare built of stone and concrete masonry.Storage dams may be classified according to the kind of materialentering into their structure, as follows: (1) Earth; (2) Earth andTimber; (3) Earth and Rock-fill; (4) Rock-fill; (5) Masonry; (6)Composite Structures.Low dams forming service reservoirs for domestic water supplies andfor irrigation comprise by far the most numerous class. They are notdesigned to impound a large volume of water and therefore may be builtacross a small ravine or depression, or even upon the summit of a hill,by excavating the reservoir basin and using the material excavated toform the embankment. These reservoirs may be used in connection withsurface or gravity systems, artesian wells, or underground suppliesobtained by pumping. The dams forming these reservoirs being ofmoderate size and height may vary greatly in shape and dimensions.The form may be made to suit the configuration of the dam site. Whenthe earthwork requires it, they may be lined with various materialsto secure water-tightness. Often such dams are made composite incharacter, partly of earth and partly of masonry or some othermaterial. They are also frequently accompanied by numerous accessories,such as settling-basins, aerating devices and covers, which present adiversity in form and appearance. A presentation of the different typesof dams thus employed, with a discussion of the questions pertainingto utility in design and economy in construction, would be exceedinglyvaluable and of general interest. Service reservoirs will receive onlya passing notice, with the hope expressed that some competent authoritywill discuss them in the future.CHAPTER II._Preliminary Studies and Investigations._The preliminary studies and investigations which should be made priorto the construction of any dam for the storage of water have to do with(1) the Catchment Area, (2) the Reservoir basin, and (3) the Dam site.Catchment Area.It is thought desirable to define a number of terms as we proceed,for the purpose of correcting erroneous usage and for a clearerunderstanding of the subject. The catchment area of a reservoir is thatportion of the country naturally draining into it. The watershed isthe boundary of the catchment area and may be correctly defined as thedivide between adjacent drainage systems. In regard to the catchmentarea it is necessary to determine:    1. Its extent and area in square miles.    2. Its topography or the character of its surface.    3. Its hydrography or precipitation and run-off.    4. Its geology, or the character of its soils and subsoils,       and the nature and dip of its rock strata.    5. Its flora, or the extent to which it is clothed with forest       trees or other vegetation.All of these elements affect the volumes of maximum run-off, which isthe one important factor in the construction of earth dams that mustnot be underestimated.If the proposed dam or reservoir is to be located upon a main drainageline; that is, upon a river or stream, it is necessary to know both theflood and low-water discharge of the stream. Frequently no reliabledata on this subject are available, and the engineer must then makesuch a study of the whole situation as will enable him to estimate theminimum and maximum flow with considerable accuracy.There are numerous factors entering into the solution of this firstproblem, such as the shape and length of the catchment area, itsgeneral elevation, the character of its surface, whether mountainous,hilly or flat, barren or timbered.Good topographic maps, if available, furnish valuable data on thesesubjects and it is to be regretted that only a comparatively smallportion of the United States has been thus mapped in detail.The results of stream measurements, if any have been made in thecatchment basin, are especially important: These are usually few inthe high areas, on account of their inaccessibility. The year 1902marked a notable beginning of such measurements in California. In manyparts of the arid region of the United States, the best storage-sitesare situated in the upper or higher portions of the drainage systems.This is especially true of the streams on the Pacific Slope havingtheir source in the High Sierras. As regulators of stream-flow and forpower purposes such storage is peculiarly valuable, while storage forirrigation and domestic uses may be located nearer the valleys and thecenters of population.Frequently the engineer is required to build his dam where no suchdata are available. In such instances he should endeavor to securethe establishment of rain gauges and make measurements of the flow ofthe main stream and its principal tributaries at various places toobtain the desired information. Even this may not suffice, owing to thelimited time at his disposal, and he must resort to the use of certainempirical rules or formulas, and make such comparisons and deductionsfrom known conditions and results as will best answer his purpose.The engineer should know, approximately at least, the normal yield ofthe catchment area, the duration of the minimum and maximum seasonalflow, and the floods he may have to provide against during theconstruction of his dam. These data are absolutely necessary to enablehim to provide ample wasteways for his reservoirs. Many of the failuresof earth dams have been the result of over-topping the embankment,which would have been averted by an ample wasteway. The most notableexample of this kind in recent years was that of the South Fork Dam, atConemaugh, Pennsylvania, in 1889, resulting in what is generally knownas the Johnstown Disaster.There are several empirical rules and formulas for calculating the runoff from catchment areas and for determining the size of spillwaysnecessary to discharge this flow with safety to the dam. The properformula to apply in any given case, with the varying coefficientsof each, involves a thorough knowledge on the part of the designingengineer of the principles upon which the different factors are based.It is unwise and often hazardous to make use of any important hydraulicformula without knowing the history of its derivation. Experimentsare not always properly conducted, and often the deductions therefromare unreliable. A presentation and discussion of these formulas wouldrequire more space than can be given in this study, and the technicalreader must therefore consult for himself, as occasion may require, thevarious authorities cited. Formulas for the discharge or run-off fromcatchment areas, as determined by Messrs. Craig, Dickens, Ryves andothers, are given by most writers on the subject of hydraulics.Reservoir Basin.The next subject of inquiry relates to the reservoir basin. It isnecessary that its area and capacity at different depths should bedefinitely known, and this information can only be obtained by havingthe basin surveyed and contoured. A map should be made showing contoursat intervals of 2 to 10 ft., depending upon the size of the basin andthe use to which the reservoir is to be put. Reservoir basins have beenclassified according to their location as follows:    1. Natural lakes.    2. Natural depressions on main drainage lines.    3. Natural depressions on lateral drainage lines.    4. Arbitrary and artificially constructed basins.Natural lakes may need to be investigated more or less thoroughly todetermine the character of their waters, whether saline, alkalineor fresh. It may also be necessary to know their normal depth andcapacity, and to make a study of their outlet if they have one. In someinstances the storage capacity of a lake may be enormously increased bymeans of a comparatively low and inexpensive embankment.The area of reservoir basin, mean depth, temperature of the water,exposure of wind and sunshine, losses by seepage and evaporation, allhave a bearing upon the available water supply and influence the designof the dam and accessories to the reservoir.In determining the character and suitability of materials forconstructing a dam it is necessary to make a careful study of thesoil and geological formation. This is best accomplished by diggingnumerous test pits over the basin, especially in the vicinity of theproposed dam site; borings alone should never be relied upon for thisinformation. For such an investigation the advisability of borrowingmaterial for dam construction from the reservoir basin is determined.The porous character of the subsoil strata, or the dip and nature ofthe bed rock, may forbid the removal of material from the floor of thebasin, even at a remote distance from the dam site.The area to be flooded should be cleared and grubbed more or lessthoroughly, depending again upon the use for which the water isimpounded. In no instance should timber be left standing below thehigh-water level of the reservoir; and all rubbish liable to float andobstruct the outlet tunnel and spillway during a time of flood shouldbe removed.The accessories to a reservoir, to which reference has been made, maybe enumerated as follows:    1. Outlet pipes or tunnel.    2. Gate tower, screens and controlling devices.    3. Sluiceways for silt or sand.    4. Wasteway channel or weir.    5. Cover, settling basin, aerating devices, etc.Some of these are necessary and common to all classes of reservoirs,while others are employed only in special cases, as for domestic watersupplies. All reservoirs formed by earth embankments must have at leasttwo of these, namely a wasteway, which is its safety valve, and outletpipes or outlet tunnel.It may be stated that the proper location and construction of theoutlet for a reservoir are of vital importance, since either toimproper location or faulty construction may be traced most of thefailures of the past. It is almost impossible to prevent water underhigh pressure from following along pipes and culverts when placed in anearth dam. The pipes and culverts frequently leak, and failure ensues.Failure may result from one or more of the following causes:    1. By improper design and placement of the puddle around the pipes.    2. By resting the pipes upon piers of masonry without continuous       longitudinal support.    3. By reason of subsidence in the cuts of the embankments and       at the core walls, due to the great weight at these points.    4. Leakage due to inherent defects, frost, deterioration, etc.Mr. Beardsmore, the eminent English engineer who built the Dale Dykeembankment at Sheffield which failed in 1864, and who was afterwardsrequested to study and report upon the great reservoirs in Yorkshireand Lancashire, said, after examination and careful study of reservoirembankment construction, that in his opinion there were no conditionsrequiring that a culvert or pipes should be carried through any portionof the made bank. The writer would go even further and say that theonly admissible outlet for a storage reservoir formed by a high earthdam is some form of tunnel through the natural formation at a safedistance from the embankment.Dam Site.The third preliminary study (that relating to the dam site itself) willbe considered under three heads:    1. Location.    2. Physical features, materials, etc.    3. Foundation.LOCATION.The location for a dam is generally determined by the usewhich is to be made of it, or by the natural advantages for storagewhich it may possess. If it be for water power it is very frequentlylocated upon the main stream at the point of greatest declivity. If forstorage it may be, as we have seen, at the head of a river system, onone of its tributaries, or in a valley lower down.The type of dam which should be built at any particular localityinvolves a thorough knowledge, not alone of the catchment area andreservoir basin, but also accurate information regarding the geology ofthe dam site itself. It would be very unwise to decide definitely uponany particular type of dam without first obtaining such information.Too frequently has this been done, causing great trouble and expense,if not resulting in a total failure of the dam.The conditions favorable for an earth dam are usually unfavorable for amasonry structure, and vice versa. Again, there may be local conditionsrequiring some entirely different type.Dams situated upon the main drainage lines of large catchment areas areusually built of stone or concrete masonry, and designed with largesluiceways and spillways for the discharge both of silt and floodwaters. It need scarcely be remarked that, as a rule, such sites arewholly unsuited to earthwork construction. It is said, however, thatevery rule has at least one exception, and this may be true of thoserelating to dam sites, as will appear later under the head of newtypes.In a general way, the location of high earth dams is governed by theconfiguration of the ground forming the storage basin. It may not bepossible, however, to decide upon the best available site withoutcareful preliminary surveys and examinations of the geologicalformation.All earth dams must be provided with a wasteway, ample to discharge themaximum flood tributary to the reservoir. Whatever type of wasteway beadopted, no reliance should ever be put upon the outlet pipes for thispurpose. The outlet should only figure as a factor of safety for thewasteway, insuring, as it were, the accuracy of the estimated flooddischarge. The safety of the dam demands that ample provision be madefor a volume of water in excess of normal flood discharge. This mostnecessary adjunct of earth dams may be an open channel, cut throughthe rim of the reservoir basin, discharging into a side ravine whichenters the main drainage way some distance below the dam. It may benecessary and possible to pierce the rim by means of a tunnel where itslength would not prohibit such a design. Lastly, there may be no otheralternative than the construction of an overfall spillway, at one orboth ends of the embankment. This last method is the least desirable ofany and should be resorted to only when the others are impracticable;even then, the volume of water, local topography, geology, andconstructive materials at hand must be favorable to such a design. Ifthey are not favorable it may be asked, what then? Simply do notattempt to build an earth dam at this site.PHYSICAL FEATURES, MATERIALS, ETC.An investigation of the locationand the physical features of the dam site should include a careful andscientific examination of the materials in the vicinity, to determinetheir suitability for use in construction. An earth embankment cannotbe built without earth, and an earth dam cannot be built with safetywithout the right kind of earth material.Test pits judiciously distributed and situated at different elevationswill indicate whether there is a sufficient amount of suitablematerial within a reasonable distance of the dam. The type of earthdam best suited for any particular locality, and its estimated cost,are thus seen to depend upon the data and information obtained bythese preliminary studies. Economical construction requires the use ofimproved machinery and modern methods of handling materials, but farmore important even than these are the details of construction.FOUNDATION.We may now assume that our preliminary studies relating tothe location and physical features of the dam site are satisfactory.We must next investigate the foundation upon which the dam is to bebuilt. This investigation is sometimes wholly neglected or else done insuch a way as to be practically useless. To merely drive down iron rodsfeeling for so-called bed rock, or to make only a few bore-holes withan earth auger should in no instance be considered sufficient. Boringsmay be found necessary at considerable depths below the surface andin certain classes of material, but dug pits or shafts should alwaysbe resorted to for moderate depths and whenever practicable. Only bysuch means may the true character of the strata underlying the surface,and the nature and condition of the bed rock, if it be reached, becomeknown. If a satisfactory stratum of impermeable material be found it isnecessary also to learn both its thickness and extent. It may prove tobe only a pocket of limited volume, or if found to extend entirelyacross the depression lengthwise of the dam site it may pinch outon lines transversely above or below. Shafts and borings made in thereservoir basin and below the dam site will determine its extent inthis direction, knowledge of which is very important.Fig. 1, showing a longitudinal section of the site of the Yarrow Dam ofthe Liverpool Water-Works, England, illustrates the necessity of suchinvestigation. A bore hole at station 2 + 00 met a large boulder whichat first was erroneously thought to be bed rock. The hole at station 3+ 50 met a stratum of clay which proved to be only a pocket.The relative elevation of the different strata and of the bed rockformation, referred to one common datum, should always be determined.These elevations will indicate both the dip and strike of the rockformation and are necessary for estimating the quantities of materialto be excavated and removed, including estimates of cost. They furnishinformation of value in determining the rate of percolation orfiltration through the different classes of material and the amountof probable seepage, as will appear later. The cost of excavating,draining and preparing the floor or foundation for a dam is often verygreat, amounting to 20 or 30% of the total cost.Fig. 2 is a transverse section of the Yarrow Dam. This particular damhas been selected as fairly representative of English practice andof typical design. It is one of the most widely known earth dams inexistence.[Illustration: FIG. 1.LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF YARROW DAM SITE.][Illustration: FIG. 2.CROSS-SECTION OF YARROW DAM.]At the Yarrow dam site it was necessary to go 97 ft. below the originalsurface to obtain a satisfactory formation or one that was impermeable.A central trench was excavated to bed rock, parallel to the axis of thedam, and filled with clay puddle to form a water-tight connection withthe rock, and prevent the water in the reservoir from passing throughthe porous materials under the body of the embankment. This interestingdam will be more fully described later, when the different types ofearth dams are discussed.CHAPTER III._Outline Study of Soils. Puddle._The following study of soils is merely suggestive and is here givento emphasize the importance of the subject, at the risk of beingconsidered a digression. Soil formations are made in one of three ways:    1. By decomposition of exposed rocks.    2. By transportation or sedimentation of fine and coarse       materials worn from rocks.    3. By transformation into humus of decayed organic matter.The transforming agencies by which soils succeed rocks in geologicalprogression have been classified as follows:    1. Changes of temperature.    2. Water.    3. Air.    4. Organic life._Heat_ and its counter agent frost are the most powerful forces innature, their sensible physical effects being the expansion andcontraction of matter._Water_ has two modes of action, physical and chemical. This agent isthe great destroyer of the important forces, cohesion and friction._Cohesion_ is a force uniting particles of matter and resists theirseparation when the motion attempted is perpendicular to the plane ofcontact. _Friction_ is a force resisting the separation of surfaceswhen motion is attempted which produces sliding. The hydrostaticpressure and resultant effect upon submerged surfaces need to bekept constantly in mind. When the surface is impermeable the line ofpressure is normal to its plane, but when once saturated there are alsohorizontal and vertical lines of pressure. Since the strength of anearth dam depends upon two factors, namely, its weight and frictionalresistance to sliding, the effect of water upon different materialsentering into an earth structure should be most carefully considered.This will therefore occupy a large place in these pages. An earthembankment founded upon rock may become saturated by water forced upinto it from below through cracks and fissures, reducing its lowerstratum to a state of muddy sludge, on which the upper part, howeversound in itself, would slide. The best preliminary step to take in sucha case is to intersect the whole site with wide, dry, stone drains,their depths varying according to the nature of the ground or rock._Air_ contains two ingredients ever active in the process ofdecomposition, carbonic acid and oxygen._Organic Life_ accomplishes its decomposing effect both by physicaland chemical means. The effect of organic matter upon the mineralingredients of the soil may be stated as follows:    1. By their hydroscopic properties they keep the soil moist.    2. Their decomposition yields carbonic acid gas.    3. The acids produced disintegrate the mineral constituents,       reducing insoluble matter to soluble plant food.    4. Nitric acid results in _nitrates_, which are the most       valuable form of nutritive nitrogen, while ammonia and the       other salts that are formed are themselves direct food for       plants._Vegetable Humus_ is not the end of decomposition of organic matter,but an intermediate state of transformation. Decay is a process almostidentical with combustion, where the products are the same, and the endis the formation of water and carbonic acid, with a residue of mineralash. The conditions essential to organic decomposition are also thosemost favorable to combustion or oxidation, being (1) access of air, (2)presence of moisture, and (3) application of heat.Now the coperation of these chemical and physical forces, which areever active, is called weathering. Slate rock, for instance, weathersto clay, being impregnated with particles of mica, quartz, chlorite andhornblend. Shales also weather to clay, resulting often in a type ofearth which is little more than silicate of aluminum with iron oxideand sand.In the vicinity of the Tabeaud Dam, recently built under the personalsupervision of the author, the construction of which will be describedlater, there is to be found a species of potash mica, which indecomposing yields a yellow clay (being ochre-colored from the presenceof iron), mixed with particles of undecomposed mica. This materialis subject to expansion, and by reason of its lack of grit and itsunctuous character it was rejected or used very sparingly. Analysis ofthis material gave, Silica, 54.1 to 59.5%; potash, 1.5 to 2.3%; soda,2.7 to 3.7%.Soil analysis may be either mechanical or chemical. For purposes ofearthwork, we are most interested in the former, having to deal withthe physical properties of matter. Chemical analysis, however, willoften afford information of great value regarding certain materialsentering into the construction of earth dams. The most importantphysical properties are:    (1) Weight and specific gravity.    (2) Coefficient of friction and angle of repose.    (3) Structure and coloring ingredients.    (4) Behavior toward water.There are two distinct methods of mechanical analysis: (1) Granulatingwith sieves, having round holes. (2) Elutriating with water, theprocess being known as silt analysis.It would require a large volume to present the subject of soil analysisin any way commensurate with its importance. Experiments bearing uponthe subjects of imbibition, permeability, capillarity, absorption andevaporation, of different earth materials, are equally interesting andimportant.[1]The permeability of soils will be discussed incidentally in connectionwith certain infiltration experiments to be given later.Puddle._Puddle_ without qualification may be defined as clayey and gravellyearth thoroughly wetted and mixed, having a consistency of stiff mudor mortar. Puddle in which the predominating ingredient of the mixtureis pure clay, is called _clay puddle_. _Gravel puddle_ contains a muchhigher percentage of grit and gravel than the last-named and yet issupposed to have enough clayey material to bind the matrix together andto fill all the voids in the gravel.The term _earthen concrete_ may also be applied to this class ofmaterial, especially when only a small quantity of water is used inthe mixture. These different kinds of puddling materials may be foundin natural deposits ready for use, only requiring the addition of theproper amount of water. It is usually necessary, however, to mix,artificially, or combine the different ingredients in order to obtainthe right proportions. Some engineers think grinding in a pug-millabsolutely essential to obtain satisfactory results.Puddle is handled very much as cement concrete, which is so wellunderstood that detailed description is hardly necessary. Instead oftampers, sharp cutting implements are usually employed in puttingpuddle into place. Trampling with hoofed animals is frequently resortedto, both for the purpose of mixing and compacting.As has been stated, clays come from the decomposition of crystalinerocks. The purest clay known (kaolin) is composed of alumina, silicaand water. The smaller the proportion of silica the more water it willabsorb and retain. Dry clay will absorb nearly one-third of its weightof water, and clay in a naturally moist condition 1-6 to 1-8 its weightof water. The eminent English engineers, Baker and Latham, put thepercentage of absorption by clayey soils as high as 40 to 60%. Pureclays shrink about 5% in drying, while a mixture by weight of 1 clayto 2 sand will shrink about 3%. It follows, then, that the larger thepercentage of clay there may be in a mixture the greater will be boththe expansion and the contraction.Clay materials may be very deceptive in some of their physicalproperties, being hard to pick under certain conditions, and yet whenexposed to air and water will rapidly disintegrate. Beds of clay,marl and very fine sand are liable to slip when saturated, becomingsemi-fluid in their nature, and will run like cream.The cohesive and frictional resistances of clays becoming thus verymuch reduced when charged with water, a too liberal use of thismaterial is to be deprecated. The ultimate particles forming clays,viewed under the microscope, are seen to be flat and scale-like, whilethose of sands are more cubical and spherical. This is a mechanicaldifference which ought to be apparent to even a superficial observerand yet has escaped recognition by many who have vainly attempted adefinition of _quicksand_.Mr. Strange recommends filling the puddle trench with material havingthree parts soil and two parts sand. After the first layer next to bedrock foundation, which he kneads and compacts, he would put the layersin dry, then water and work it by treading, finally covering to avoidits drying out and cracking.Prof. Philipp Forchheimer, of Gratz, Austria, one of the highestauthorities and experimentalists, affirms that if a sandy soil containsclay to such an extent that the clay fills up the interstices betweenthe grains of sand entirely the compound is practically impervious.Mr. Herbert M. Wilson, C. E., in his Manual of IrrigationEngineering, recommends the following as an ideal mixture of materials:                       Cu. yds.    Coarse gravel        1.00    Fine gravel          0.35    Sand                 0.15    Clay                 0.20                                 Total            1.70This mixture, when rolled and compacted, should give 1.25 cu. yds. inbulk, thus resulting in 26% compression.Mr. Clemens Herschel suggests the following test of good bindinggravel: Mix with water in a pail to the consistency of moist earth;if on turning the pail upside down the gravel remains in the pail it isfit for use, otherwise it is to be rejected. For _puddling material_he would use such a proportion as will render the water invisible.CHAPTER IV._The Tabeaud Dam, California._The Tabeaud Dam, in Amador County, Cal., built under the supervisionof the author for the Standard Electric Co., is an example of thehomogeneous earth dam. A somewhat fuller description and discussionwill be given of this dam than of any other, not on account of itsgreater importance or interest, but because it exemplifies certainprinciples of construction upon which it is desired to put specialemphasis. This dam was described in Engineering News of July 10, 1902,to which the reader is referred for more complete information than isgiven here.[Illustration: FIG. 3.PLAN OF TABEAUD RESERVOIR, WITH CONTOURS.][Illustration: FIG. 4.PLAN OF TABEAUD DAM, SHOWING BED ROCK DRAINAGESYSTEM.][Illustration: FIG. 5.DETAILS OF BED ROCK DRAINS AT THE TABEAUD DAM.]Fig. 3 is a contour map of the Tabeaud Reservoir, showing the relativelocations of the dam, wasteway and outlet tunnel. Fig. 4 shows the bedrock drainage system and the letters upon the drawing will assist infollowing the explanation given in the text. The whole up-stream halfof the dam site was stripped to bed rock. As the work of excavationadvanced pockets of loose alluvial soil were encountered, which weresuggestive of a refill, possibly the result of placer mining operationsduring the early mining days of California. In addition to this werefound thin strata of sand and gravel deposited in an unconformablemanner. The slate bed rock near the up-stream toe of the dam was badlyfissured and yielded considerable water. A quartz vein from 1 to 2 ft.in thickness crossed the dam site about 150 ft. above the axis of thedam. The slate rock above this vein or fault line was quite variable inhardness and dipped at an angle of 40 degrees toward the reservoir.[Illustration: FIG. 6.VIEW OF BED ROCK TRENCHES, TABEAUD DAM.]The rear drain terminates at a weir box (Z) outside of the down-streamslope at a distance of 500 ft. from the axis of the dam. This drainbranches at the down-stream side of the central trench, (Y), one branchbeing carried up the hillside to high-water level (W) at the North endof the dam, and the other to the same elevation at the South end (X).Fig. 5 shows how these drains were constructed. After the removal ofall surface soil and loose rock, a trench 5 to 10 ft. wide was cut intothe solid rock, the depth of cutting varying with the character of thebed rock. Upon the floor of this trench a small open drain was made bynotching the bed rock and by means of selected stones of suitable sizeand hardness. The stringers and cap-stones were carefully selected andlaid, so that no undue settlement or displacement might occur by reasonof the superincumbent weight of the dam. All crevices were carefullyfilled with spawls and the whole overlaid 18 ins. in depth with brokenstone 1 to 3 ins. in diameter. Upon this layer of broken stone andfine gravel was deposited choice clay puddle, thoroughly wetted andcompacted, refilling the trenches.[Illustration: FIG. 7.VIEW OF NORTH TRENCH, TABEAUD DAM.][Illustration: FIG. 8.VIEW OF SOUTH TRENCH, TABEAUD DAM.][Illustration: FIG. 9.VIEW OF MAIN CENTRAL DRAIN, TABEAUD DAM.]These drains served a useful purpose during construction, in dryingoff the surface of the dam after rains. The saturation of the outerslope of the dam by water creeping along the line of contact shouldthus be prevented, and the integrity or freedom from saturation of thedown-stream half should be preserved. It is believed that the puddleoverlying these rock drains will effectually prevent any water fromentering the body of the embankment by upward pressure and that thedrains will thus forever act as efficient safeguards.The main drain was extended, temporarily during construction, fromthe central trench (Fig. 4), to the up-stream toe of the dam. Thiswas cut 5 or 6 ft. deep into solid rock, below the general level ofthe stripped surface. Fig. 6 is reproduced from a photograph of thistrench. An iron pipe 2 ins. in diameter was imbedded in Portland cementmortar and concrete, and laid near the bottom of the trench.At the point (B) where the quartz vein (already described) intersectedthis drain, two branch drains were made, following the fault well intothe hill on both sides. Figs. 7 and 8 are views of the North and Southtrenches, respectively. These trenches were necessary to take care ofthe springs issuing along the quartz vein. This water led to a point(N, Fig. 4) near the up-stream toe, by means of the drain shown in Fig.9.The lateral drains and that portion of the main central drain extendingfrom their junction (B) to a point (N) about 230 ft. from the axisof the dam have pieces of angle iron or wooden Y-fluming laid on thebottom of the trenches immediately over the 2-in. pipe, as shown inFigs. 7, 8 and 9. These are covered in turn with Portland cementmortar, concrete, clay puddle and earth fill. The water will naturallyflow along the line of least resistance, and consequently will followalong the open space between the angle irons and the outside of thepipe until it reaches the chamber and opening in the pipe, permittingthe water to enter and be conveyed through the imbedded pipe-line tothe rear drain. This point of entry is a small chamber in a solidcross-wall of rich cement mortar, and is the only point where watercan enter this pipe-line, the two branches entering the wells and thestand-pipe at their junction (soon to be described) having been closed.That portion of the foundation between the axis of the dam and thequartz vein, a distance of about 160 ft., was very satisfactory,without fissures or springs of water. In this portion the 2-in. pipewas imbedded in mortar and concrete without angle irons, and thecontinuity of the trench broken by numerous cross-trenches cut intothe rock and filled with concrete and puddle. It is believed that noseepage water will ever pass through this portion of the dam. If anyshould ever find its way under the puddle and through the bed rockformation, the rear drain, with its hillside branches, will carry itaway and prevent the saturation of the lower or down-stream half of thedam.[Illustration: FIG. 10.VIEW OF TABEAUD DAM WHEN ABOUT HALF COMPLETED.]At the up-stream toe of the embankment, two wells or sumps (shown atS and K, Fig. 4) were cut 10 or 12 ft. deeper than the main trench,which received the water entering the inner toe puddle trench duringconstruction. This water was disposed of partly by pumping and partlyby means of the 2-in. branch pipes leading into and from these wells.At their junction (J) a 2-in. stand-pipe was erected, which was carriedvertically up through the embankment, and finally filled with cement.The branch pipes from the wells were finally capped and the wellsfilled with broken stone, as previously mentioned.EMBANKMENT.As has been said, the upper surface of the slate bed rockwas found to be badly fissured, especially near the up-stream toe ofthe dam, and as the average depth below the surface of the ground wasnot very great, it was thought best to lay bare the bed rock over theentire upper half of the dam site. Had the depth been much greater,it would have been more economical and possibly sufficient to haveput reliance in a puddle trench, alone, for securing a water-tightconnection between the foundation and the body of the dam.At the axis of the dam and near the inner toe, where the puddle wallsabutted against the hillsides, the excavation always extended to bedrock. Vertical steps and offsets were avoided and the cuts were madelarge enough for horses to turn in while tramping, these animals beingused, singly and in groups, to mix and compact the puddle and thuslessen the labor of tamping by hand. In plan, the hillside contactof natural and artificial surfaces presents a series of corrugatedlines, (as is clearly shown in Fig. 4.) After all loose and porousmaterials had been removed, the stripped surface and the slopes of allexcavations were thoroughly wetted from time to time by means of hoseand nozzle, the water being delivered under pressure. Fig. 10 is a viewof the dam taken when it was about half finished and shows the work inprogress.The face puddle shown in Fig. 11 was used merely to make assurancedoubly sure and was not carried entirely up to the top of the dam.The earth of which the dam was constructed may be described as ared gravelly clay, and in the judgment of the author is almost idealmaterial for the purpose. Physical tests and experiments made with thematerials at different times during construction gave the followingaverage results:                                                               Pounds.

Ingood material one trap with eight Fresno-scraper teams could fill 25wagons per hour. The average length of haul for the entire work wasabout 1,320 ft.The original plans and specifications were adhered to throughout, withthe single exception that the central puddle wall was not carried aboveelevation 1,160, as shown on Figs. 11 and 12, more attention beinggiven to the inner face puddle. This modification in the original planswas made because of the character of the materials available and theexcellent results obtained in securing an homogeneous earthen concrete,practically impervious.[Illustration: FIG. 11.DIMENSION SECTION OF TABEAUD DAM.]The top of the embankment was maintained basin-shaped duringconstruction, being lower at the axis than at the outer slopes by 1-10,to the height below the finished crown. This gave a grade of about 1in 25 from the edges toward the center, resulting in the followingadvantages:(1) Insuring a more thorough wetting of the central portion of the dam;any excess of water in this part would be readily taken care of by thecentral cross drains.(2) In wetting the finished surface prior to depositing a new layerof material, water from the sprinkling wagons would naturally draintowards the center and insure keeping the surface wet; the layers beingcarried, as a rule, progressively outward from the center.(3) It centralized the maximum earth pressure and enabled thedepositing of material in layers perpendicular to the slopes.(4) It facilitated rolling and hauling on lines parallel to the axis ofthe dam, and discouraged transverse and miscellaneous operations.(5) It finally insured better compacting by the tramping of teams intheir exertions to overcome the grade.[Illustration][Illustration: FIG. 12.CROSS AND LONGITUDINAL SECTIONS OF TABEAUDDAM.]The specifications stipulated that the body of the dam should be builtup in layers not exceeding 6 ins. in thickness for the first 60 ft.,and not exceeding 8 ins. above that elevation. The finished layersafter rolling varied slightly in thickness, the daily average per monthbeing as follows:    April                     4  ins.    May                       3      June                      4       July                      4      August                    5       September                 6       October                   7       November and December     8   During the last few months more than one whole layer constituted thedays work, so that a single layer was seldom as thick as the dailyaverage indicates.It was stipulated in the specifications that the up-stream half of thedam was to be made of selected material and the lower half of lesschoice material, not designated waste. Waste material was describedas meaning all vegetable humus, light soil, roots, and rock exceeding 5lbs. in weight, too large to pass through a 4-in. ring.It may be well to define the expression selected material,so commonly used in specifications for earth dams. In England,for instance, it is said to refer to materials which insure_water-tightness_, while in India it refers to those employed to obtain_stability_. It ought to mean the best material available, selected bythe engineer to suit the requirements of the situation.The method employed in building the body of the embankment may bedescribed as follows:(1) The top surface of every finished layer of material was sprinkledand harrowed prior to putting on a new layer. The sprinkling wagonspassed over the older finished surface immediately before eachwagon-row was begun. This insured a wetted surface and assisted thewheels of the loaded wagons, as well as the harrows, to roughen, theold surface prior to depositing a new layer.(2) The material was generally deposited in rows parallel to the axisof the dam. However, along the line of contact, at the margins of theembankment, the earth was often deposited in rows crosswise of thedam, permitting a selection of the choicest materials and greatlyfacilitating the work of graders and rollers.(3) Rock pickers with their carts were continually passing along therows gathering up all roots, rocks and other waste materials.[Illustration: FIG. 13.VIEW OF TABEAUD DAM IMMEDIATELY AFTERCOMPLETION.](4) The road-graders drawn by six horses leveled down the tops ofthe wagon-loads, and if the material was dry the sprinkling wagonsimmediately passed over the rows prior to further grading. When thematerial was naturally moist the grader continued the leveling processuntil the earth was evenly spread. The depth or thickness of the layercould be regulated to a nicety by properly spacing the rows and theindividual loads. The grader brought the layer to a smooth surfaceand of uniform thickness, and nothing more could be desired for thisoperation.(5) After the graders had finished, the harrows passed over the newlayer to insure the picking out of all roots and rocks, followedimmediately by the sprinkling wagons.(6) Finally the rollers thoroughly compacted the layer of earth,generally passing to and fro over it lengthwise of the dam. Along theline of contact at the ends, however, they passed crosswise. Then againthey frequently went around a portion of the surface until the wholewas hard and solid.Two rollers were in use constantly, each drawn by six horses. Oneweighed five tons and the other eight tons, giving respectively 166 and200 lbs. pressure per lin. in. They were not grooved, but the smoothsurface left by the rollers was always harrowed and cut up more orless by the loaded wagons passing over the surface previously wetted.The wagons when loaded gave 750 lbs. pressure per lin. in., and theheavy teams traveling wherever they could do the most effective workcompacted the materials better even than the rollers.Several test pits which were dug into the dam during constructionshowed that there were no distinct lines traceable between the layersand no loose or dry spots, but that the whole mass was solid andhomogeneous.A careful record is being kept of the amount of settlement of theTabeaud Dam. It will be of interest to record here the fact that justone year after date of completion the settlement amounted to 0.2 ft.,with 90 ft. depth of water in the reservoir.Water was first turned into the reservoir five months after the dam wasfinished. The very small amount of settlement here shown emphasizesmore eloquently than words the authors concluding remarks relating tothe importance of thorough consolidation, by artificial means, of theembankment. (See p. 64, Secs. 6 to 8.)OUTLET TUNNEL.The outlet for the reservoir is a tunnel 2,903 ft. inlength, through a ridge of solid slate rock formation, which was veryhard and refractory. At the north or reservoir end of the tunnel, thereis an open cut 350 ft. long, with a maximum depth of 26 ft.Near the south portal of the tunnel and in the line of pressure pipesconnecting the petty reservoir above with the power-house below,is placed a receiver, connected with the tunnel by means of a shortpipe-line, 60 ins. in diameter.A water-tight bulkhead of brick and concrete masonry is placed in thetunnel, at a point about 175 ft. distant from the receiver. In the lineof 60-in. riveted steel pipe, which connects the reservoir and tunnelwith the receiver, there is placed a cast iron chamber for entrappingsilt or sand, with a branch pipe 16 ins. in diameter leading into aside ravine through which sand or silt thus collected can be wasted orwashed out. By the design of construction thus described, it will beseen that all controlling devices, screens, gates, etc., are at thesouth end of the tunnel and easily accessible.WASTEWAY.The wasteway for the reservoir is an open cut through itsrim, 48 ft. in width and 300 ft. long. The sill of the spillway is 10ft. below the crown of the dam. The reservoir having less than twosquare miles of catchment area, and the feeding canals being undercomplete control, the dam can never be over-topped by a flood. Fig.3 shows the relative location of the dam, outlet tunnel and wastewaychannel.Almost the whole of the embankment forming the Tabeaud Dam, notincluded in the foundation work, was built in less than eight months.The contractors outfit was the best for the purpose the writer hasever seen. After increasing his force from time to time he finally hadthe following equipment:      1 steam shovel (1 yds. capacity),     37 patent dump wagons,     11 stick-wagons and rock-carts,     39 buck-scrapers (Fresno pattern),     21 wheel scrapers,      3 road-graders,      3 sprinkling wagons,      2 harrows,      2 rollers (5 and 8-ton),    233 men,    416 horses and mules,      8 road and hillside plows.STATISTICS.The following data relating to the Tabeaud Dam Reservoirwill conclude this description:DAM.

Homogeneous earth dams, either with or without a puddle       trench.    2. Earth dams with a puddle core or puddle face.    3. Earth dams with a core wall of brick, rubble or concrete       masonry.    4. New types, composite structures.    5. Rock-fill dams with earth inner slope.    6. Hydraulic-fill dams of earth and gravel.The writer proposes to give an example of each type, with such remarksupon their distinctive features and relative merits as he thinks may beinstructive.Earth Dams with Puddle Core Wall or Face.YARROW DAM.The Yarrow dam of the Liverpool Water-Works is a notableexample of the second type, (a section of which is shown in Fig. 2.)An excavation 97 ft. in depth was made to bed rock through differentstrata of varying thickness, and a trench 24 ft. wide was cut withside slopes 1 on 1 for the first 10 ft. in depth below the surface.The trench was then carried down through sand, gravel and boulderswith sides sloping 1 in 12. The upper surface of the shale bed rockwas found to be soft, seamy and water-bearing. Pumps were installedto keep the water out of the trench while it was being cut 4 or 5 ft.deeper into the shale. The lower portion was then walled up on eitherside with brickwork 14 ins. in thickness, and the trench between thewalls was filled with concrete, made in the proportion of 1 of cement,1 of sand and 2 of gravel or broken stone. By so doing a dry bed wassecured for the foundation of the puddle wall. Two lines of 6-in. pipeswere laid on the bed rock, outside of the walls, and pipes 9 ins. indiameter extended vertically above the top of the brickwork some 27ft. These pipes were filled with concrete, after disconnecting thepumps. After refilling the trench with puddle to the original surface,a puddle wall was carried up simultaneous with the embankment, having adecreasing batter of 1 in 12, which gave a width of 6 ft. at the top.This form of construction is very common in England and Figs. 14 and 15show two California dams, the Pilarcitos and San Andres, of the samegeneral type.[Illustration: FIG. 14.CROSS-SECTION OF PILARCITOS DAM.][Illustration: FIG. 15.CROSS-SECTION OF SAN ANDRES DAM.]ASHTI EMBANKMENT.This is not a very high embankment, but being typicalof modern dams in British India, where the puddle is generally carriedonly to the top of the original surface of the ground, and not upthrough the body of the dam, it is thought worthy of mention. Fig. 16shows a section of this embankment, which is located in the SholapurDistrict, India.The central portion of this dam above the puddle trench is made ofselected black soil; then on either side is placed Brown Soil,finishing on the outer slopes with Murum. Trap rock decomposes firstinto a friable stony material, known in India as Murum or Murham.This material further decomposes into various argillaceous earths, themost common being the black cotton soil mentioned above.[Illustration: FIG. 16.CROSS-SECTION OF ASHTI TANK EMBANKMENT.]This particular dam has been adversely criticised on account of thelack of uniformity in the character of the materials composing thebank. It is claimed that the materials being of different density andweight, unequal settlement will result, and lines of separation willform between the different kinds of materials.Earth materials do not unite or combine with timber or masonry, butthere are no such distinct lines of transition and separation betweendifferent earth materials themselves as Fig. 16 would seem to indicate.Puddle Trench.In the last three dams mentioned (Figs. 14, 15, 16) the puddletrenches are made with vertical sides or vertical steps and offsets.A wedge-shaped trench certainly has many advantages over this form.Puddle being plastic, consolidates as the dam settles, filling thelowest parts by sliding on its bed. It thus has a tendency to breakaway from the portion supported by the step, and a further tendency toleave the vertical side, thus forming cracks and fissures for water toenter. The argument advanced by those holding a different view, namely,that it is difficult to dress the sides of a trench to a steep batterand to timber it substantially, has in reality little weight when putto practical test. Mr. F. P. Stearns, in describing the recent workof excavating the cut-off trench of the North Dike of the Wachusettreservoir, Boston, said it was found to be both better and cheaperto excavate a trench with slopes than with vertical sides protectedby sheeting. He favored this shape in case of pile-work and for thepurpose also of wedging materials together.Mr. Wm. J. McAlpines Specifications for Earth Dams, representing thebest practice of 25 years ago, which are frequently cited, contain thefollowing description of how to prepare the up-stream floor of the dam:    Remove the pervious and decaying matter by breaking up the natural    soil and by stepping up the sides of the ravine; also by several    toothed trenches across the bottom and up the sides.One of Mr. McAlpines well known axioms was, water abhors anangle. The stepping and toothed trenches above specified neednot necessarily be made with vertical planes, but should be made bymeans of inclined and horizontal planes. The writers experience andobservation leads him to think that all excavations in connection withearth dams requiring a refill should be made wedge-shaped so that thepressure of the superincumbent materials in settling will wedge thematerial tighter and tighter together and fill every cavity. A paperby Mr. Wm. L. Strange, C. E., on Reservoirs with high Earthen Damsin Western India, published in the Proceedings of the Institution ofCivil Engineers, Vol. 132, (1898), is one of the best contributions tothe literature on this subject, known to the writer. Mr. Strange statesthat    the rate of filtration of a soil depends upon its porosity,    which governs the frictional resistance to flow, and the    slope and length of the filamentary channels along which the    water may be considered to pass. It is evident, therefore,    that the direct rate of infiltration in a homogeneous soil    must decrease from the top to the bottom of the puddle    trench. The best section for a puddle trench is thus a    wedge, such as an open excavation would give. It is true    that the uppermost infiltrating filaments when stopped by    the puddle, will endeavor to get under it, but a depth will    eventually be reached when the frictional resistance along    the natural passages will be greater than that due to the    transverse passage of the puddle trench, and it is when    this occurs that the latter may be stopped without danger,    as the _filtration to it_ will be less than that    _through_ it. This depth requires to be determined in    each case, but in fairly compact Indian soils 30 feet will    be a fair limit.Puddle Wall vs. Puddle Trench.There is a diversity of opinion among engineers in regard to the properplace for the puddle in dam construction. Theoretically, the innerface would be preferable to the center, for the purpose of preventingany water from penetrating the embankment. It is well known that allmaterials immersed in water lose weight in proportion to the volume ofwater they displace. If the upper half of the dam becomes saturatedit must neccesarily lose both weight and stability. Its full cohesivestrength can only be maintained by making it impervious in some way.The strength of an earth dam depends upon three factors:    1. Weight.    2. Frictional resistance against sliding.    3. Cohesiveness of its materials.These can be known only so long as no water penetrates the body ofthe dam. When once saturated the resultant line of pressure is nolonger normal to the inner slope, for the reason that there is now aforce tending to slide the dam horizontally and another due to thehydrostatic head tending to lift it vertically. When the water slopeis impervious the horizontal thrust is sustained by the whole dam andnot by the lower half alone. When once a passage is made into the bodyof the dam, the infiltration water will escape along the line of leastresistance, and if there be a fissure it may become a cavity and thecavity a breach.For practical reasons, mainly on account of the difficulty ofmaintaining a puddle face on the inner slope of a dam, which wouldrequire a very flat slope, puddle is generally placed at the center asa core wall.It was thought possible at the Tabeaud dam to counteract the tendencyof the face puddle to slough off into the reservoir by use of a brokenstone facing of riprap. This covering will protect the puddle from thedeteriorating effects of air and sun whenever the water is drawn lowand also resists the pressure at the inner toe of the dam.Percolation and Infiltration.The earlier authorities on the subject of percolation and infiltrationof water are somewhat conflicting in their statements, if not confusedin their ideas. We are again impressed with the importance of a clearlydefined and definite use of terms. The temptation and tendency to uselanguage synonymously is very great, but it is unscientific and mustresult in confusion of thought. Let it be observed that _filtration_is the process of mechanically separating and removing the undissolvedparticles floating in a liquid. That _infiltration_ is the processby which water (or other liquid) enters the interstices of porousmaterial. That _percolation_ is the action of a liquid passing throughsmall interstices; and, finally, that _seepage_ is the amount of fluidwhich has percolated through porous materials.Many recent authorities are guilty of confusion in thought orexpression, as will appear from the following:One says, for instance, that a    rock is water-tight when non-absorbent of water, but that a soil    is not water-tight unless it will absorb an enormous quantity of    water.This would seem to indicate that super-saturation and not pressure isnecessary to increase the water-tightness of earth materials.Again, in a recent discussion regarding the saturation and percolationof water through the lower half of a reservoir embankment, it wasremarked, that    the more compact the material of which the bank is built,    the steeper will be the slope of saturation.Exception was taken to this, and the statement made, that    _with compact material_, the sectional area of flow    is larger below a given level with porous material, and as    the bank slope is one determining factor of the line of    saturation, this line tends to approach the slope line;    while with porous material in a down-stream bank, the slope    of saturation is steeper and the area of the flow less.In reply to this, it was said,    that it is obvious that if the embankment below the core    wall is built of material so compact as to be impervious    to water, no water passing through the wall will enter it,    and the slope of saturation will be vertical. If it be    less compact, water will enter more or less according to    the head or pressure, and according to its compactness or    porosity, producing a slope of saturation whose inclination    is dependent on the frictional resistance encountered by    the water. And the bank will be tight whenever the slope of    saturation remains within the figure of the embankment.Further,    that it was necessary to distinguish between the slope assumed    by water _retained in_ an embankment and that taken by water    _passing through_ an embankment made of material too porous to    retain it; where the rule is clearly reversed and where the more    porous the material the steeper the slope at which water will run    through it at a given rate.These citations are sufficient to emphasize the importance of exactdefinition of terms and clear statement of principles.The latest experiments relating to the percolation of water throughearth materials and tests determining the stability of soils arethose made during the investigations at the New Croton Dam andJerome Park Reservoir, New York, and those relating to the NorthDike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Boston. These are very interestingand instructive, and it is here proposed to discuss the results andconclusions reached in these cases, after some introductory remarksreciting the order of events.NEW CROTON DAM.In June, 1901, the Board of Croton AqueductCommissioners of New York requested a board of expert engineers,consisting of Messrs. J. J. R. Croes, E. F. Smith and E. Sweet, toexamine the plans for the construction of the earth portion of the NewCroton Dam, and also the core wall and embankment of the Jerome Parkreservoir.This report was published in full in Engineering News for Nov. 28,1901. It was followed in subsequent issues of the said journal bysupplemental and individual reports from each member of the boardof experts, and by articles from Messrs. A. Fteley, who originallydesigned the works, A. Craven, formerly division engineer on this work,and W. R. Hill, at that time chief engineer of the Croton AqueductCommission.After describing the New Croton Dam, the board of experts preface theirremarks on the earth embankment by saying that    it has been abundantly proven that up to a height of 60    or 70 ft. an embankment founded on solid material and    constructed of well-selected earth, properly put in place,    is fully as durable and safe as a masonry wall and far less    costly.There are, in fact, no less than 22 earth dams in use to-day exceeding90 ft. in height, and twice that number over 70 ft. in height. Five ofthe former are in California, and several of these have been in useover 25 years. The writer fails to appreciate the reason for limitingthe safe height of earth dams to 60 or 70 ft.The New Croton Dam was designed as a composite structure of masonryand earth, crossing the Croton Valley at a point three miles from theHudson River. The earth portion was to join the masonry portion at apoint where the latter was 195 ft. high from the bed rock. The Boardthought there was no precedent for such a design and no necessityfor this form of construction. The point to be considered here waswhether a dam like this can be made sufficiently impermeable to waterto prevent the outer slope from becoming saturated and thus liable toslide and be washed out.The design of the embankment portion was similar to all the earth damsof the Croton Valley. In the center is built a wall of rubble masonry,generally founded upon solid rock, and intended to prevent the freeseepage of water, but not heavy enough to act alone as a retaining wallfor either water or earth.Fig. 17 shows a section which is typical of most New England earthdams; and Fig. 18, the sections of two of the Croton Valley dams, NewYork water supply. These dams all have masonry core walls, illustratingthe third type of dams given on page 33.[Illustration: FIG. 17.CROSS-SECTION OF A TYPICAL NEW ENGLAND DAM.]The board of experts made numerous tests by means of borings intothe Croton Valley dams to determine the slope of saturation. Thehydraulic laboratory of Cornell University also made tests of thepermeability of several samples of materials taken from pits. All thematerials examined were found to be permeable and when exposed to waterto disintegrate and assume a flat slope, the surface of which wasdescribed as slimy.Pipe wells were driven at different places into the dams and the lineof saturation was determined by noting the elevations at which thewater stood in them. In all the dams the entire bank on the water sideof the core wall appeared to be completely saturated. Water was alsofound to be standing in the embankment on the down-stream side of thecore wall. The extent of saturation of the outer bank varied greatly,due to the difference in materials, the care taken in building them,and their ages. Fig. 19 gives the average slopes of saturation asdetermined by these borings.The experts stated    that the slope of the surface of the saturation in the bank    is determined by the solidity of the embankment: The more    compact the material of which the bank is built, the steeper    will be the slope of saturation.As a result of their investigations, the experts were of the opinionthat the slope of saturation in the best embankments made of thematerial found in the Croton Valley is about 35 ft. per 100 ft., andthat with materials less carefully selected and placed the slope may be20 ft. per 100 ft.Further, that taking the loss of head in passing through the core wall,and the slope assumed by the plane of saturation, the maximum safeheight of an earth dam with its top 20 ft. above water level in thereservoir and its outside slope 2 on 1, is 63 to 102.5 ft. This is aremarkable finding in view of the fact that the Titicus Dam, one of theCroton Valley dams examined, has a maximum height above bed rock of 110ft. and has been in use seven years. This dam is not a fair example tocite in proof of their conclusion, because its _effective head_ is onlyabout 46 ft.[2][Illustration: BOG BROOK DAM.][Illustration: MIDDLE BRANCH DAM.FIG. 18.CROSS-SECTION OF TWO CROTON VALLEY DAMS, SHOWING SATURATION.]Mr. Fteley gave as a reason for the elevation of the water slopefound in the outer bank of the Croton dams the fact of their beingconstructed of fine materials and stated that with comparatively porousmaterials they would have shown steeper slopes of saturation.Mr. Craven argued that all dams will absorb more or less water, andthat porosity is merely a degree of compactness; that slope impliesmotion in water, and that there is no absolute retention of water inthe outer bank of a dam having its base below the plane indicated bythe loss of head in passing through the inner bank and then through afurther obstruction of either masonry or puddle; that there is simply apartial retention, with motion through the bank governed by the degreeof porosity of the material.Fig. 19 is a graphical interpretation of the conclusion reached by theboard of experts, as already given on page 41. A is an ideal profileof a homogeneous dam with the inner slope 3 on 1 and the outer slope 2on 1. The top width is made 25 ft. for a dam having 90 ft. effectivehead, the high-water surface in the reservoir being 10 ft. below thecrest of the dam. This ideal profile is a fair average of all the earthdams of the world. Not having a core wall to augment the loss of head,it fairly represents what might be expected of such a dam built ofCroton Valley material, compacted in the usual way. It should be notedthat the intersection of the plane of saturation with the rear slope ofthe dam at such high elevation as shown indicates an excessive seepageand a dangerously unstable condition.Preliminary Study of Profile for Dam.The preliminary calculations for designing a profile for an earth damare simple and will here be illustrated by an example. Let us assumethe following values:    a. Central height of dam, 100 ft.    b. Maximum depth of water, 90 ft., with surface 10 ft. below       crest of dam.    c. Effective head, 90 ft.    d. Weight of water, 62.5 lbs. per cu. ft.    e. Weight of material, 125 lbs. per cu. ft.    f. Coefficient of friction, 1.00, or equal to the weight.    g. Factor of safety against sliding, 10.    The width corresponding to the vertical pressure of 1 ft. is,    (62.5  10)/125 = 5 ft.[Illustration][Illustration: FIG. 19.GRAPHICAL INTERPRETATION OF STUDIES OF BOARD OFEXPERTS ON THE ORIGINAL EARTH PORTION OF THE NEW CROTON DAM.]The hydrostatic pressure per square foot at 90 ft. depth is, 62.5  90= 5,625 lbs.The dam, having a factor of safety of 10, must present a resistance of,5,625  10 = 56,250 lbs., or 28 tons per square foot.The theoretical width of bank corresponding to 90 ft. head and a factorof 10 is shown by the dotted triangle (A-B-B) to be 450 ft., (B, Fig.19) with slopes 2 on 1.To this must be added the width due to the height of crest above thewater surface in the reservoir and the width of crest.The former would be, 2 (2  10) = 50 ft., and the latter byTrautwines rule, 2 + 2100 = 22 ft., giving a total base width of 522ft.Let us now assume that the slope of saturation may be 35 ft. per 100ft. We observe that this intersects the base 40 ft. within the outertoe of the bank slope. If the plane of saturation was 33 ft. per 100,it would just reach the outer toe. It would be advisable to enlargethis section by adding a 10-ft. berm at the 50-ft. level, having aslope not less than 3 on 1 for the up-stream face, and two 15-ft. bermson the down-stream face, having slopes 2 on 1. The additional widthof base due to these modifications in our profile amounts to 65 ft.,giving a total base width of 587 ft., and increasing the factor ofsafety from 10 to 13. It should be remembered that if the bank becomessaturated this factor of safety may be reduced 50%, the coefficient ofmoist clay being 0.50.The loss of head due to a core wall of masonry, as designed for theNew Croton Dam, was assumed by the board of experts to be 21 ft., or17% of the depth of water in full reservoir. It has been stated byseveral authorities that the primary object of a masonry core wall isto afford a water-tight cut-off to any water of percolation which mayreach it through the upper half of the embankment. It appears thatabsolute water-tightness in the core wall is not obtained, although thecore walls of the Croton dams are said to be the very best quality ofrubble masonry that can be made.Mr. W. W. Follett, who is reported to have had considerable experiencein building earth dams, and who has made some valuable suggestionsthereupon, is emphatic in saying,    that the junction of earth and masonry forms a weak point, that    either a puddle or masonry core in an earthen dam is an element    of weakness rather than strength.He also thinks the usual manner of segregating and depositingmaterials different in density and weight, and thus subject todifferent amounts of settlement, as bad a form of construction as couldbe devised.Core walls may prevent free passage of water and excessive seepage,but are nevertheless of doubtful expediency.Earthwork Slips and Drainage.Mr. John Newman, in his admirable treatise on Earthwork Slips andSubsidences upon Public Works, classifies and enumerates slips asfollows:    Natural causes, 7.    Artificial causes, 31.    Additional causes due to impounded water, 7.After describing each cause he presents 39 different means used toprevent such slips and describes methods of making repairs.Mr. Wm. L. Strange has had such a large and valuable experience and hasset forth so carefully and lucidly both the principles and practice ofearth dam construction, that the writer takes pleasure in again quotinghim on the subject of _drainage_, of which he is an ardent advocate. Hesays that,    thorough drainage of the base of a dam is a matter of vital    necessity, for notwithstanding all precautions, some water will    certainly pass through the puddle.It is at the junction of the dam with the ground that the maximumamount of leakage may be expected. The percolating water should begotten out as quickly as possible. The whole method of dealing withslips may be summed up in one word_drainage_.The proper presentation of these two phases of our subject would initself require a volume. The interested reader is therefore referred tothe different authorities and writers cited in Appendix II.Jerome Park Reservoir Embankments.The Jerome Park reservoir is an artificial basin involving theexcavation and removal of large quantities of soil, and the erection oflong embankments with masonry core walls, partly founded on rock andpartly on sand. The plan and specifications call for an embankment 20ft. wide on top, with both slopes 2 on 1, and provide for lining theinner slope with brick or stone laid in concrete, and for covering thebottom with concrete laid on good earth compacted by rolling.[Illustration: Section at Sta. 99.][Illustration: Section at Sta. 76+20.FIG. 20.GRAPHICAL EXHIBIT OF STUDIES OF JEROME PARK RESERVOIREMBANKMENT.]Wherever bed rock was not considered too deep below the surface thecore walls were built upon it. In other places the foundation wasplaced 8 to 10 ft. below the bottom of the reservoir and rested uponthe sand.It appears that the plans of the Jerome Park embankment were changedfrom their original design, prior to the report of the board ofexperts, on account of two alleged defects, namely, cracks in the corewall and foundation of quicksand, and incidentally on account of thesupposed instability of the inner bank.In describing the materials on which these embankments rest the expertsremarked    that all these fine sands are unstable when mechanically    agitated in an excess of water, and that they all settle in    a firm and compact mass under the water when the agitation    ceases. That they are quite unlike the true quicksands whose    particles are of impalpable fineness and which are quick    or unstable under water.Fig. 20 is a graphic exhibit of the results of tests made at Station76 + 20, and at Station 99, to determine the flow line of water inthe sand strata underlying the embankment and bottom of the Jerome Parkreservoir.The experts reported that there was no possible danger of sliding orsloughing of the bank; that the utmost that could be expected wouldbe the percolation of a small amount of water through the embankmentand the earth; and that this would be carried off by the sewers in theadjacent avenues; that a large expenditure to prevent such seepagewould not be warranted nor advisable.In concluding their report, however, they recommended changing theinner slope of 2 on 1 to 2 on 1, and doubling the thickness of theconcrete lining at the foot of the slope to preclude all possibilityof the sliding or the slipping of the inner bank in case of the waterbeing lowered rapidly in the reservoir.Mr. W. R. Hill, then chief engineer of the Croton Aqueduct Commission,favored extending the core walls to solid rock. He took exception tothe manner of obtaining samples of sand by means of pipe and force-jetof water, claiming that only the coarsest sand was obtained forexamination. He did not consider fine sand through which three mencould run a -in. rod 19 and 20 ft. to rock without use of a hammer,very stable material upon which to build a wall.North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Boston.The North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir is another large public workin progress at the present time. It is of somewhat unusual designand the preliminary investigations and experiments which led to itsadoption are interesting in the extreme.[3]The area to be explored in determining the best location for the dikewas great, and the preliminary investigations conducted by means ofwash drill borings, very extensive. A total of 1,131 borings were madeto an average depth of 83 ft., the maximum depth being 286 ft. Thematerials were classified largely by the appearance of the samples,though chemical and filtration tests were also made. The plane of theground water was from 35 to 50 ft. below the surface, and the action ofthe water-jet indicated in a measure the degree of permeability of thestrata.In addition to these tests experimental dikes of different materials,and deposited in different ways, were made in a wooden tank 6 ft. wide,8 ft. high and 60 ft. long. The stability of soils when in contact withwater was experimented with, as shown in Fig. 21, in the followingmanner:An embankment (Fig. 21) was constructed in the tank of the material tobe experimented with, 2 ft. wide on top, 6 ft. high, with slopes 2 on1, and water admitted on both sides to a depth of 5 ft. The top wascovered with 4-in. planks 2 ft. long and pressure applied by means oftwo jack screws resting upon a cross beam on top of the planks.With a pressure of three tons per square foot, the 4-in. planks wereforced down into the embankment a little more than 6 ins., resultingin a very slight bulging of the slopes a little below the water level.Immediately under the planks the soil became hard and compact. A mansweight pushed a sharp steel rod, -in. in diameter, only 6 to 8 ins.into the embankment where the pressure was applied, while outside ofthis area the rod was easily pushed to the bottom of the tank.These results corroborate in a general way the practical experience ofthe author, both in compressed embankments, where he found it necessaryto use a pick vigorously to loosen the material of which they werecomposed, and in embankments made by merely dumping the material froma track, in which case the earth is so slightly compressed that anexcavation is easily made with a shovel.[Illustration: Fig. 21.][Illustration: Fig. 22.][Illustration: Fig. 23.CAN FOR DETERMINING FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE][Illustration: Fig. 24.][Illustration: Fig. 25.FIGS. 21 TO 24.EXPERIMENTAL DIKES AND CYLINDER EMPLOYED IN STUDIES FORTHE NORTH DIKE OF THE WACHUSETT RESERVOIR; AND (FIG. 25) CROSS-SECTIONOF THE DIKE.]The difference in the coefficient of friction of the same materialwhen dry and when wet greatly modifies the form of slope. The harderand looser the particles, the _straighter_ will be the slope line inexcavation and slips. The greater the cohesion of the earth, the _morecurved_ will be the slope, assuming a parabolic curve near the topthetrue form of equilibrium.RATE OF FILTRATION.The rate of filtration through different soils wasexperimented with by forming a dike in the tank previously mentioned,as shown in Fig. 22.The dike was made full 8 ft. high, 7 ft. wide on top, with a slope onthe up-stream side of 2 on 1, and on the down-stream side 4 on 1. Thisgave a base width of 55 ft. Immediately over the top of the dike therewas placed 3 ft. of soil to slightly consolidate the top of the bankand permit the filling of the tank to the top without overflowing thedike. The water pressure in different parts of the dike was determinedby placing horizontal pipes through the soil crosswise of the tank.These pipes were perforated and covered with wire gauze, beingconnected to vertical glass tubes at their ends. The end of the slopeon the down-stream side terminated in a box having perforated sides andfilled with gravel, thus enabling the water to percolate and filter outof the bank without carrying the soil with it.When the soil was shoveled loosely into the tank, without consolidationof any kind, it settled on becoming saturated and became quite compact.It took five days for the water to appear in the sixth gauge pipe nearthe lower end of the tank. After the pressure, which was maintainedconstant, had been on for several weeks, the seepage amounted to onegallon in 22 minutes. When the soil was deposited by shoveling into thewater, the seepage amounted to one gallon in 34 minutes.The relative filtering capacities of soils and sands were thought tobe better determined by the use of galvanized iron cylinders of knownareas.Fig. 23 shows one of the cylinders. These latter experiments confirmedthose previously made at Lawrence, by Mr. Allen Hazen, for theMassachusetts State Board of Health. They showed that the loss of headwas directly proportioned to the quantity of water filtered and thatthe quantity filtered will vary as the square of the diameter of the_effective size_ of the grains of the filtering material.[4]The material classed as permeable at the North Dike of the WachusettReservoir has an effective diameter of about 0.20 mm. A few results aregiven in the following table:Amount of Filtration in Gallons per Day, Through an Area of 10,000 Sq.Ft., With a Loss of Head or Slope of 1 ft. in 10 ft.

The soil was rammed in 3-in. layers, and special care takento prevent water from following along the sides and bottom of the tank.One end was filled with water to near the top, while the other end gavea free outlet.After this experiment had been continued for more than a month, theamount of seepage averaged 1.7 gallons per 24 hours, or about 32 dropsper minute.Filtration tests were also made through soil under 150 ft. head, or 5lbs. per sq. in., with results not materially different, it is stated,from those already given. The soil used in all these tests containedfrom 4 to 8% by weight of organic matter. This was burned and similartests made with the incinerated soil, resulting in an increase of about20% more seepage water.PERMANENCE OF SOILS.This last material experimented with suggests thesubject of _permanence_ of soils. This was reported upon separately andindependently by Mr. Allen Hazen and Prof. W. O. Crosby. These expertsagreed in their conclusion, stating    that the process of oxidation below the line of saturation would be    extremely slow, requiring many thousands of years for the complete    removal of all the organic matter, and that the tightness of the    bank would not be materially affected by any changes which are    likely to occur.It has been remarked,    that of all the materials used in the construction of    dams, _earth_ is physically the least destructible of    any. The other materials are all subject to more or less    disintegration, or change in one form or another, and in    earth they reach their ultimate and most lasting form.In speaking of the North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir, Mr. Stearnsremarked that,    it was evident by the application of Mr. Hazens formula for    the flow of water through sands and gravels, that the very    fine sands found at a considerable depth below the surface    would not permit enough water to pass through them if a dike    of great width were constructed, to cause a serious loss of    water, and it was also found that the soil, which contained    not only the fine particles or organic matter, but also a    very considerable amount of fine comminuted particles, which    the geologist has termed rock flour, would be sufficiently    impermeable to be used as a substitute for clay puddle.Fig. 25 shows the maximum section of the North Dike with its cut-offtrench.

K. Martin.Construction was begun in 1864, and the dam was finished in 1870. Mr.Alfred M. Quick, present chief engineer of the water-works of theCity of Baltimore has given a very lucid description of this work inEngineering News of Feb. 20, 1902.Fig. 26 is a cross-section of this dam, showing the method ofconstruction so clearly as to scarcely need further description. Thebanks D-D on either side of the central puddle wall were carried up in6-in. layers with horses and carts, and kept about 2 ft. higher thanthe puddle trench, which always contained water. The banks E-E weremade of dumped material, after which the basins F-F were first filledwith water and finally filled by dumping material into the water fromtracks being moved in toward the center.[Illustration: FIG. 26WORKING CROSS-SECTION OF DRUID LAKE DAM.]After reaching the top of this fill, banks B-B-B were built up inlayers similar to D-D. The second set of basins C-C were then filledin a manner similar to F-F. The remaining portion A-A was constructedin layers like D-D and B-B, with the addition of compacting each layerwith a heavy roller.Finally the inner face slope was carried up in 3-in. layers andthoroughly rolled, after which 2 ft. of good puddle was put upon theinner slope the latter was rip-rapped, the crown covered with graveland the rear slope sodded.Some years after completion, a driveway was built along the outerslope, as shown, which had a tendency to strengthen the dam, though notdesigned expressly for that purpose.It is of interest to know that the influent, effluent and drain pipeswere originally constructed through or under the embankment. Thesepipes were laid upon solid earth, and where they passed through thepuddle wall were supported upon stone piers 6 ft. apart. As might beexpected, they soon cracked badly and were finally abandoned, new onesbeing placed in the original ground at the south side of the lake. Mr.Quick states that so far as is known there has never been any evidenceof a leak through the embankment during these 32 years of service.New Types of Dams; Bohio, Panama Canal.A brief description will now be given of three different dams designedfor Bohio, on the proposed Panama Canal. Mr. George S. Morisons paperbefore the American Society of Civil Engineers, on The Bohio Dam,and the discussion thereon, especially that by Mr. F. P. Stearns, werequite fully reported in Engineering News for March 13 and May 8, 1902.In constructing the Panama Canal it will be necessary to impound thewaters of the Chagres River, near Bohio, to maintain the summit levelof this canal and supply water for lockage.THE FRENCH DESIGN.Fig. 27 is an enlarged section of the originaldesign of the new French Co. This design has no core wall, but atthe up-stream toe a concrete wall was to be built across the riverbetween the two lines of sheet-piling. At the down-stream toe a largeamount of riprap was to be placed to prevent destruction of the damduring construction. In this case it would be necessary to constructa temporary dam above and also to use the excavation for the locksas a flood spillway. This method would involve considerable risk tothe work, on account of the large volume of flood waters it might benecessary to take care of during construction.ISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION.The dam proposed by the Isthmian CanalCommission is shown by Fig. 28. This was designed to be an absolutelywater-tight closure of the geological valley, by using a masonry corewall carried down to bed rock. The maximum depth being 129 ft., it wasplanned to rest the concrete wall on a series of pneumatic caissonsreaching to rock. The spaces between the caissons would be closed andmade water-tight. Both slopes of the earth embankment were to havehorizontal benches and be revetted with loose rock.MR. MORISONS DESIGN.To appreciate fully the object and aim of thethird design, Fig. 29, which may be called a new type, although similarin many respects to the North Dike of the Wachusett reservoir alreadyillustrated and described, it should be stated that the equalized flowof the Chagres River is put at 1,000 cu. ft. per sec. Of this quantityit is estimated that 500 cu. ft. would be needed for lockage and 200cu. ft. for evaporation. This leaves 300 cu. ft. per sec. available forseepage and other losses or to be wasted.[Illustration][Illustration][Illustration: FIGS. 27 TO 29.DESIGNS FOR THE BOHIO DAM, PANAMACANAL.]It will thus be seen that a scarcity of water is not in this instancea condition demanding an absolutely water-tight dam. The amount ofseepage permissible without endangering the stability of the structureis the real point now to be discussed.The third design, which was proposed by Mr. Morison, is shown by Fig.29. The topography and configuration of this dam site is not unlikethat of the San Leandro Dam, California, soon to be described, whilethe general design is similar, as has been remarked, to the North Dikeof the Wachusett Reservoir.This third design contemplates a compound structure, formed by tworock-fill dams situated about 2,120 ft. apart, with the interveningspace filled with loose rock, earth and other available material.Immediately below the upper and higher rock-fill dam, it is proposedto place across the canyon a puddle wall 50 ft. in width, resting overtwo lines of sheet-piling 30 ft. apart. This piling would probably notreach farther than 50 ft. below tidewater, the solid rock floor beingabout 100 ft. deeper.Mr. Morison made use of Mr. Hazens filtration formula for estimatingthe rate and quantity of seepage through the permeable strata below thedam. This formula is:             h t + 10    V = cd               l   60    where    V = rate of flow in meters per day through the whole section.    c = constant varying from 450 to 1,200,        according to cleanness of the sand.    d = effective size of sand in mm.    h = head in feet.    l = length or distance water must pass.    t = temperature of the water (Fahr.)This formula should be used only when the _effective sizes_ of sandsare from 0.10 to 3.0 mm. and with _uniformity coefficients_ below5.0[5].Mr. Morison used the following values: c = 1,000; d = 1.0 mm.; h = 90ft.; l = 2,500 ft.; t = 90; for the solution of this problem, andobtained a velocity of 0.002 ft. per sec. The bed of sand and gravelwas assumed to have a sectional area of 20,000 sq. ft. for 2,500 ft. inlength. This gives a seepage of 40 cu. ft. per sec.It is believed that the above rate of 0.002 ft. per sec., equivalent to1 ins. per minute, or 7 ft. per hour, is not sufficient to move any ofthe material. The velocity of water percolating through sand is foundto vary directly as the head and inversely as the distance.The value of c in the formula is larger for sands of filtersfavorable for flow, and smaller for compacted materials and dams.Mr. Morison thought it might be nearer the actual conditions to assumed = 0.50 mm.; c = 500; and l = 5,000 ft.; in which case the seepagewould only amount to 2.5 ft. per sec. In this last assumption theeffective size of sand grains is 2 times that classed as permeablematerial at the North Dike of the Wachusett Reservoir.Prof. Philipp Forchheimer, of Gratz, Austria, recommends the use of theformula,     h     = a + b     lfor the percolation through soils between loam and loamy sand.Sellheim, Masoni, Smreker, Krber and other authorities on filtrationuse still other formulas, to which the reader and student is referredfor further research.The writer, having had occasion in his professional practice to studyquite carefully the subject of ground waters, and their percolationor flow through different classes of materials and under varyingconditions, is of the opinion that rarely does the cross-section ofa stream-channel, filled with sand, gravel and debris, present, evenapproximately, a homogeneous or uniform mass; and that there are,almost without exception, strata of material much coarser and moreporous than the general average. In other words, that it is extremelydifficult to arrive at a uniformity coefficient. It is unwise to placemuch reliance upon an estimated flow where this is the case. Theformula may be used with confidence where the layers are artificiallymade, and where there is no uncertainty regarding the uniform characterof the material. In most natural channels there are distinct linesof flow, and under considerable hydrostatic head or pressure theselines of flow would surely enlarge. There is a wide difference betweenpermissible and dangerously excessive percolation through an earthembankment. The local features, economical considerations and magnitudeof the risks, all bear upon this question and must be considered foreach particular case.It is of interest to compare the estimated cost of the three designsproposed for the Bohio Dam, based upon the same unit prices, as follows:    French Engineers design              $3,500,000    Isthmian Canal Commissioners design   8,000,000    Mr. Morisons design                   2,500,000No comments will be made upon these figures, further than to remarkthat the successful building of a stable dam, accomplished by the useof an excessive quantity of materials and at a cost beyond reasonablerequirements, is mainly instructive as illustrating how not to do it.It is creditable to execute substantial works at a reasonable cost,but it reflects no credit upon any one to construct them regardless ofexpense.Combined Rock-fill and Earth Dam.Fig. 30 shows a section of the Upper Pecos River Dam near Eddy, N. M.This dam is quite fully described by Mr. Jas. D. Schuyler, in hisrecent book on Reservoirs for Irrigation, Water-Power and DomesticWater-Supply, and need not be mentioned in this paper, further thanto call attention to the combination of rock-fill and earth whichconstitutes its particular type of construction. This type of dam isbelieved to be for many localities a very good one, but up to thepresent time has only been adopted for dams of moderate height, under60 ft.The San Leandro Dam, California.A section of the San Leandro Dam, near Oakland, Cal., is shown byFig. 31. This section was supplied by Mr. W. F. Boardman, hydraulicengineer, who superintended the construction of the dam, from his ownprivate notes and data. It differs materially from sections heretoforepublished, and is 5 ft. higher, thus making it rank as the highestearth dam in the world of which we have an authentic record.The dam was commenced in 1874, and brought up to a height of 115 ft.above the bed of the creek in 1898. At the present time it is 500 ft.in length on the crest and 28 ft. wide. The original width of theravine at the base of the dam was 66 ft. The present width of basefrom toe to toe of slopes is 1,700 ft. The height of embankment abovethe original surface is 125 ft., with a puddle trench extending 30 ft.below.[Illustration: FIG. 30.CROSS-SECTION OF UPPER PECOS RIVER DAM;COMBINED ROCK FILL AND EARTH.][Illustration: FIG. 31.DEVELOPED SECTION OF SAN LEANDRO DAM.]All that portion of the dam within a slope of 2 on 1 at the rear and3 on 1 at the face is built of choice material, carefully selected andput in with great care. The portion outside of the 2 on 1 slope lineat the down-stream side of the dam, was _sluice in_ from the adjacenthills regardless of its character, and is composed of ordinary soilcontaining more or less rock.This process of sluicing was carried on during the rainy season, whenthere was an abundance of water, and it was intended to be continueduntil the canyon below the dam had been filled to an average slope of6.7 on 1 at the rear of the dam. It was thought that the location wasparticularly favorable for this kind of construction, the originalintention being to raise the dam from time to time, not only toincrease the storage as the demand for water increased, but to meetthe annual loss in capacity caused by the silting up of the reservoirbasin. The latter has amounted to about 1 ft. in depth per annum.METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION.Under the main body of the dam, the surface wasstripped of all sediment, sand, gravel and vegetable matter. Choicematerial, carefully selected, was then brought by carts and wagons andevenly distributed over the surface in layers about 1 ft. or less inthickness. This was sprinkled with just enough water to make it packwell, not enough to make it like mud. During construction a band ofhorses was led by a boy on horseback over the entire work, to compactthe materials and assist in making the dam one homogeneous mass. Norollers were used on this dam.The central trench was cut 30 ft. below the original bed of the creek.In the bottom of this trench three secondary trenches, 3 ft. wide by 3ft. deep, were made and filled with concrete. These concrete walls werecarried up 2 ft. above the general floor of the trench, to break thecontinuity of its surface.The original wasteway, constructed at the north end of the dam, hasbeen practically abandoned, having been substituted by a tunnel oflarger capacity. The original wasteway was excavated in the bed rockof the natural hillside, and although lined with masonry, is not inthe best condition. The author considers its location an objectionablefeature, as menacing the safety of the dam, and thinks it should bepermanently closed.A wasteway tunnel, 1,487 ft. in length, was constructed in 1888,through a ridge extending north of the dam. This has a sectional areaof about 1010 ft., lined with brick masonry throughout, having a gradeof 2%.The criticism might be made of the tunnel that it is faulty in designat the entry or reservoir end, where the water must first fall overa high spillway wall, aerating the water before entering the tunnelproper. The water even then has not easy access to the tunnel, and noadequate arrangements have been made for ventilation, so as to insurethe utilization of its maximum capacity. The maximum depth of water inthe reservoir is about 85 ft., and the full capacity 689,000,000 cu.ft. of water. The catchment area is 43 square miles, and the surfaceof the reservoir when full 436 acres. The outlet pipes are placed intwo tunnels at different elevations through the ridge north of the dam.There are no culverts or pipes extending through the body of the damitself.Hydraulic-fill Dams.No discussion of earth dams would be complete without some referencebeing made to the novel type of construction developed in westernAmerica in recent years, by which railroad embankments and water-tightdams are built up by the sole agency of water. The water for thispurpose is usually delivered under high pressure, as it is generallyconvenient to make it first perform the work of loosening the earthand rock in the borrow pit, as well as subsequently to transport themto the embankment, and there to sort and deposit them and finally partcompany with them after compacting them solidly in place, even morefirmly than if compressed by heavy rollers. Sometimes, however, wateris delivered to the borrow pit without pressure, in which event thematerials must be loosened by the plow or by pick and shovel by theprocess called ground sluicing in placer mining parlance.An abundance of water delivered by gravity under high pressure isusually regarded as one of the essential factors in hydraulic-fill dambuilding, but it is not essential that there be a large continuousflow. The Lake Frances Dam, recently constructed for the Bay CountiesCo., of California, by J. D. Schuyler, is 75 ft. high, 1,340 ft. longon top, and contains 280,000 cu. yds. The dam was built up by materialssluiced by water that was forced by a centrifugal pump through a 12-in.pipe and 3-in. nozzle, against a high bank, whence the materials weretorn and conveyed by the water through flumes and pipes to the dam.About 6 cu. ft. per sec. of water was thus used, and at one stage ofthe work the supply stream was reduced to less than 0.1 ft. per sec.,the water being gathered in a pond and pumped over and over again.The chapter on hydraulic-fill dams in Mr. Schuylers book onReservoirs for Irrigation will be found to contain matter on thesubject interesting to those who desire to pursue it further, and thereader is again referred to that work.An Impervious Diaphragm in Earth Dams.As a result of the recent extended discussion concerning the designof the New Croton Dam and the Jerome Park Reservoir embankments,the Engineering News of Feb. 20, 1902, contained a very suggestiveeditorial entitled, Concerning the Design of Earth Dams and ReservoirEmbankments. The opinion is given that no type of structure that manbuilds to confine water can compare in permanence with earth dams,after which the following pertinent questions are asked:    1. How shall an earth dam be made water-tight?    2. What is the office and purpose of the masonry core wall?    3. Would not a water-proof diaphragm of some kind be better       than a core wall of either masonry or puddle?The article then suggests a number of designs of diaphragm construction,with a special view of obtaining absolute water-tightness, by use ofasphaltum, cement mortar, steel plates, etc. Special emphasis was putupon the _principle_ of constructing a water-proof diaphragm. Thematter of relative cost is advanced as an argument in favor of thediaphragm principle as against the usual orthodox method. The saving incost is to be accomplished by the use of inferior materials and lesscare in the handling of them, or by both. It is suggested that almostany kind of material available, rock, sand or gravel, will answerevery purpose where good earth is not to be found. Further, that thismaterial may be dumped from the carts, cars or cableways, or be placedby the hydraulic-fill method.The writer believes the diaphragm method of construction may have somemerits, but that it is attended by the very great risk of neglectingprinciples most vitally important to the successful construction ofhigh earth dams, which will now be formulated and advanced, as follows:CHAPTER VI._Conclusions._The writer in concluding this study wishes to emphasize certainprinciples and apparently minor details of construction, which fromobservation and personal experience, seem to him of vital importance.He believes firmly in the truth contained in the following remarks byMr. Desmond FitzGerald, of Boston, germane to this subject:    An engineer must be guided by local conditions and the resources at    his command in building reservoir embankments. His design must be    largely affected by the nature of the materials. There are certain    _general principles_, however, which must be observed and which    will be applied by an engineer of skill, judgment and experience to    whatever design he may adopt. It is in the application of these    principles that the services of the professional man becomes    valuable, and it is from a lack of them, that there have been so    many failures.The details and principles of construction, relating to high earthdams, may be summarized or stated in order of their application, asfollows:(1) Select a firm, dry, impermeable foundation, or make it so byexcavation and drainage. All alluvial soil containing organic matterand all porous materials should be excavated and removed from thedam site when practicable; that is, where the depth to a suitableimpermeable foundation is not prohibitive by reason of excessive cost.Wherever springs of water appear, they must be carried outside thelines of the embankment by means of bed rock drains, or a system ofpipes so laid and embedded as to be permanent and effective.The drainage system must be so designed as to prevent the infiltrationof water upward and into the lower half of the embankment, and at thesame time insure free and speedy outlet for any seepage water passingthe upper half. All drains should be placed upon bed rock or in thenatural formation selected for the foundation of the superstructure.They should be constructed in such a manner as to prevent the flowof water outside the channel provided for it, and also prevent anyenlargement of the channel itself. To this end, cement, mortar, brokenstone, and good gravel puddle are the materials best suited for thispurpose.(2) Unite the body of the embankment to the natural foundation by meansof an impervious material, durable and yet sufficiently elastic to bondthe two together. When the depth to a suitable foundation is great,a central trench excavated with sloping sides, extending to bed rockor other impervious formation, refilled with good puddling material,properly compacted, will suffice.When clayey earth is scarce and expensive to obtain, a small amount ofclay puddle confined between walls of brick, stone or concrete masonry,and extending well into the body of the embankment and so built asto avoid settlement, will prevent excessive seepage. This form ofconstruction is not to be carried much above the original surface ofthe ground.(3) The continuity of surfaces should always be broken, at the sametime avoiding the formation of cavities and lines of cleavage. Noexcavation to be refilled should have vertical sides, and longcontinuous horizontal planes should be intercepted by wedge-shapedoffsets, enabling the dovetailing of materials together.All loose and seamy rock or other porous material should be removed,and where the refill is not the best for the purpose, mix the good andbad ingredients thoroughly, after which deposit in very thin layers.(4) Make the dimensions and profile of dam with a factor of safetyagainst sliding of not less than ten. The preliminary calculations fordesigning such a profile have been given on p. 42.(5) Aim at as nearly a homogeneous mass in the body of the embankmentas possible, thus avoiding unequal settlement and deformation. Thismanner of manipulating materials will eliminate many uncertain orunknown factors, but it means rigid inspection of the work andintelligent segregation of materials, no matter what method oftransporting them may be adopted. The smaller the unit loads maybe, the more easily a homogeneous distribution of materials will beobtained.(6) Select earthy materials in preference to organic soils, with aview of such combination or proportion of different materials as willreadily consolidate. _Consolidation is the most important processconnected with the building of an earth dam._ The judicious use ofsoil containing a small percentage of organic matter may be permitted,however, when there is a lack of clayey material for mixing with sandyand porous earth materials. Such a mixture, properly distributed andwetted, will consolidate well under heavy pressure and prove quitesatisfactory.(7) Consolidation being the most important process and the onlysafeguard against permeability and instability of form, use only theamount of water necessary to attain this. Too much or too little areequally bad and to be avoided. It is believed that only by experimentand experience is it possible to determine just the proper quantity ofwater to use with the different classes of materials and their varyingconditions. In rolling and consolidating the bank, all portions thathave a tendency to quake must be removed at once and replaced withmaterial that will consolidate; it _must not_ be covered up, no matterhow small the area.(8) In an artificial embankment for impounding water it isimpracticable to place reliance upon time for consolidation; it _must_be effected by mechanical means. Again we repeat, that consolidation isthe most vitally important operation connected with the building of anearth dam. When this is satisfactorily attained it is proof that thematerials are suitable and that the other necessary details have beenin a large measure complied with. Light rollers are worse than useless,being a positive harm, resulting in a smoothing or ironing process,deceptive in appearance and detrimental in many ways.The matter of supreme importance in the construction of earth dams isthat the greatest consolidation possible be specified and effected.To this end it is necessary that heavy rollers be employed, and thatsuch materials be selected as respond best to the treatment. Thereare certain kinds of earth materials which no amount of wetting androlling will compact. These must be rejected as unfit for use in anyportion of an earth dam. Let the design of the structure be ever sotrue to correct engineering principles, it is still necessary to giveuntiring attention to the work of consolidation. It is thereforeaccording to the design of a thoroughly compacted homogeneous mass,rather than to the suggested _diaphragm type_, to which modern practiceshould conform. This is in harmony with Natures own methods, and inconformity to correct principles.(9) Avoid placing pipes or culverts through any portion of theembankment. The writer considers it bad practice ever to place theoutlet pipes through a high earth dam, and fails to see any necessityfor so doing.(10) The surface of the dam, both front and rear, must be suitablyprotected against the deteriorating effects of the elements. This mayinclude pitching the up-stream face, the riprap work at the toe of theinner slope, the roadway and covering of the crown, the sodding orother protection of the rear slope, and the construction of surfacedrains for the berms.(11) Ample provision for automatic wasteways should be made forevery dam, so that the embankment can never under any circumstancesbe over-topped by the impounded water. Earthquakes and seismicdisturbances will produce no disastrous effects upon an earth dam.Its elasticity will resist the shock of water lashing backwards andforwards in the reservoir.(12) Finally, provide for intelligent and honest supervision duringconstruction, and insist upon proper care and maintenance everafterwards.APPENDIX I.High Earth Dams.

P. Stearns,Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, in theProceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers for April, 1902.The latter description was reprinted, with the omission of some of theillustrations, in Engineering News for May 8, 1902.[4] By effective size of sand grains is meant such size of grain that10% by weight of the particles are smaller, and 90% larger than itself;or, to express it a little differently, the effective size is equalto a sphere the volume of which is greater than / that forming theweight and is less than / that forming the weight.[5] The term uniformity coefficient is used to designate the ratioof the size of the grain which has 60% of the sample finer than itselfto the size which has 10% finer than itself. The method of determiningthe size of sand grains and their uniformity coefficients, is fullyexplained in Appendix 3 of Mr. Hazens book on The Filtration ofPublic Water Supplies.
