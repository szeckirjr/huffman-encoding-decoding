Le philosophe, en tudiant les lois de la Nature, acquiert chaque  jour la conviction que de leur violation seule naissent tous les maux  dont gmit lhumanit.  The philosopher, in studying the laws of Nature, acquires more deeply  every day the conviction that from their abuse alone spring all the  evils from which humanity is groaning.                                        DR. MENVILLE DE PONSAN                                (Histoire de la Femme; Vol. III., p. 3).                              WOMAN FREE.                                   I.    Source of the Light that cheers this later day,    Science calm moves to spread her sovereign sway;    Research and Reason, ranged on either hand,    Proclaim her message to each waiting land;    In truths whose import stands but part revealed,    Till man befit himself those truths to wield;    Since to high Knowledge duties high belong,  As to the poets power the task of worthy song.                                  II.    And man, from every stage of slow degree,    Amendment for his previous rule may see;    His keener conscience in our fuller time    Perceives the whilom careless act a crime,    Or finds some fancied fault to progress tend,    By wiser vision traced to truer end;    Till, growing shrewder in the growing light,  We know no lack of good but our own lack of sight.                                  III.    Thus, sad at first, we mark each evil deed,    Of ignorance or will, bear fatal seed    Of suffering to others in its train,    The guileless share its penalty of pain,    And mans worst misery ofttimes is brought    By trespass he himself nor did nor thought;    Austere the fiat, yet therefrom we learn  A purer life to frame, lest myriads mourn in turn.                                  IV.    Deep though the teaching that this truth reveals    Of fellowship of man with all that feels,    Remains the riddle that, though inmost ken    Of humblest creatures and of rudest men    Has sense of freedom as an instinct strong,    Resenting injury as act of wrong,    Man listed not this monitors still voice,  But gave his wanton wish the guilty force of choice.                                   V.    Dark looms the record of his earlier years,    A troubled tale of infamy and tears;    For, of the ill by man primeval wrought,    Shows forth predominant with anguish fraught,    And long disaster to the ensuant race,    The direful course of degradation base,    Where freedom, justice, right,at one fell blow,  In womans life of slave were outraged and laid low.                                  VI.    The inklings gleaned of prehistoric hour    Speak woman thrall to mans unbridled power;    Than brute more gifted, he, with heinous skill,    Subdued her being to his sensual will;    Binding her fast with ties of cunning weight,    By mothers burden forced to slavish fate;    Thus woman was, and such her man-made doom,  Ere yet the dawn of love illumed the soulless gloom.                                  VII.    Ere Evolution, in unhasting speed,    Trained mans regard to larger life and need;    By Art his feelings waked to functions higher,    Disclosed within his clay the veins of fire,    Taught him his pleasures of the flesh to find    But presage of the mightier joys of mind;    Evoked the soul from fume of mortal dust,  The vestal flame of love from lower flush of lust.                                 VIII.    The eye that once could note but food or foe    Grew wise to watch the landscapes varied glow;    To gaze beyond our earthly temporal bars,    And track the orbit of the wandering stars:    The voice erst roused by hunger or by rage    Now tells the nobler passions of the age,    Till with loves language is uplifted love  To high and selfless thought all sensuous aim above.                                  IX.    But not at once such life and love to know,    For progress strives through many an ebb and flow;    Mans kindling sense, though stirred by call of Art,    Still missed the motive of her deepest heart;    Twas in her gracious embassy to give    A fairer faith and fate to all that live,    Neglecting none,yet man, twixt lust and pride,  Due portion in the boon to woman still denied.                                   X.    ons of wrong ere history was born,    With added ages passed in slight and scorn,    Maintained the chains of primal womanhood,    And clogged in turn mans power of greater good;    Egypt or Greece in vain sought heavenly light    While womans soul was held from equal flight,    Her path confined by man to sordid end,  As subjugated wife, or hireling transient friend.                                  XI.    Marriagewhich might have been a mateship sweet,    Where equal souls in hallowed converse meet,    Each aiding each the higher truths to find,    And raising body to the plane of mind,    Mans baser will restrained to lower grade,    And womans share a brainless bondage made;    Her only hope of thought or learning wide,  Some freer lot to seek than yoke forlorn of bride.                                  XII.    Yet, as hetaira,comrade, chambermate,    (The ambiguous word bespoke her dubious state),    She, craving mental food, might but be guest    By paying with her body for the quest;    Conceding that, might lead a learned life,    A licence vetoed to the legal wife,    Might win great wealth, or build a lasting fame,  Not due to her the guilt that left the tinge of shame.                                 XIII.    What guilt was there, apportion it aright    To him who fixed the gages of the fight;    Blame man, who, reckless of the womans fate,    In greed for meaner pleasure lost the great;    Blame him, the vaunted sage, who knew her mind    Peer to his own in skill and wit refined,    Yet left the after-ages to bemoan  The waste of woman worth that dawned and die unknown.                                  XIV.    And deep the shame on mans insensate heart    For later woman doomed to hideous part;    Poor lostling, bowed with worse than brutal woes,    To her not even dealt the brutes repose;    Her sweetness sullied, and her frame disgraced,    Soul scarce might light her temple fair defaced,    Its chastest sanctities coerced to give  For painful bread to eat, for piteous chance to live.                                  XV.    While such her fate in lands of cultured creed,    Judge womans griefs with man of barbarous breed;    Slave to his lust, and tiller of his soil,    Crippled and crushed by cruelty and toil;    Yet still her heart a gentle mien essayed,    By deeper passion, holier impulse, swayed;    Care for her wretched offspring rarely swerved,  And mother-love alone the infant oft preserved.                                  XVI.    Thus womans life, in low or high estate,    Man fettered with a more than natural weight    Of sexual function,disproportioned theme    And single basis in his female scheme;    He strove to quench her flash of quicker fire,    That crossed his lordship or his low desire;    Her one permitted end to serve his race,  Her individual soul forbidden breathing place.                                 XVII.    Scarce other seemed that soul than sentient tomb    Of human energy debarred to bloom;    Her spirit, pining in its durance drear,    Leaves legacy of many a burning tear    For aspirations crushed, and aims denied,    And instincts thwarted by mans purblind pride;    Her every wish made subject to the nod  Of him whose mad conceit proclaimed himself her God.                                 XVIII.    So stood at halt, through years of sterile change,    His narrowed brain and her restricted range;    And man intelligent and woman free,    Was union which the world had yet to see;    For time to come reserved the golden sight    Of glorious harvest from the natural right,    To her as amply as to him assigned  To compass power unknown in body and in mind.                                  XIX.    Happy the epoch destined to show    What force of good from that free fate shall flow;    The artificial limits to efface    Of laws and forms that womanhood debase;    Even our own imperfect hour may prove    The ecstasy of earnest souls that move    In dual union of unselfish strife  To reach by mutual love to true and equal life.                                  XX.    Yet slow, so slowly, gleams the gathering light,    And lingers still the hovering shade of night;    Though part undone the wrong that we confess,    Repentance cannot instant bring redress;    Nor woman, tortured by her thraldom long,    At once stand forth emancipate and strong;    Her pain persistent, though she calm suppress  Her rancour for the past, with sweet forgivingness.                                  XXI.    For carnal servitude left cruel stain,    And galls that fester from the fleshly chain;    Unhealed the scars of mans distempered greed,    The wounds of blind injustice still they bleed;    Recurrent suffering lets her not forget    The aimless payments of a dismal debt,    Survival from dim age of mans abuse  Of functions immature, profaned by savage use.                                 XXII.    Her girlhoods helpless years through cycles long    Had been a martyrdom of sexual wrong,    For little strength or choice might child oppose    To shield herself from force of sensual foes;    Impending motherhood might win no rest    Or refuge sacred from the satyr quest;    Unripe maternity, untimely birth,  The womans constant dole in those dark days of earth.                                 XXIII.    Action repeated tends to rhythmic course,    And thus the mischief, due at first to force,    Brought cumulative sequence to the race,    Till habit bred hereditary trace;    On woman falls that heritage of woe,    And een the virgin feels its dastard blow,    For, long ere fit to wield maternal cares,  Abnormal fruits of birth her guiltless body bears.                                 XXIV.    Misread by man, this sign of his misdeed    Was held as symptom of her nubile need,    And on through historys length her tender age    Has still been victim to his adult rage;    He, by his text, with irony serene,    Banned her resultant manner as unclean;    The censure base upon himself recoils,  Yet leaves the woman wan and cumbered in his toils.                                  XXV.    Vicarious punishment for manhoods crime    Takes grievous toll of all her active prime;    The hap, in educated womans fate,    Is instinct with antipathy and hate;    Reason confirming tells, no honest claim    Could ever cause such gust of inward shame,    Nor act of normal wont might man blaspheme  To make of Natures need a vile opprobrious theme.                                 XXVI.    Thoughts like to these are breathings of the truth    To whoso ponders deep the tale of ruth;    The futile mannish pleas that would explain    The purport of her periodic pain,    All bear unconscious witness to the wrong    In blindness born, in error fostered long,    The spurious function growing with the years,  Till almost natural use the morbid mode appears.                                 XXVII.    Grievous the hurt to woman, which to right    Is instant duty of our stronger sight;    From off her weary shoulders, bruised and worn,    To lift the cross in longtime misery borne;    Until, reintegrate in frame and mind,    A speedy restitution she shall find,    From every trammel of mans mastery freed,  Nor held by his behest from fullest life and deed.                                XXVIII.    And soon may pass her suffering, for the ill    By man begot lies subject to our skill;    All human malady may be allayed    With human forethought, human actions aid;    Ours then the fault, since, given in our hand    Is power the evil hazard to command;    For Nature, kindly wise our woes to shape,  In very pang of pain both prompts and points escape.                                 XXIX.    So woman shall her own redemption gain,    Instructed by the sting of bootless pain;    With Nature ever helpful to retrieve    The injury we heedlessly achieve,    From seed of act, by recent woman sown,    Already guerdon rich in hope is shown;    Such faculty her new-found presence decks,  The sage physician, she, and saviour of her sex.                                  XXX.    With purer phase of life proves woman less    The burden of the wasting weariness;    And thus, in rank refined or rude have grown    Maidens in whom the weakness was not known;    Hale woman and true mother have they been,    Yet never have the noisome habit seen:    Not to neglectful man to greatly care  How such immunity all womanhood might share.                                 XXXI.    Her intellect alert the harm shall heal,    And ways of wholesomeness and strength reveal;    The saving truth she wins with studious thought    More swiftly to her daughter shall be taught,    How body still is supple unto mind,    By dint of soul is fleshly form inclined,    And womans will shall work of man atone,  The deed his darkness wrought be by her light undone.                                 XXXII.    No longer drilled deformity to nurse,    And woo, when slow to appear, the absent curse,    Her counter-effort, helped by Natures grace,    Shall quell the customs last abhorrent trace;    Its morbid usurpation shall refute,    Not more to woman natural than to brute;    A needless noyance with a baseless claim,  The lingering mark of mans unthinking guilt and shame.                                XXXIII.    Her body, saved from enervating drain,    Shall lend a newer vigour to the brain;    Wide shall she roam in realms of untold thought,    Which ages since her shackled instinct sought;    For oft her prison had the yearnings heard,    In murmurings scarce rendered into word;    Promptings which man suspicious strove to choke,  Lest that her soul should rise and break his timeworn yoke.                                 XXXIV.    For autocrats of old, with treacherous guile,    Had bribed the villains soul by sensual wile;    To meanest man a lower drudge assigned,    With gift of female thrall cajoled the hind;    The stolid churl his servitude forgave    Whilst he in turn was master to a slave;    Through every rank the sexual serfdom ran,  And womans life was bound in vassalage to man.                                 XXXV.    Then, fearing that the slave herself might guess    The knavery of her forced enchainedness,    A subtle fiction mannish brain designed    To dominate her conscience and her mind,    Inhuman dogmas did his genius frame,    Investing them with sanctimonious name    Of womans duty; and the fetish base  Een to this reasoned day uplifts its impious face.                                 XXXVI.    By cant condoned, man fashioned womans sphere,    And mapped out natural bounds to her career;    His sapienceshould she dare any deed    In contravention of his codedecreed    On soul or body penalties condign,    In part dubbed civil law, and part divine:    Misguided man,confused in self-deceit  His unisexual wit and pious pretext meet.                                XXXVII.    Obeisance yet his caste of sex demands;    In legislative script the verbiage stands    How lowest boor is lordly baron styled,    And highest bride as common feme reviled;    The tardier fear that grants the clown a share    In his own governance, denies it her;    And British matrons are, by man-made rules,  In solemn statute ranked with infants, felons, fools.                                XXXVIII.    The crass injustice early man displayed,    His own crude infancy of brain betrayed;    His riper judgment scorns the childish use,    And cries to all his bygone freaks a truce;    Enactments that long blemished legal page    Shall fade as figments of a foolish age,    Till saner years have every bond erased  Which selfish law of man on life of woman placed.                                 XXXIX.    Till like with him in human right she stands,    Her will an equal power of rule commands;    Her voice, in council and in senate heard,    To stern debate brings harmonising word;    In mutual stress each sex the other cheers,    Since one are made their hopes and one their fears;    Self-reverent each, and reverencing each,  The theme that truer man and freer woman teach.                                  XL.    For but a slave himself must ever be,    Till she to shape her own career be free;    Free from all uninvited touch of man,    Free mistress of her persons sacred plan;    Free human soul; the brood that she shall bear,    The firstthe truly free, to breathe our air;    From woman slave can come but menial race,  The mother free confers her freedom and her grace.                                  XLI.    By her the progress of our future kind,    Their stalwart body and their spacious mind;    For, folded in her form each human mite    Has its first home, its sustenance and light;    Hers the live warmth that fans its spirit flame,    Her generous sap supplies its fleshly frame,    And een the juice,the fullborn infants food,  Is yet a blanched form of womans living blood.                                 XLII.    Strange wisdom by her unkenned craft is taught    While yet the embryo in her womb is wrought;    For, long ere entering on our tumult rife,    It learns from her the needful art of life;    Unconscious teacher, she, yet all she knows    Of dark experience to her infant flows,    And brands him, ere he rest upon her knee,  Offshoot of slavish race, not scion of the free.                                 XLIII.    To either sex the bondage and the pain,    They seek to live a freemans life in vain;    For man or woman can but act the part,    When tis not freeborn blood that fills the heart:    Strive as he may, the modern man, at best,    Is tyrant, differing somewhat from the rest;    Nor woman thraldom-bred can surely know  Where lies her richest gift, or how its wealth to show.                                 XLIV.    Thus learn we that in woman rendered free    Is raised the rank of all humanity;    The despot is the fullfruit of the slave;    To form the freeman, equable and brave,    Habit of freedom must spontaneous come    As life itself, and from the selfsame womb;    Life, liberty, and love,lien undefiled,  The freeborn mothers heirloom to her freeborn child.                                  XLV.    So shall her noble issue, maid or boy,    With equal freedom equal fate enjoy;    Together reared in purity and truth,    Through plastic childhood and retentive youth;    Their mutual sports of sinew and of brain    In strength alike the sturdy comrades train;    Of differing sex no thought inept intrudes,  Their purpose calmly sure all errant aim excludes.                                 XLVI.    For soul, not sex, shall to each life assign    What destiny to fill, or what decline;    Through years mature impartial range shall reach,    And wider wisdom, juster ethics, teach;    Conformed to claims of intellect and need,    The tempered numbers of their high-born breed;    Not overworn with childward pain and care,  The motherand the racerobuster health shall share.                                 XLVII.    Nor blankly epicene, as scoffers say,    The necessary sequence of that day;    For not by vapid imitation low,    Or aping falser sex shall truer grow;    Nor modish mind may fathom Natures range,    Or fix the fleeting scope of human change;    Can singer blind the rainbows tints compare?  The brain enslaved from birth the freemans powers declare?                                XLVIII.    Work we in faith, secure that precious seed    Shall bear due fruit for mans extremest need;    Not greatly timorous, as those fruits we see,    What changed existence from such food may be;    For well we wot shall come forth worthy soul,    Or male or female, with impartial dole    Of all that life can grant of good or great,  Happy what each may bring to help the common fate.                                 XLIX.    By mutual aid perfecting complex man,    Their twofold vision human life may scan    From differing standpoints, grasping from the two    A clearer concept and a bolder view;    And thus diverse humanity shall learn    A wisdom which not single sex might earn;    Each on the problem casting needful light,  Not fully known of one without the others sight.                                   L.    How should he write what she alone may tell?    The movements of her psychic ebb and swell;    The latent springs of life that in her gush,    When motherhoods first throb awakes her flush,    And swift the signal flashes to her soul,    Of future being claiming her control;    Seeking from her its mind and bodys food;  Drawing, to make its own, her evil and her good.                                  LI.    Within herself the dramas scene is laid,    The Birth and Growth of Soul the mystery played;    She, in her part, is but an agent mute,    Her brain untutored, nor her tact acute,    Her nerve-strung body slow as senseless soil    To watch the working of the seedlings toil;    In vain before her inmost vision spread  The hidden streams from whence the vital founts are fed.                                  LII.    The mothers blindness was blind mans decree,    And to himself reverts the misery;    Through hapless years his ordinance has run,    And harsh reward of ignorance has won;    His pride of maledom, dull to recognise    The deeper depth accessive to her eyes,    Forbade to teach her brain to understand  The facts that, deftly sought, lay ready to her hand.                                 LIII.    Less wisely he, his curious search to serve,    In helpless creature teased the quivering nerve,    And strove to probe the covert ways of life    By living butchery with learned knife,    And cruel anodyne that chained the will,    Yet left the shuddering victim conscious still:    But Nature shrinks from foul and fierce attack,  Nor yields her holiest truths on such a murderers rack.                                  LIV.    True science finds its own by kindlier quest,    Nor lowers itself to tortures loathsome test;    Multiplies not the sentient beings pain,    But makes a keener lens of mans own brain;    Seeks not by outrage dire a soul to grasp,    Or dimly trace its agonising gasp;    But surer learns what fire that soul may move,  Not wrung with deathly pang, but thrilled by breath of love.                                  LV.    To touch of love alone will Nature pour    The choicest treasures of her occult store;    Into the ear of love alone repeat    The secret of the song our pulses beat;    To eye of love alone, with joyance bright,    Shows she her form suffused in living light;    To heart that loves her, Nature gives to know  How from Loves might alone all thoughts of Wisdom grow.                                  LVI.    So opes a vaster knowledge to the view,    Love points the way and woman holds the clue;    Nature on her the trustful office laid,    And arbiter of human fortune made;    With woman honoured, rises man to height,    With her degraded, sinks again in night;    Yet still the wayward race has sluggish been  To learn the fealty due to Earths advancing queen.                                 LVII.    For long, in jealousy for corporal power,    Had man contemned his sisters worthier dower;    What time his ruder feelings held the sway,    With little hope or hint of truer way;    Till on a wistful world has dawned benign    The prescience of a potency divine    Sleeping, unrecked of, deep in womans heart,  Waiting some kiss superne, into full life to start.                                 LVIII.    Womans own soul must seek and find that fay,    And wake it into light of quickening day;    Mans counsel helpful in that track shall be    For all his learning rich return and fee;    His philosophic and chirurgic lore,    To her imparted, swell her innate store;    Till, clothed with majesty of mind she stand,  Regent of Natures will, in heart, and head, and hand.                                  LIX.    Each sequent life shall feel her finer care,    Each heir of life a wealthier bounty share;    Those lives allied in equal union chaste    A sweeter purpose, purer rapture, taste;    Both parents vindicate the duteous name,    The troth and kinship of their linked claim;    The only rivalry that moves their mind,  How for their lineage fair still larger fate to find.                                  LX.    Their task ineffable yields wondrous gain,    Their energies celestial force attain;    Their intermingled souls, with passion dight,    In aspiration soar past earthly height;    Nor fades their prospect into void again,    Woman has gift the vision to retain,    And mould their dreams of love, with conscious skill,  To human living types supreme of form and will.                                  LXI.    The psychic and the physical at one    In fervid vigour through their frame shall run;    Their science leaps the bounds of straiter space,    Whose crude dimensions curbed their growing grace;    Whose inefficiencies allowed not verge    For rich research their lofty souls would urge;    To them the keys of life and love are given,  The love that lifts the life from rank of earth to heaven.                                 LXII.    And winged words on which the soul would pierce    Into the height of loves rare Universe    Shall native flow from them as mother tongue    In softest strain to listening infant sung;    Till, the sad memories of unmeant wrong    Solving in music of conciliant song,    Mans destiny with womans blended be  In one sublime progression,full, and strong, and free.

Dogma gives a charterto mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake,and must keep the conscience alive.George Eliot (Middlemarch, Chap.LXXIII.)                     3._Research and reason_ ...As indicated by Professor Oliver T. Lodge, It is but a platitude to saythat our clear and conscious aim should always be truth, and that nolower or meaner standard should ever be allowed to obtrude itself beforeus. Our ancestors fought hard and suffered much for the privilege offree and open inquiry, for the right of conducting investigationuntrammelled by prejudice and foregone conclusions, and they were readyto examine into any phenomenon which presented itself.... Fear ofavowing interest or of examining into unorthodox facts is, I venture tosay, not in accordance with the highest traditions of the scientificattitude.(Address as President of the Mathematical and PhysicalSection of the British Association, 1891.)See also the words of Richard Jefferies:Research proceeds upon thesame old lines and runs in the ancient grooves.... But there should beno limit placed on the mind.... Most injurious of all is the continuouscircling on the same path, and it is from this that I wish to free mymind.(The Story of My Heart, Chap. X.)                       5.... _part revealed_.We are still the early settlers in a beautiful world, whosecapabilities, imperfectly known as yet, wait until higher developmentsof man can understand them fully, and apply the result to the generalgood.Professor T. Rupert Jones (Address as President of the GeologicalSection of the British Association, 1891).                                  II.                    3.... _keener conscience_ ...Cest lincarnation de lide qui se dresse tout  coup en face desvieilles traditions obstines et insuffisantes et elle vient ... posersa revendication personelle et ncessaire contre les lois jadisexcellentes, mais qui, les murs stant modifies, apparaissentsubitement comme des injustices et des barbaries.A.

(Hart-Leap Well.)                                  VI.                      1.... _prehistoric hour_.The preface of general history must be compiled from the materialspresented by barbarism. Happily, if we may say so, these materials areabundant. So unequally has the species been developed, that almost everyconceivable phase of progress may be studied, as somewhere observed andrecorded. And thus the philosopher, fenced from mistake as to the orderof development, by the inter-connection of the stages and their shadingsinto one another by gentle gradations, may draw a clear and decidedoutline of the course of human progress in times long antecedent tothose to which even philology can make reference.MLennan (PrimitiveMarriage, p. 9)...._Id._... I will confine myself to these examples, gleaned from allparts, and which it would be easy to multiply. They amply suffice toestablish that, in primitive societies, woman, being held in very lowesteem, is absolutely reduced to the level of chattels and of domesticanimals; that she represents a booty like any other; that her master canuse and abuse her without fear. But in these bestial practices there isnothing which approaches even distantly to marriage, and we are not inthe least warranted to call these brutal rapes marriages.Letourneau(Evolution of Marriage, Chap. VI.).                      2.... _woman thrall_ ...Woman was the first human being that tasted bondage. Woman was a slavebefore the slave existed.August Bebel (Woman, Chap. I.)._Id._... From the very earliest twilight of human society, every woman(owing to the value attached to her by man, combined with herinferiority in muscular strength) was found in a state of bondage tosome man.J. S. Mill (The Subjection of Woman, Chap. I.)._Id._... In every country, and in every time, woman, organically weakerthan man, has been more or less enslaved by him.Letourneau (TheEvolution of Marriage, Chap. XI.)._Id._... It raised up the humble and fallen, gave spirit and strength to the    poor, And is freeing from slavery Woman, the slave of all ages gone by. C. G. Leland (The Return of the Gods).                       3.... _heinous skill_.It is pitiful to reflect that mans vaunted superiority over the brute,the greater activity of his brain, and the subtler cunning of his hand,have for so long lent themselves to the oppression that has resulted insuch pernicious consequences, and in the still existent slavery, socialand physical, of the female of his own species.Ben Elmy (Studies inMaterialism, Chap. III.).                       8.... _soulless gloom_.Compare the following picture of the somewhat parallel condition of alower race at the present time:  Natives may well call the monkey sire Maharaja, for he is the very  type and incarnation of savage and sensual despotism. They are right,  too, in making their Hanuman red, for the old males face is of the  dusky red you see in some elderly, overfed human faces. Like human  Maharajas, they have their tragedies and mayhap their romances. One  morning there came a monkey chieftain, weak and limping, having  evidently been worsted in a severe fight with another of his own kind.  One hand hung powerless, his face and eyes bore terrible traces of  battle, and he hirpled slowly along with a pathetic air of suffering,  supporting himself on the shoulder of a female, a wife, the only  member of his clan who had remained faithful to him after his defeat.  We threw them bread and raisins, and the wounded warrior carefully  stowed the greater part away in his cheek pouch. The faithful wife,  seeing her opportunity, sprang on him, holding fast his one sound  hand, and, opening his mouth, she deftly scooped out the store of  raisins. Then she sat and ate them very calmly at a safe distance,  while he mowed and chattered in impotent rage. He knew that without  her help he could not reach home, and was fain to wait with what  patience he might till the raisins were finished. It was a sad sight,  but, like more sad sights, touched with the light of comedy. This was  probably her first chance of disobedience or of self-assertion in her  whole life, and I am afraid she thoroughly enjoyed it. Then she led  him away.J. Lockwood Kipling (Beast and Man in India).                                  VII.                        1.... _Evolution_ ...We now know that Nature, as an anthropomorphic being, does not exist;that the great forces called natural are unconscious; that their blindaction results, however, in the world of life, in a choice, aselection, a progressive evolution, or, to sum up, in the survival ofthe individuals best adapted to the conditions of theirexistence.Letourneau (The Evolution of Marriage, Chap. I., PartII.)._Id._... Robert Chamberss common-sense view of evolution as a processof continued growing.Professor Patrick Geddes and J. Arthur Thomson(The Evolution of Sex, p. 302).                           3._By Art_ ...Other implements of Palolithic age are formed of bone and horn. Amongthese are harpoon-heads, barbed on one or both sides, awls, pins, andneedles with well-formed eyes. But by far the most noteworthy objects ofthis class are the fragments of bone, horn, ivory, and stone, whichexhibit outlined and even shaded sketches of various animals. Theseengravings have been made with a sharp-pointed implement, and are oftenwonderfully characteristic representations of the creatures theypourtray. The figures are sometimes single, in other cases they aredrawn in groups. We find representations of a fish, a seal, an ibex, thered-deer, the great Irish elk or deer, the bison, the horse, thecave-bear, the reindeer, and the mammoth or woolly elephant. Besidesengravings, we meet also with sculptures.... It is impossible to say towhat use all these objects were put. Some of them may have been handlesfor knives, while others are mere fragments, and only vague guesses canbe made as to the nature of the original implements. It is highlyprobable, however, that many of these works of art may have beendesigned simply as such, for the pleasure and amusement of thedraughtsman and his fellows.James Geikie (Prehistoric Europe, Chap.II.)._Id._... The culture or appreciation of Art is of itself evidence of ahigher nature in man; a soul, a psyche, a something which aspires, asRichard Jefferies calls it. For though the professional pursuit of Artmay be occasionally not unmingled with mercenary motives, or with thepourtrayal of incentives to lower desire, yet the ultimate appeal ofevery truly beautiful picture or object of Art is, at any rate, not tomans mercenary or meaner nature. As Jefferies again says, The asceticsare the only persons who are impure. The soul is the higher even bygazing on beauty.(The Story of My Heart, Chap. VII.)                        7.... _the soul_ ...The mind of man is infinite. Beyond this, man has a soul. I do not usethis word in the common-sense which circumstances have given to it. Iuse it as the only term to express that inner consciousness whichaspires.Richard Jefferies (The Story of My Heart, Chap. IX.).                  8.... _from lower flush of lust_.The fact to be insisted upon is this, that the vague sexual attractionof the lowest organisms has been evolved into a definite reproductiveimpulse, into a desire often predominating over even that ofself-preservation; that this, again, enhanced by more and more subtleadditions, passes by a gentle gradient into the love of the highestanimals, and of the average human individual.Geddes and Thomson(Evolution of Sex, p. 267).                                 VIII.          5, 6._The voice erst roused by hunger or by rage,                 Now tells the nobler passions of the age._The impassioned orator, bard, or musician, when, with his varied tonesand cadences, he excites the strongest emotions in his hearers, littlesuspects that he uses the same means by which, at an extremely remoteperiod, his half-human ancestors aroused each others ardent passionsduring their mutual courtship and rivalry.Darwin (The Descent ofMan, Chap. XIX.).           7.... _with loves language is uplifted love_.Language is thought, we are told; so also is love. And thus thereciprocal and cumulative action of love, thought, and language stands acorollary to Max Mllers words:Language and thought are inseparable.Words without thought are dead sounds; thoughts without words arenothing. To think is to speak low; to speak is to think aloud. The wordis the thought incarnate.(Science of Language, Lect. IX.)_Id._... Even the rude Australian girl (aborigine) sings in a strain ofromantic affliction:                 I shall never see my darling again.Westermarck (History of Human Marriage, p. 503)._Id._... And again, another benefit accrues to the race from marriagesof affection. Do not your ancient epics which sing of love sing also ofnoble deeds and acts of heroism on the part both of men and women,actuated by a pure affection for each other? Alike in your dramas and inthose of Shakespeare, and of all great writers, love is the great motivepower which impels to deeds of prowess, the spring of noble actions, ofunselfish devotion, of words and thoughts which have enriched all latergenerations, the one sentiment which elevates marriage amongst mankindto something infinitely higher and purer than the gratification of amere animal instinct.Dr. Edith Pechey Phipson (Address to the Hindoosof Bombay on Child Marriage, 1891, p. 14).                      8.... _selfless thought_. Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with might; Smote the chord of Self that, trembling, passd in music out of sight.                 Tennyson (Locksley Hall).                                  IX.                     7.... _Neglecting none_ ...We are entering into an order of things in which justice will be theprimary virtue, grounded on equal, but also on sympathetic association;having its roots no longer in the instinct of equals forself-protection, but in a cultivated sympathy between them; and no onebeing now left out, but an equal measure being extended to all.J. S.Mill (The Subjection of Women, p. 80).                                   X.                4.... _clogged_ ... _mans power_ ...He has reaped the usual reward of selfishness, the gratification ofimmediate low desires has frustrated the future attainment of higheraspirations.Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address to Hindoos).        5, 6._Egypt or Greece in vain sought heavenly light,               While womans soul was held from equal flight._In Egypt the art (of literature) was practised only by the priests, asthe painted history plainly declares.... No female is depicted in theact of reading.... The Greek world was composed of municipalaristocracies, societies of gentlemen living in towns, with their farmsin the neighbourhood, and having all their work done for them by slaves.They themselves had nothing to do but to cultivate their bodies byexercise in the gymnasium, and their minds by conversation in themarket-place. They lived out of doors, whilst their wives remained shutup at home. In Greece a lady could only enter society by adopting a modeof life which in England usually facilitates her exit.Winwood Reade(The Martyrdom of Man, pp. 35, 71).                     8.... _subjugated wife_ ...At Athens the free citizen women lived in strict and almost Orientalrecluseness, as well after being married as when single. Everythingwhich concerned their lives, their happiness, or their rights, wasdetermined or managed for them by their male relatives; and they seem tohave been destitute of all mental culture and accomplishments.Grote(History of Greece, Vol. VI., p. 133).                                  XI.        1._Marriage which might have been a mateship sweet._In vain Plato urged that young men and women should be more frequentlypermitted to meet one another, so that there should be less enmity andindifference in the married life. (Nomoi, Book VI.)Westermarck(History of Human Marriage, p. 361).                       2.... _equal souls_ ...The feeling which makes husband and wife true companions for better andworse, can grow up only in societies where the altruistic sentiments ofman are strong enough to make him recognise woman as his equal, andwhere she is not shut up as an exotic plant in a greenhouse, but isallowed to associate freely with men. In this direction Europeancivilisation has been advancing for centuries.Westermarck (_loc.cit._). (See also Note XIX., 6.)      7, 8._Her only hope of thought or learning wide,              Some freer lot to seek than yoke forlorn of bride_.In Greece the modest women were confined to their own apartments, andwere visited only by their husbands and nearest relations.... Thecourtesans of Athens, by living in public, and conversing freely withall ranks of people, upon all manner of subjects, acquired, by degrees,a knowledge of history, of philosophy, of policy, and a taste in thewhole circle of the arts. Their ideas were more extensive and various,and their conversation was more sprightly and entertaining than anythingthat was to be found among the virtuous part of the sex. Hence theirhouses became the schools of elegance; that of Aspasia was the resort ofSocrates and Pericles, and, as Greece was governed by eloquent men, overwhom the courtesans had an influence, the latter also influenced publicaffairs.Alexander Walker (Woman, as to Mind, &c., p. 334).                                  XII.                   3.... _craving mental food_ ...That the quest of knowledge and intellectual power was literally theincentive to many a woman who accepted the life of _hetaira_ isindisputable. Westermarck says:It seems to me much more reasonable tosuppose that if, in Athens and India, courtesans were respected andsought after by the principal men, it was because they were the onlyeducated women.(History of Marriage, p. 81.)And Letourneau remarks:Religious prostitution, which was widely spreadin Greek antiquity, has been also found in India, where every temple ofrenown had its bayadres, the only women in India to whom, until quiterecently, any instruction was given.(Evolution of Marriage, Chap.III.)           5, 6._Conceding that, might lead a learned life                   A license vetoed to the legal wife_._Hetairai_, famous at once for their beauty and intellect such asPhryne, Las of Corinth, Gnathna, and Aspasia, were objects ofuniversal admiration among the most distinguished Greeks. They wereadmitted to their assemblies and banquets, while the honest women ofGreece were, without exception, confined to the house.... A considerablenumber of women preferred the greater freedom which they enjoyed _asHetairai_ to marriage, and carried on the trade of prostitution as ameans of livelihood. In unrestrained intercourse with men, the moreintelligent of the _Hetairai_, who were doubtless often of good birth,acquired a far greater degree of versatility and culture than thatpossessed by the majority of married women, living in a state ofenforced ignorance and bondage. This invested the _Hetairai_ with agreater charm for the men, in addition to the arts which they employedin the special exercise of their profession. This explains the fact thatmany of them enjoyed the esteem of some of the most distinguished andeminent men of Greece, to whom they stood in a relationship ofinfluential intimacy, a position held by no legitimate wife. The namesof these _Hetairai_ are famous to the present day, while one enquires invain after the names of the legitimate wives.August Bebel (Woman,Chap. I.).                    7.... _wealth, or ... fame_._E.g._, Phryne, who offered to rebuild the wall of Thebes; and Las,commemorated in the adage, _Non cuivis hominum contingit adireCorinthum_. And as to even modern fame, a writer so mercilessconcerning her own sex as Mrs. Lynn Linton can yet say, Agnes Sorel,like Aspasia, was one of the rare instances in history where failure inchastity did not include moral degradation nor unpatrioticself-consideration.(_Nineteenth Century_, July, 1891, p. 84.)                     8.... _the tinge of shame_.Why indeed should shame have attached specially to those women, morehighly cultured and better treated than wives; and whose soleimpeachment could be that they rejected the still lower serfdom ofwedded bondage?                                 XIII.            2._To him who fixed the gages of the fight_.If we could imagine a Bossuet or a Fnlon figuring among the followersof Ninon de Lenclos, and publicly giving her counsel on the subject ofher professional duties, and the means of securing adorers, this wouldbe hardly less strange than the relation which really existed betweenSocrates and the courtesan Theodota.Lecky (History of EuropeanMorals, Vol. II., p. 280).                  8._The waste of woman worth_ ...Since these words were written, a letter from Mrs. Mona Caird has beenpublished by the Womens Emancipation Union, in which is said:So farfrom giving safety and balance to the natural forces, thesetime-honoured restrictions, springing from a narrow theory which tookits rise in a pre-scientific age, are fraught with the gravest dangers,creating a perpetual struggle and unrest, filling society with theperturbations and morbid developments of powers that ought to bespending themselves freely and healthfully on their natural objects.Anyone who has looked a little below the surface of womens lives cantestify to the general unrest and nervous exhaustion or _malaise_ amongthem, although each would probably refer her suffering to some causepeculiar to herself and her circumstances, never dreaming that she wasthe victim of an evil that gnaws at the very heart of society, making ofalmost every woman the heroine of a silent tragedy. I think few keenobservers will deny that it is almost always the women of placidtemperament, with very little sensibility, who are happy and contented;those of more highly wrought nervous systems and imaginative faculty,who are nevertheless capable of far greater joy than their calmersisters, in nine cases out of ten are secretly intensely miserable. Andthe cause of this is not eternal and unalterable. The nervouslyorganised being is _not_ created to be miserable; but when intense vitalenergy is thwarted and misdirectedso long as the energy laststheremust be intense suffering.... It is only when resignation sets in, whenthe ruling order convinces at last and tires out the rebel nerves andthe keen intelligence, that we know that the living forces are defeated,and that death has come to quiet the suffering. All this is waste ofhuman force, and far worse than waste._Id._... Alexandre Dumas fils says:Celles-l voient, de jour en jour,en sondant lhorizon toujours le mme, seffeuiller dans lisolement,dans linaction, dans limpuissance, les facults divines qui leuravaient dabord fait faire de si beaux rves et dont il leur semble quelexpansion et pu tre matriellement et moralement si profitable auxautres et  elles-memes.(Les Femmes qui Tuent et les Femmes quiVotent, p. 107)._Id._... And Lady Florence Dixie has written:Nature gives strength andbeauty to man, and Nature gives strength and beauty to woman. In thislatter instance man flies in the face of Nature, and declares that shemust be artificially restrained. Woman must not be allowed to grow upstrong like man, because if she did the fact would establish herequality with him, and this cannot be tolerated. So the boy and man areallowed freedom of body, and are trained up to become muscular andstrong, while the woman, by artificial, not natural, laws, is bidden toremain inactive and passive, and, in consequence, weak and undeveloped.Mentally it is the same. Nature has unmistakably given to woman agreater amount of brain power. This is at once perceivable in childhood.For instance, on the stage, girls are always employed in preference toboys, for they are considered brighter and sharper in intellect andbrain power. Yet man deliberately sets himself to stunt that earlyevidence of mental capacity by laying down the law that womanseducation shall be on a lower level than that of mans; that naturaltruths, which all women should early learn, should be hidden from her;and that while men may be taught everything, women must only acquire anarrow and imperfect knowledge both of life and of Natures laws. Imaintain that this procedure is arbitrary and cruel, and false toNature. I characterise it by the strong word of infamous. It has beenthe means of sending to their graves, unknown, unknelled, and unnamed,thousands of women whose high intellects have been wasted, and whosepowers for good have been paralysed and undeveloped.(Gloriana: or,the Revolution of 1900, p. 130.)_Id._... Buckle gives numerous instances which support the foregoingassertions, saying himself on the point:That women are more deductivethan men, because they think quicker than men, is a proposition whichsome persons will not relish, and yet it may be proved in a variety ofways. Indeed, nothing could prevent its being universally admittedexcept the fact that the remarkable rapidity with which women think isobscured by that miserable, that contemptible, that preposterous systemcalled their education, in which valuable things are carefully kept fromthem, and trifling things carefully taught to them, until their fine andnimble minds are irreparably injured.(Miscellaneous Works, Vol. I.,p. 8, On the influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge.)_Id._... As a man of straightforward common-sense, Sydney Smith has lefta name unsurpassed in our literary history. Here is something of what hesays on this question of womans intellect and its waste:As the matterstands at present, half the talent in the universe runs to waste, and istotally unprofitable. It would have been almost as well for the world,hitherto, that women, instead of possessing the capacities they do atpresent, should have been born wholly destitute of wit, genius, andevery other attribute of mind of which men make so eminent a use; andthe ideas of use and possession are so united together that, because ithas been the custom in almost all countries to give to women a differentand worse education than to men, the notion has obtained that they donot possess faculties which they do not cultivate.(Essay on FemaleEducation.)_Id._... Hear also John Ruskin on the relative intellect or capacity ofwomen:Let us try, then, whether we cannot get at some clear andharmonious idea (and it must be harmonious if it is true) of whatwomanly mind and virtue are in power and office, with respect to mans;and how their relations, rightly accepted, aid and increase the vigour,and honour, and authority of both.... Let us see whether the greatest,the wisest, the purest-hearted of all ages are agreed in anywise on thispoint.... And first let us take Shakespeare; ... there is hardly a playthat has not a perfect woman in it, steadfast in grave hope anderrorless purpose.... Such, in broad light, is Shakespeares testimonyto the position and character of women in human life. He represents themas infallibly faithful and wise counsellors, incorruptibly just and pureexamples, strong always to sanctify, even when they cannot save.... Iask you next to receive the witness of Walter Scott.... So that, in allcases, with Scott as with Shakespeare, it is the woman who watches over,teaches, and guides the youth; it is never, by any chance, the youth whowatches over or educates his mistress.Now I could multiply witness upon witness of this kind upon you, if Ihad time. Nay, I could go back into the mythical teaching of the mostancient times, and show you how the great people, how that greatEgyptian people, wisest then of nations, gave to their Spirit of Wisdomthe form of a woman; and into her hand, for a symbol, the weaversshuttle; and how the name and form of that spirit adopted, believed, andobeyed by the Greeks, became that Athena of the olive-helm and cloudyshield, to whose faith you owe, down to this date, whatever you holdmost precious in art, in literature, or in types of national virtue.But I will not wander into this distant and mythical element; I willonly ask you to give the legitimate value to the testimony of thesegreat poets and men of the world, consistent as you see it is on thishead. I will ask you whether it can be supposed that these men, in themain work of their lives, are amusing themselves with a fictitious andidle view of the relations between man and woman; nay, worse thanfictitious or idle, for a thing may be imaginary yet desirable, if itwere possible; but this, their ideal of women, is, according to ourcommon idea of the marriage relation, wholly undesirable. The woman, wesay, is not to guide nor even to think for herself. The man is always tobe the wiser; he is to be the thinker, the ruler, the superior inknowledge and discretion, as in power. Is it not somewhat important tomake up our minds on this matter? Are Shakespeare and schylus, Danteand Homer merely dressing dolls for us; or, worse than dolls, unnaturalvisions, the realisation of which, were it possible, would bring anarchyinto all households, and ruin into all affections? Are all these greatmen mistaken, or, are we?(Sesame and Lilies, p. 125, _et seq._)Truly, in the face of these things, Tennyson had reason concerning hisfellow men, when he wrote:            Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers....                                          (Locksley Hall.)                                  XIV.                        3.... _lostling_ ...Between the most cultured _hetairai_ and the poor outcast as here shown,were many intervening or coalescing grades. Instance, as one of thephases, the following sketch of an Indian courtesan:Lalun is a memberof the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was hervery-great-grandmama, and that was before the days of Eve, as everyoneknows. In the West, people say rude things about Laluns profession, andwrite lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young people, inorder that morality may be preserved. In the East, where the professionis hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writeslectures or takes any notice.Rudyard Kipling (On the City Wall)._Id._... _worse than brutal woes_ ...Dumas fils, who knew well whereof he wrote, tells of Les femmes dupeuple et de la campagne, suant du matin au soir pour gagner le painquotidien, le dos courb, domptes par la misre: of whom some of thedaughters sortent du groupe par le chemin tentant et facile de laprostitution, mais o le labeur est encore plus rude.(Les Femmes quiTuent et les Femmes qui Votent, p. 101.) As historical instance ofdepth of wretched degradation, _conf._ medival privilege of _scortumante mortem_, conceded to some of even the vilest and lowest ofcriminals condemned to capital punishment. Though such a condition isbarely more than parallel to the pitch of infamy of modern times, asinstanced in a quotation reproduced by John Ruskin, in Sesame andLilies, p. 91, first ed.:  The salons of Mme. C., who did the honours with clever imitative  grace and elegance, were crowded with princes, dukes, marquises, and  counts, in fact, with the same _male_ company as one meets at the  parties of the Princess Metternich and Madame Drouyn de Lhuys. Some  English peers and members of Parliament were present, and appeared to  enjoy the animated and dazzlingly improper scene. On the second floor  the supper-tables were loaded with every delicacy of the season. That  your readers may form some idea of the dainty fare of the Parisian  _demi-monde_, I copy the _menu_ of the supper which was served to all  the guests (about 200) seated, at four oclock. Choice Yquem,  Johannisberg, Lafitte, Tokay, and Champagne of the finest vintages  were served most lavishly throughout the morning. After supper dancing  was resumed with increased animation, and the ball terminated with a  _chaine diabolique_ and a _cancan denfer_ at seven in the  morning.(_Morning Post_, March 10th, 1865.)To which perhaps the most fitting comment is certain words ofLetourneaus:It is important to make a distinction. The resemblancebetween the moral coarseness of the savage and the depravation of thecivilised man is quite superficial.... The brutality of the savage hasnothing in common with the moral retrogression of the civilised man,struck with decay.... The posterity of the savage may, with the aid oftime and culture, attain to great moral elevation, for there are vitalforces within him which are fresh and intact. The primitive man is stillyoung, and he possesses many latent energies susceptible of development.In short, the savage is a child, while the civilised man, whose moralnature is corrupt, presents to us rather the picture of decrepit oldage.(Evolution of Marriage, Chap. V.)If M. Letourneau will apply his strictures as to senility and decay toso-called Society and its system, rather than to the individual, hewill find many thinkers, both of his own and other nationalities, agreewith his conclusion. Yet not death, but reform, is the righter event toindicate. And by what means that reform may be ensured is, at least inpart, clearly set forth in the following passage from a paper recentlypublished by the Womens Printing Society:  My positive belief is that women, and women alone, will be able to  reverse the worlds verdict, but they must change their method of  reform in two important matters.  First and foremost, every mother must teach her daughters the truth,  the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the relations of the  sexes, the condition of social opinion, the historical, physiological,  ethical aspects of the question. She must train herself so as to be  able to teach the young minds these solemn, serious aspects of life,  in such a way that the world may learn that the innocence of ignorance  is inferior to the purity of right-minded, fearless knowledge. She  must strengthen the minds and form the judgment of her daughters, so  that they may demand reciprocal purity in those whom they would  espouse.  I fully understand the difficulty of teaching our pure-minded,  delicately-nurtured daughters the terrible lessons of this seamy side  of life. I am a mother of daughters myself, and I know the cost at  which the courage has to be obtained, but in this matter each mother  must help another. What a mighty force is influence! What help is  conveyed by pressure of opinion! How often do I remember with  gratitude the words which I once read as quoted of Mrs. John Stuart  Mill, who taught her little daughter to have the courage to hear what  other little girls had to bear. How gladly I acknowledge the stimulus  of that example to myself, and therefore I would urge all women to  SPEAK OUT. Do not be afraid. You will not lose your womanliness. You  will not lose your purity. You will not have your sensibilities  blunted by such rough use. No, To the pure all things are pure. We  must reach the mass through the unit, it is the individual who helps  to move the world.  We must teach and train the mind of every woman with whom we come in  contact, for we have mighty work to do. A no less deed than to reverse  the judgment of the whole world on the subject of purity. I do not  believe it is possible for men to accomplish any radical reform in  this matter. It belongs to womenI was going to say exclusivelybut I  will modify my assertion; and if women do not speak out more  courageously in the future than they have done in the past, I believe  there is but slight chance of any further amelioration in the  condition of society than those which are such an inadequate return at  the present time, for all the love and money expended on them.And the same writer says, on a still more recent occasion: I find nowords strong enough to denounce the sin of silence amongst women onthese social evils; and I have come to feel that the best proof of thesubjection and degradation of my sex lies in the opinions oftenexpressed by so-called Christian and pure women _about other women_. Iftheir judgments were not perverted, if their wills were not broken, iftheir consciences were not asleep, and if their souls were not enslaved,they would not, they could not, hold their peace and let the havoc go onwith women and children as it does.Mrs. Laura E. Morgan-Browne(_Womans Herald_, 27th Feb., 1892).Mrs. Morgan-Browne is, perhaps, not more than needfully severe on thealmost criminal reticence of women; yet man must certainly take thegreater share of blame for the social double morality which condemnsirrevocably a woman, and leaves practically unscathed a man, for thesame act. It is male-made laws and rules that have resulted in theperverted judgments, broken wills, sleeping consciences, and enslavedsouls, which both sexes may deplore. Charles Kingsley pointed a cogenttruth when he said that Women will never obtain moral equity until theyhave civil equality. (See also Note XXXV., 6.)                                  XV.         2.... _womans griefs with man of barbarous breed_.In all barbarous societies the subjection of woman is more or lesssevere; customs or coarse laws have regulated the savagery of the firstanarchic ages; they have doubtless set up a barrier against primitiveferocity, they have interdicted certain absolutely terrible abuses offorce, but they have only replaced these by a servitude which is stillvery heavy, is often iniquitous, and no longer permits tolegally-possessed women those escapes, or capriciously accordedliberties, which were tolerated in savage life.Letourneau (Evolutionof Marriage, Chap. XIV.).            4._Crippled and crushed by cruelty and toil_.Some of this crippling has been of set purpose, as well as the simpleresult of brutal male recklessness. Instance the distortion of the feetof high-born female children in China, the tradition concerning which isthat the practice was initiated and enjoined by an emperor of old, oneof whose wives had (literally) run away from him. A somewhat similarprecaution would seem to be indicated as a very probable source of thepersistent and almost universal incommodity and incumbrance of the dressof woman as compared with that of man.Dr. Thomas Inman, in his Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names,Vol. I., p. 53, seems to indicate a different, yet closely allied,origin and motive for the impeding form of womans clothing, thesubordinate status of woman being always the purpose in view._Id._... Even supposing a woman to give no encouragement to heradmirers, many plots are always laid to carry her off. In the encounterswhich result from these, she is almost certain to receive some violentinjury, for each of the combatants orders her to follow him, and, in theevent of her refusing, throws a spear at her. The early life of a youngwoman at all celebrated for beauty is generally one continued series ofcaptivities to different masters, of ghastly wounds, of wandering instrange families, of rapid flights, of bad treatment from other femalesamongst whom she is brought, a stranger, by her captor; and rarely doyou see a form of unusual grace and elegance but it is marked andscarred by the furrows of old wounds; and many a female thus wandersseveral hundred miles from the home of her infancy, being carried offsuccessively to distant and more distant points.Sir George Grey(Travels in North-Western Australia, 1841, Vol. II., p. 249; quoted inMLennan on Primitive Marriage, p. 75).              5.... _her heart a gentle mien essayed_.Woman seems to differ from man in mental disposition, chiefly ingreater tenderness and less selfishness, and this holds good even withsavages, as shown by a well-known passage in Mungo Parks Travels, andby statements made by other travellers. Woman, owing to her maternalinstincts, displays these qualities towards her infants in an eminentdegree; therefore it is likely that she should often extend them towardsher fellow creatures.... Mungo Park heard the negro women teachingtheir young children to love the truth.Darwin (The Descent of Man,Chaps. IX., III.).           6._By deeper passion, holier impulse, swayed_.Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham well says:Woman has accepted her subordinatelot, and lived in it with comparatively little moral harm, as the onlytruly superior and noble being could have done. The masculine spirit,enslaved and imprisoned, becomes diabolic or broken; the feminine, onlywarped, weakened, or distorted, is ready, whenever the pressure upon itis removed, to assume its true attitude.(Woman and Her Era, PartIV.)_Id._... Perhaps as appositely here, as elsewhere, may be recorded thefollowing:An American writer says: While I lived among the ChoctawIndians, I held a consultation with one of their chiefs respecting thesuccessive stages of their progress in the arts of civilised life, and,among other things, he informed me that at their start they made a greatmistake, they only sent boys to school. Their boys came home intelligentmen, but they married uneducated and uncivilised wives, and the uniformresult was that the children were all like their mothers. The fathersoon lost all his interest both in wife and children. And now, said he,if we could educate but one class of our children, we should choose thegirls, for, when they become mothers, they educate their sons. This isthe point, and it is true.(_Manchester Examiner and Times_, Sept.,1870.)         8.... _mother-love alone the infant oft preserved_.In Polynesia, if a child was born, the husband was free to kill theinfant, which was done by applying a piece of wet stuff to the mouth andnose, or to let it live; but, in the latter case, he generally kept thewife for the whole of her life. If the union was sterile, or thechildren put to death, the man had always the right to abandon the womanwhen and how it seemed good to him.Letourneau (Evolution ofMarriage, p. 113)._Id._... An Arab legend tells of a chief of Tamin, who became a constantpractitioner of infanticide in consequence of a wound given to hispride ... and from that moment he interred alive all his daughters,according to the ancient custom. But one day, during his absence, adaughter was born to him, whom the mother secretly sent to a relative tosave her, and then declared to her husband that she had been deliveredof a still-born child.(R. Smith, on Kinship, p. 282; quoted byLetourneau, Evolution of Marriage, p. 83.)_Id._... Charles Darwin writes of Tierra del Fuego:The husband is tothe wife a brutal master to a laborious slave. Was a more horrid deedever perpetrated than that witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who sawa wretched mother pick up her bleeding, dying infant-boy, whom herhusband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket ofsea-eggs!(Voyage of the _Beagle_, Chap. X.)_Id._... Mrs. Reichardt tells of a certain Moslem, of high standing inthe society of Damascus, who married a young girl of ten, and, aftershe had born him two sons, he drove her almost mad with such cruelty andunkindness that she escaped, and went back to her father. Her husbandsent for her to return, and, as she was hidden out of his sight, hewrung the necks of both his sons, and sent their bodies to his wife toshow her what he had in store for her. The young mother, not yet twenty,died in a few days.(See _Nineteenth Century_, June, 1891.)_Id._... It will not be forgotten that, in more than one of the oldercivilisations, the father had the power of life and death over themembers of the family, even past adult age.And, to come to quite recent times, and this our England, Mrs.Wolstenholme Elmy, to whose unflagging energy, during some fifteen yearsof labour, was mainly attributable (as the Parliamentary sponsors of themeasures know) the amelioration in the English law concerning wives andmothers, embodied in the Married Womens Property Acts of 1870 and 1882,together with the later and beneficent Guardianship of Infants Act,1886, relates, in her record of the history of this latter Act:  It will be remembered that so recently as 1883, a young lady  petitioned that she might be allowed to spend her summer holidays with  her own mother, from whom she was separated for no fault of her own or  of her mothers, but in virtue of the supreme legal rights of her  father. The Court refused her petition, natural and proper as it seems  to everyone of human feelings; and the words of the Master of the  Rolls in giving judgment, on the 24th of July, 1883, are more  significant and instructive as to the actual state of the law than the  words of any non-professional writer can be:The law of England  _recognises the rights of the father_, not as the guardian, but  _because he is the father of his children_.... _The rights of the  father are recognised because he is the father_; his duties as a  father are recognised because they are natural duties. The natural  duties of a father are to treat his children with the utmost  affection, and with infinite tenderness.... The law recognises these  duties, from which if a father breaks he breaks from everything which  nature calls upon him to do; and, although the law may not be able to  insist upon their performance, it is because the law recognises them,  and knows that in almost every case the natural feelings of a father  will prevail. The law trusts that the father will perform his natural  duties, and does not, and, indeed, cannot, inquire how they have been  performed.... I am not prepared to say whether _when the child is a  ward of Court, and the conduct of the father is such as to exhaust all  patiencesuch, for instance, as cruelty, or pitiless spitefulness  carried to a great extentthe Court might not interfere. But such  interference will be exercised_ ONLY IN THE UTMOST NEED, AND IN MOST  EXTREME CASES. It is impossible to lay down the rule of the Court more  clearly than has been done by Vice-Chancellor Bacon in the recent case  of _Re._ Plowley (47 L.T., N.S., 283). In saying that this Court,  whatever be its authority or jurisdiction, _has no authority to  interfere with the sacred right of a father over his own children_,  the learned Vice-Chancellor has summed up all that I intended to say.  _The rights of a father are sacred rights, because his duties are  sacred._...  These sacred rights of the father were, it will be observed, in the  eyes of the law so _exclusive_ and paramount as to justify and demand  the refusal to a young girl, at the most critical period of early  womanhood, of the solace of a few weeks intercourse with a blameless  and beloved mother; and this although the gratification of the  daughters wish would have involved no denial to the father of the  solace of his daughters company, since she was not actually, but only  _legally_, in his custody, not having seen him for more than a year.  It will be seen from this that the father alone has the absolute  legal right to deal with his child or children, to the extent of  separating them, at his own sole pleasure, from their mother, and of  giving them into the care and custody of any person whom he may think  fit. The mother has, as such, no legal status, no choice, voice, lot,  or part in the matter.Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy (The Infants Act,  1886, p. 2).It is consolatory to learn that a palliation of some part of the aboveunjust conditions has been achieved; yet how often has our presumedlyhappy land witnessed scenes of child misery and helpless mother-love, towhich was denied even the poor consolation, so pathetically depicted byMrs. Browning, in a scene which, as Moir truly says, weighs on theheart like a nightmare;       Do you hear the children weeping, oh! my brothers!         Ere the sorrow comes with years?       They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,         And _that_ cannot stop their tears.                                  XVI.                      4.... _single basis_ ...First written disproportioned basis, but altered, with good reason, inthe face of Mr. Herbert Spencers arrogant male thesis:Only thatmental energy is normally feminine which can co-exist with theproduction and nursing of the due (!) number of healthychildren.(Study of Sociology, Chap. XV., note 5.)But Professor Huxley speaks, more humanly, of ... such a peasant womanas one sees in the Alps, striding ever upward, heavily burdened, andwith mind bent only on her home; but yet, without effort and withoutthought, knitting for her children. Now stockings are good andcomfortable things, and the children will undoubtedly be much the betterfor them, but surely it would be short-sighted, to say the least of it,to depreciate this toiling mother as a mere stocking-machinea mereprovider of physical comforts.(On Improving Natural Knowledge.)Yet, if it beas truly it isa senseless and disgraceful depreciation ofwoman to look upon her as a mere machine for the making of stockings,is it not equally unworthy and unwise to consider her asprimarily andessentiallya mere machine for the making of a due number ofstocking-wearers?                        5.... _quicker fire_.In even so sedate and usually dispassionate a physiologist andphilosopher as Charles Darwin, the masculine sex-bias is so ingrainedand so ingenuous that he strives to disparage and contemn the notoriousmental quickness or intuition of woman by saying:It is generallyadmitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception,and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; butsome, at least, of these faculties are characteristic of the lowerraces, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.(TheDescent of Man, Chap. XIX.).His unconscious sex-bias apparently overlooked the pregnant and verypertinent caution which he had himself uttered in a previouswork:Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless wehave reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed,ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascentcondition, and in progress towards further development. Rudimentaryorgans, on the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth whichnever cut through the gums, or, almost useless, such as the wings of anostrich, which serve merely as sails.... It is, however, often difficultto distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs, for we can judgeonly by analogy whether a part is capable of further development, inwhich case alone it deserves to be called nascent.(Origin ofSpecies, Chap. XIV.).But surely Darwin would admit that experiment in capacity of educationand development was as worthy evidence as analogy, and would furtheracknowledge how little effort in this direction had ever been made withwoman. Buckle would seem to be far nearer the truth in ascribing towoman an unconscious deductive form of reasoning, as against the slowand studied inductive process to which man is so generally trained to bea slave.(See Buckles Essay on the Influence of Women on the Progressof Knowledge, as quoted from in Note XIII., 8.)                    7.... _one permitted end_ ...The function of child-bearing has been exaggerated to an utterlydisproportionate degree in her life; it has been made her almost soleclaim to existence. Yet it is not the true purpose of any intellectualorganism to live solely to give birth to succeeding organisms; its dutyis also to live for its own happiness and well-being.Ben Elmy(Studies in Materialism, Chap. III.).               _Id._ ... ... not a moth with vain desire               Is shrivelled in a fruitless fire,               Or but subserves anothers gain.

XVII.                   5.... _aspirations crushed_ ...I have found life a series of hopes unfulfilled and wishesungratified.(Dying words of a talented woman.)                     6.... _purblind pride_ ...          Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,          And fills up all the mighty void of sense.                                                        Pope.                 7._Her every wish made subject_ ...For a somewhat modern exemplification may be taken the instance ofElizabeth Barrett Browning, in Paris with her husband, in 1852. Shewrites of Georges Sand:She received us in a room with a bed in it, theonly room she has to occupy, I suppose, during her short stay inParis.... Ah, but I didnt see her smoke; I was unfortunate. I couldonly go with Robert three times to her house, and once she was out. Hewas really very good and kind to let me go at all after he found thesort of society rampant around her. He didnt like it extremely, but,being the prince of husbands, he was lenient to my desires, and yieldedthe point.(Life of Robert Browning, by Mrs. Sutherland Orr, 1891.)                          8.... _her God_._Conf._ Milton (Paradise Lost, Book IV., 299):                 He for God only, she for God in him.See Note XXXV., 5. Compare also the Code of Manu, v. 154, as quoted byLetourneau:Although the conduct of her husband may be blameworthy, andhe may give himself up to other amours, and be devoid of good qualities,a virtuous woman ought constantly to revere him as a God.(Evolutionof Marriage, Chap. XIII.)_Id._... Here may fittingly be appended some masculine concepts offeminine duty in other races.The STATUS OF WOMAN, according to the CHINESE Classics:In a periodical published in Shanghai, Dr. Faber, a well-known scholar,writes (1891) a paper on the status of women in China. He refersespecially to the theoretical position assigned to women by the ChineseClassics. These lay down the different dogmas on the subject:  1.Women are as different in nature from man as earth is from heaven.  2.Dualism, not only in body form, but in the very essence of nature,        is indicated and proclaimed by Chinese moralists of all times        and creed. The male belongs to _yang_, the female to _yin_.  3.Death and all other evils have their origin in the _yin_, or        female principle; life and prosperity come from its subjection        to the _yang_ or male principle; and it is therefore regarded as        a law of nature that women should be kept under the control of        men, and not be allowed any will of their own.  4.Women, indeed, are human beings, (!) but they are of a lower state        than men, and can never attain to full equality with them.  5.The aim of female education, therefore, is perfect submission, not        cultivation and development of mind.  6.Women cannot have any happiness of their own; they have to live        and work for men.  7.Only as the mother of a son, as the continuator of the direct line        of a family, can a woman escape from her degradation and become        to a certain degree her husbands equal; but then only in        household affairs, especially the female department, and in the        ancestral hall.  8.In the other world, womans condition remains exactly the same,        for the same laws of existence apply. She is not the equal of        her husband; she belongs to him, and is dependent for her        happiness on the sacrifice offered by her descendants.These are the doctrines taught by Confucius, Mencius, and the ancientsages, whose memory has been revered in China for thousands of years.And now, what wonder that Chinese civilisation and progress is, andremains, fossilised, inert, dead?                                 JAPAN.There is one supreme maxim upon which the conduct of a well-bred womanis made to turn, and this is obedience. Life, the Japanese girl istaught, divides itself into three stages of obedience. In youth she isto obey her father; in marriage her husband; in widowhood her eldestson. Hence her preparation for life is always preparation for service.The marriage of the Japanese girl usually takes place when she is aboutseventeen. It is contrary to all custom that she should have any voicein it. Once married, she passes from her fathers household into thehousehold of her husband, and her period of self-abnegation begins. Herown family is to be as nothing to her. Her duty is to charm theexistence of her husband, and to please his relations. Custom demandsthat she shall always smile upon him, and that she shall carefully hidefrom him any signs of bad humour, jealousy, or physical pain.Tinseau(quoted in _Review of Reviews_, Vol. IV., p. 282.)Note well the last two words of the above quotation; they have a bearingon much that will have to be said presently. Meanwhile, we read fromanother writer: The expression, _res angusta domi_, might have beeninvented for Japan, so narrow of necessity is the wifes home life. Thehusband mixes with the world, the wife does not; the husband has beensomewhat inspired, and his thoughts widened by his intercourse withforeigners, the wife has not met them. The husband has more or lessacquaintance with western learning; the wife has none. Affection betweenthe two, within the limits which unequal intellectuality ruthlesslyprescribes, there well may be, but the love which comes of a perfectintimacy, of mutual knowledge and common aspiration, there can rarelybe. The very vocabulary of romantic love does not exist in Japanese; _afortiori_, there is little of the fact. Yet, under the influence ofwestern civilisation, these things are changing rapidly, and Mr. Norman,the commissioner of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, further relates that Thegeneration that is now growing up will be very different. Not only willthe men of it be more western, but the women also. As girls they willhave been to schools like our schools at home, and they will havelearned English, and history, and geography, and science, and foreignmusic; perhaps, even, something of politics and political economy. Theywill know something of society, as we now use the term, and will bothseek it and make it. The old home life will become unbearable to thewoman, and she will demand the right of choosing her husband just asmuch as he chooses her. Then the rest will be easy.The harsh and restrained position, both of Japanese and Chinese women,is frequently attributed to Confucianism; yet the matter does not seemto be of any one creed, but rather of every religious creed. Thus Mrs.Reichardt tells us, concerning Mahommedan women and Mahommedan marriedlife, thatA Mahommedan girl is brought up with the idea that she has nothing todo with love. It is _ayib_ (shame) for her to love her husband. She darenot do it if she would. What he asks and expects of her is to tremblebefore him, and yield him unquestioning obedience. I have _seen_ ahusband look pleased and complacent when his wife looked afraid to liftup her eyes, even when visitors were present.(_Nineteenth Century_,June, 1891.)Nor is Confucius alone, or the simple contagion of his teaching, rightlyto be blamed for the following condition of things in our own dependencyof                                 INDIA.The _Bombay Guardian_ calls attention to an extraordinary book which isbeing circulated (early in 1891) broadcast, as a prize-book in theGovernment Girls School in the Bombay Presidency. The followingquotations are given as specimens of the teachings set forth in thebook:If the husband of a virtuous woman be ugly, of good or bad disposition,diseased, fiendish, irascible, or a drunkard, old, stupid, dumb, blind,deaf, hot-tempered, poor, extremely covetous, a slanderer, cowardly,perfidious, and immoral, nevertheless she ought to worship him as God,with mind, speech, and person.The wife who gives an angry answer to her husband will become a villagepariah dog; she will also become a jackal, and live in an uninhabiteddesert.The woman who eats sweetmeats without sharing them with her husbandwill become a hen-owl, living in a hollow tree.(Conf. Note VI., 8.)The woman who walks alone without her husband will become afilth-eating village sow.The woman who speaks disrespectfully to her husband will be dumb in thenext incarnation.The woman who hates her husbands relations will become from birth tobirth a musk-rat, living in filth.She who is always jealous of her husbands concubine will be childlessin the next incarnation.To illustrate the blessed result of a wifes subserviency, a story istold of the great reward that came to the wife of an ill-tempered,diseased, and wicked Brahmin, who served her husband with a slavishobedience, and even went the length of carrying him on her own shouldersto visit his mistress.So quotes the _Womans Journal_ of Boston, Mass., and says in commentthereon:The British Government in India has bound itself not tointerfere with the religion of the natives, but it certainly ought notto inculcate in Government schools the worst doctrines of heathenism.Yet, again, are these Hindoo, or Japanese, or Chinese doctrines simplythe precepts of heathenism alone? Buckle quotes for us the followingpassage from the Nonconformist Fergusson on the Epistles, 1656, p.242:There is not any husband to whom this honour of submission is notdue. No personal infirmity, frowardness of nature, no, not even on thepoint of religion, doth deprive him of it.Much the same teaching is continued a century later in the noted Dr.Gregorys A Fathers Legacy to his Daughters; and again, hideouslytrue is the picture which Mill has to draw, in 1869:Above all, afemale slave has (in Christian countries) an admitted right, and isconsidered under a moral obligation to refuse to her master the lastfamiliarity. Not so the wife; however brutal a tyrant she mayunfortunately be chained to, though she may know that he hates her,though it may be his daily pleasure to torture her, and though she mayfeel it impossible not to loathe him, he can claim from her and enforcethe lowest degradation of a human being, that of being made theinstrument of an animal function contrary to her inclinations.... Noamount of ill-usage, without adultery superadded, will in England free awife from her tormentor.(The Subjection of Women, pp. 57, 59.)As to how far public feeling, if not law, has amended some of theseconditions, see Note XXXVI., 6. Meanwhile, as an evidence of what is theorthodox opinion and sentiment at this present day, it may be notedthat Cardinal Manning wrote in the _Dublin Review_, July, 1891:A womanenters for life into a sacred contract with a man before God at thealtar to fulfil to him the duties of wife, mother, and head of his home.Is it lawful for her, even with his consent, to make afterwards a secondcontract for so many shillings a week with a millowner whereby shebecomes unable to provide her husbands food, train up her children, ordo the duties of her home? It is no question of the lawfulness ofgaining a few more shillings for the expenses of a family, but of thelawfulness of breaking a prior contract, the most solemn between man andwoman. No arguments of expediency can be admitted. It is an obligationof conscience to which all things must give way. The duties of home mustfirst be done (by the woman) then other questions may be entertained.Are not these English injunctions to womanly and wifely slavery astrenchant and merciless as any ascribed to so-called heathenism? Andis it not the fuller truth that the spirit of the male teaching againstwoman is the same all the world over, and no mere matter of creedwhichis nevertheless made the convenient vehicle for such teaching; and that,in brief, the precepts of womanly and wifely servitude are blind,brutal, and universal?See also Note XXXIV., 8.

We need an increasing education and civism of women.P.Geddes and J. A. Thomson (The Evolution of Sex, p. 297).Newnham and Girton, Vassar and Zurich, are already rendering account ofwomans scope of mental power; while the circus, the gymnasium, swimmingand mountaineering are showing what she might do corporeally, apart fromher hideous and literally impeding style of clothing. As for some otherforms of utilitarian occupation, read the following concerning certainof the Lancashire women:Mr. Edgar L. Wakeman, an observant American author, is at present on avisit to this country, and is giving his countrymen the benefit of hisimpressions of English life and social conditions.The pit-brow lasses of the Wigan district will not need to complain,for he writes of them not only in a kindly spirit, but even withenthusiasm for their healthy looks, graceful figures, and good conduct.We need not follow his description of the processes in which the womenof the colliery are employed, but we may say in passing that Mr. Wakemanwas astonished by the wonderful quickness of eye and movement shown bythe screeners, and by the superb physical development and agility ofthe fillers. He had expected to find them the most forlorn creaturesbearing the image of women, and he found them strong, healthy,good-natured, and thoroughly respectable. English roses glow fromEnglish cheeks. You cannot find plumper figures, prettier forms, moreshapely necks, or daintier feet, despite the ugly clogs, in all ofdreamful Andalusia. The broo gear is laid aside on the return homefrom work, and then the pit-brow lass is arrayed as becomingly as anyof her class in England, and in the village street, or at church of aSunday, you could not pick her out from among her companions, unless forher fine colour, form, and a positively classic poise and grace ofcarriage possessed by no other working women of England. Altogether, hesays, I should seriously regard the pit-brow lasses as the handsomest,healthiest, happiest, and most respectable working women inEngland.(_Manchester Guardian_, Aug. 28, 1891.)_Id._... Concerning the question of male and female dress, evidence asto how far woman has been hindered and handicapped by her conventionalattire, and not by her want of physical strength or courage, is reportedfrom time to time in the public prints, as witness the following,published generally in the English newspapers of 14th Oct., 1891:  Not long since a well-known European courier, having grown grey in  his occupation, fell ill, and like others similarly afflicted, was  compelled to call in a doctor. This gentleman was completely taken by  surprise on discovering that his patient was a female. Then the sick  womanwho had piloted numerous English and American families through  the land of the Latin, the Turk, and others, and led timid tourists  safely through many imaginary dangersconfessed that she had worn  mens clothes for forty years. She stated that her reasons for this  masquerade were that having, at the age of thirteen, been left a  friendless orphan, she had become convinced, after futile struggling  for employment, that many of the obstacles in her path could be swept  away by discarding her proper garments and assuming the _rle_ and  attire of masculine youth. This she did. She closely cut her hair,  bought boys clothes, put them on, and sallied forth in the world to  seek her fortune. With the change of dress seems to have come a change  of luck, for she quickly found employment, and being an apt scholar,  and facile at learning languages, was enabled after a time to obtain a  position as courier, and, but for her unfortunate illness, it is  tolerably certain that the truth would never have been revealed during  her lifetime.In the early days of April, 1892, the Vienna correspondent of the_Standard_ reported that  On the 30th ult., there died in Hungary, at about the same hour, two  ladies who served in 1848 in the Revolutionary Army, and fought in  several of the fiercest battles, dressed in military uniform. One of  them was several times promoted, and, under the name of Karl, attained  the rank of First Lieutenant of Hussars. At this point, however, an  artillery major stopped her military career by marrying her. The other  fought under the name of Josef, and was decorated for valour in the  field. She married long after the campaign. A Hungarian paper,  referring to the two cases, says that about a dozen women fought in  1848 in the insurrectionary ranks.Somewhat more detailed particulars concerning Lieutenant Karl wereafterwards given by the _Manchester Guardian_ (June 6, 1892), asfollows:  The Austrian _Volkszeitung_ announces the death of Frau Marie Hoche,  who has had a most singular and romantic career. Her maiden name was  Lepstuk. In the momentous year of 1848 Marie Lepstuk, who was then  eighteen years of age, joined the German legion at Vienna; then,  returning home, she adopted the name of Karl and joined the Tyroler  Jager Regiment of the revolutionary army. She showed great bravery in  the battlefield, received the medallion, and was raised to the rank of  lieutenant. A wound compelled her to go into hospital, but after her  recovery she joined the Hussars. As a reward for exceeding bravery she  was next made oberlieutenant on the field. Soon after this her sex was  discovered, but a major fell in love with her, and they were married.  At Vilagos both were taken prisoners, and while in the fortress she  gave birth to her first child. After the majors death she was  remarried to Oberlieutenant Hoche. For the past few years Frau Hoche  has been in needy circumstances, but an appeal from Jokai brought  relief.All of which goes far to discredit M. Michelets theory that women areborn invalids, an assertion which Dr. Julia Mitchell stigmatisesnaturally enough as all nonsense, and is thus approvedwith a strangemagnanimityby the _British Medical Journal_.(See _Pall Mall Gazette_,April 29, 1892.)The incapacity of women for military service has been of late dayscontinually quoted as a bar to their right of citizenship, as far as theParliamentary Franchise is concerned. In the face of the foregoingcases, and of the fact that every mother risks her life in becoming amother, while very few men, indeed, risk theirs on the battlefield, itmight be thought that the fallacious argument would have perished fromshame and inanition long ago. But the inconsistencies ofpartly-cultivated, masculine, one-sexed intellect are as stubborn asblind.See also Note XLV., 6.                                  XIX.                6._The ecstasy of earnest souls_ ...Without recognising the possibilities of individual and of racialevolution, we are shut up to the conventional view that the poet and hisheroine alike are exceptional creations, hopelessly beyond the everydayaverage of the race. Whereas, admitting the theory of evolution, we arenot only entitled to the hope, but logically compelled to the assurancethat these rare fruits of an apparently more than earthly paradise oflove, which only the forerunners of the race have been privileged togather, or, it may be, to see from distant heights, are yet therealities of a daily life towards which we and ours may journey.Geddesand Thomson (Evolution of Sex, p. 267)._Id._... What marriage may be in the case of two persons of cultivatedfaculties, identical in opinions and purposes, between whom there existsthat best kind of equality, similarity of powers, and capacities withreciprocal superiority in themso that each can enjoy the pleasure oflooking up to the other, and can have alternately the pleasure ofleading and of being led in the path of developmentI will not attemptto describe. To those who can conceive it there is no need; to those whocannot, it would appear the dream of an enthusiast. But I maintain, withthe profoundest conviction, that this, and this only, is the ideal ofmarriage; and that all opinions, customs, and institutions which favourany other notion of it, or turn the conceptions and aspirationsconnected with it into any other direction, by whatever pretences theymay be coloured, are relics of primitive barbarism. The moralregeneration of mankind will only really commence when the mostfundamental of the social relations is placed under the rule of equaljustice, and when human beings learn to cultivate their strongestsympathy with an equal in rights and cultivation.J. S. Mill (TheSubjection of Women, p. 177).

XXI.                     1.... _carnal servitude_...It may be objected by some that details in the verse or in these notesare of too intimate a character for general narration. The notes have,however, all been taken either from widely read public prints ofindisputable singleness of purpose, or works of writers of undoubtedintegrity. One is not much troubled as to those who would criticisefurther. To them may be offered the incident and words of the late Dr.Magee, who, as Bishop of Peterborough, and a member of a legislativecommittee on the question of child-life insurance, said:In this matterwe have to count with two things: first, almost all our facts aresecrets of the bedchamber; and, secondly, we are opposed by great vestedinterests. This thing is not to be done without a good deal ofpain.(_Review of Reviews_, Vol. IV., p. 37).And thus are verified, in a transcendental sense also, the words ofSchiller:                 Und _in feurigem Bewegen_                 Werden alle Krfte kund.

XXII.                1.... _girlhoods helpless years_ ...Somewhat as to these ancient conditions may be gathered from theposition in India at the present day. Read the following:The practiceof early marriages by Hindoos I was, of course, informed of by readingbefore coming to India, but its mention in books was always coupled withthe assertion that in India girls reach puberty at a much earlier agethan in cold climates. Judge, therefore, of my surprise to find that sofar from Hindoo girls being precocious in physical development, they aremuch behind in this respect; that a Hindoo girl of fifteen is about theequal of an English child of eleven, instead of the reverse, and thatthe statements made to the contrary by Englishmen who have noopportunity of becoming acquainted with Hindoo family life, were totallymisleading. In the first place they were under the impression thatmarriage never takes place before puberty, and, secondly, they acceptedthe Hindoo view as to what constitutes puberty. You know that,unfortunately, they were misled as regards the first point. I hope toshow you that in the second place the idea which they accepted ascorrect is a totally mistaken one.Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Addressto the Hindoos of Bombay on the subject of child-marriage; delivered atthe Hall of the Prarthana Somaj, Bombay, on the 11th Oct., 1890).                        2.... _sexual wrong_.As regards the marriage of girls before even what is called puberty, Ican hardly trust myself to speak, so strongly are my feelings those ofall Westernmay I not say of all civilised?people in looking upon it asactually criminal. Ah! gentlemen, those of you who are conversant withsuch cases as I have seen, cases like those of Phulmoni Dossee, whichhas just now stirred your hearts to insist upon some change in theexisting law, and others where a life-long decrepitude has followed, towhich death itself were far preferable, do you not feel with me thatpenal servitude is not too hard a punishment for such brutality? I amglad to think that a very large section of Hindoo men think with me. Ihave been repeatedly spoken to on the subject, and members even of thosecastes which are most guilty in this matter, have expressed to me a wishthat Government would interfere and put a stop to the practice.Mrs.Pechey Phipson, M.D., _op. cit._A terrible evidence to the evil is borne by the following document:             [FROM THE TIMES OF INDIA, NOVEMBER 8TH, 1890.]      _To his Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India._  May it please Your Excellency.The undersigned ladies, practising  medicine in India, respectfully crave your Excellencys attention to  the following facts and considerations:  1. Your Excellency is aware that the present state of the Indian law  permits marriages to be consummated not only before the wife is  physically qualified for the duties of maternity, but before she is  able to perform the duties of the conjugal relation, thus giving rise  to numerous and great evils.  2. This marriage practice has become the cause of gross immoralities  and cruelties, which, owing to existing legislation, come practically  under the protection of the law. In some cases the law has permitted  homicide, and protected men, who, under other circumstances, would  have been criminally punished.  3. The institution of child-marriage rests upon public sentiment,  vitiated by degenerate religious customs and misinterpretation of  religious books. There are thousands among the better educated classes  who would rejoice if Government would take the initiative, and make  such a law as your memorialists plead for, and in the end the masses  would be grateful for their deliverance from the galling yoke that has  bound them to poverty, superstition, and the slavery of custom for  centuries.  4. The present system of child-marriage, in addition to the physical  and moral effects which the Indian Governments have deplored, produces  sterility, and consequently becomes an excuse for the introduction of  other child-wives into the family, thus becoming a justification for  _polygamy_.  5. This system panders to sensuality, lowers the standard of health  and morals, degrades the race, and tends to perpetuate itself and all  its attendant evils to future generations.  6. The lamentable case of the child-wife, Phulmani Dassi, of Calcutta,  which has excited the sympathy and the righteous indignation of the  Indian public, is only one of thousands of cases that are continually  happening, the final results being quite as horrible, but sometimes  less immediate. The following instances have come under the personal  observation of one or another of your Excellencys petitioners:  A. Aged 9. Day after marriage. Left _femur_ dislocated, _pelvis_    crushed out of shape, flesh hanging in shreds.  B. Aged 10. Unable to stand, bleeding profusely, flesh much lacerated.  C. Aged 9. So completely ravished as to be almost beyond surgical    repair. Her husband had two other living wives, and spoke very fine    English.  D. Aged 10. A very small child, and entirely undeveloped physically.    This child was bleeding to death from the _rectum_. Her husband was    a man of about 40 years of age, weighing not less than 11 stone. He    had accomplished his desire in an unnatural way.  E. Aged about 9. Lower limbs completely paralysed.  F. Aged about 12. Laceration of the _perineum_ extending through the    _sphincter ani_.  G. Aged about 10. Very weak from loss of blood. Stated that great    violence had been done her in an unnatural way.  H. Aged about 12. Pregnant, delivered by _craniotomy_ with great    difficulty, on account of the immature state of the _pelvis_ and    maternal passage.  I. Aged about 7. Living with husband. Died in great agony after three    days.  K. Aged about 10. Condition most pitiable. After one day in hospital    was demanded by her husband for his lawful use, he said.  L. Aged 11. From great violence done her person will be a cripple for    life. No use of her lower extremities.  M. Aged about 10. Crawled to hospital on her hands and knees. Has    never been able to stand erect since her marriage.  N. Aged 9. Dislocation of _pubic arch_, and unable to stand, or to put    one foot before the other.In view of the above facts, the undersigned lady doctors and medicalpractitioners appeal to your Excellencys compassion to enact orintroduce a measure by which the consummation of marriage will not bepermitted before the wife has attained the full age of fourteen (14)years. The undersigned venture to trust that the terrible urgency of thematter will be accepted as an excuse for this interruption of yourExcellencys time and attention.                                         (Signed by 55 lady-physicians.)The memorial as above was initiated by Mrs. Monelle Mansell, M.A., M.D.,who has been in practice in India for seventeen years, and it receivedthe signature of every other lady doctor there. The cases of abuse abovespecified are only a few out of many hundredsof cruel wrongs, deaths,and maimings for life received by helpless child-wives at the hands ofbrutal husbands, which have come under Dr. Monelle Mansells personalobservation, or that of her associates.With regard to case K, and lawful use, compare what is said by Dr.Emma B. Ryder, who is also in medical practice in India, concerning theLittle Wives of India:If I could take my readers with me on my roundof visits for one week, and let them behold the condition of the littlewives ... if you could see the suffering faces of the little girls, whoare drawn nearly double with contractions caused by the brutality oftheir husbands, and who will never be able to stand erect; if you couldsee the paralysed limbs that will not again move in obedience to thewill; if you could hear the plaintive wail of the little sufferers as,with their tiny hands clasped, they beg you to make them die, and thenturn and listen to the brutal remarks of the legal owner with regard tothe condition of his property. If you could stand with me by the side ofthe little deformed dead body, and, turning from the sickening sight,could be shown the new victim to whom the brute was already betrothed,do you think it would require long arguments to convince you that therewas a deadly wrong somewhere, and that someone was responsible for it?After one such scene a Hindoo husband said to me, You look like feelbad (meaning sad); doctors ought not to care what see. I dont carewhat see, nothing trouble me, only when self sick; I not like to havepain self.... A man may be a vile and loathsome creature, he may beblind, a lunatic, an idiot, a leper, or diseased in a worse form; he maybe fifty, seventy, or a hundred years old, and may be married to a babyor a girl of five or ten, who positively loathes his presence, but if heclaims her she must go, and the English law for the Restitution ofConjugal Rights compels her to remain in his power, or imprisons her ifshe refuses. There is no other form of slavery on the face of the earththat begins with the slavery as enforced upon these little girls ofIndia.(The Home-Maker, New York, June, 1891, quoted in the _Reviewof Reviews_, Vol. IV., p. 38.)And the _Times_ of 11th November, 1889, reported from its Calcuttacorrespondent:Two shocking cases of wife-killing lately came beforethe courtsin both cases the result of child-marriage. In one a childaged ten was strangled by her husband. In the second case a child of tenyears was ripped open with a wooden peg. Brutal sexual exasperation wasthe sole apparent reason in both instances. Compared with the terribleevils of child-marriage, widow cremation is of infinitely inferiormagnitude. The public conscience is continually being affronted withthese horrible atrocities, but, unfortunately, native public opiniongenerally seems to accept these revelations with complete apathy.For what slight legislative amendment has recently been effected in thegrievances mentioned by Dr. Ryder, see Note XXIV., 4. The Restitutionof Conjugal Rights, so justly condemned by her, does, indeed, appear tohave hadby some inadvertencea recognition in the Indian Courts whichwas not its lawful due. But for some fuller particulars on this matter,both as concerns India and England, see Note XXXVI., 6.                                 XXIII.            1._Action repeated tends to rhythmic course_.Other and wider muscular actions, partly internal and partly external,also take place in a rhythmical manner in relation with systemicconditions. The motions of the diaphragm and of the thoracic andabdominal walls, in connection with respiration, belong to thiscategory. These movements, though in the main independent of will, arecapable of being very considerably modified thereby, and while they aremost frequently unheeded, they have a very recognisable accompaniment offeeling when attention is distinctly turned to them.... The contractionof oviducts or of the womb, as well as the movements concerned inrespiration, also had their beginnings in forms of life whose advent isnow buried in the immeasurable past.Dr. H. C. Bastian (The Brain asan Organ of Mind, p. 220).                4._Till habit bred hereditary trace_.Let it be granted that the more frequently psychical states occur in acertain order, the stronger becomes their tendency to cohere in thatorder, until they at last become inseparable; let it be granted thatthis tendency is, in however slight a degree, inherited, so that if theexperiences remain the same, each successive generation bequeaths asomewhat increased tendency, and it follows that, in cases like the onedescribed, there must eventually result an automatic connection ofnervous actions, corresponding to the external relations perpetuallyexperienced. Similarly, if from some change in the environment of anyspecies its members are frequently brought in contact with a relationhaving terms a little more involved; if the organisation of the speciesis so far developed as to be impressible by these terms in closesuccession, then an inner relation corresponding to this new outerrelation will gradually be formed, and will, in the end, become organic.And so on in subsequent stages of progress.Herbert Spencer(Principles of Psychology, Vol. I., p. 439)._Id._... I have described the manner in which the hereditary tendenciesand instincts arise from habit, induced in the nervous cellules by asufficient repetition of the same acts.Letourneau (The Evolution ofMarriage, Chap. I.)._Id._...

Il y a eu des auteurs qui ne voulaient pas considrer lamenstruation comme une fonction inhrente  la nature de la femme, maiscomme une fonction acquise, continuant par lhabitude.Raciborski(Trait de la Menstruation, p. 17)._Id._... The set of mind, as Professor Tyndall well calls it,whether, as he says, impressed upon the molecules of the brain, orconveyed in any other way, is quite as much a human as an animalphenomenon. Perhaps the greater part of those qualities which we callthe characteristics of race are nothing else but the set of the mindsof men transmitted from generation to generation, stronger and moremarked when the deeds are repeated, weaker and fainter as they fall intodisuse.... Tyndall says: No mother can wash or suckle her baby withouthaving a set towards washing and suckling impressed upon the moleculesof her brain, and this set, according to the laws of hereditarytransmission, is passed on to her daughter. Not only, therefore, doesthe woman at the present day suffer deflection from intellectualpursuits through her proper motherly instincts, but inheritedproclivities act upon her mind like a multiplying galvanometer, toaugment indefinitely the amount of the deflection. _Tendency_ isimmanent even in spinsters, to warp them from intellect to baby-love.(Essay: Odds and Ends of Alpine Life.) Thus, if we could, by preachingour pet ideal, or in any other way induce one generation of women toturn to a new pursuit, we should have accomplished a step towardsbending all future womanhood in the same direction.Frances Power Cobbe(Essay: The Final Cause of Woman).See also Note XXVI., 7.                     6.... _een the virgin_ ...An experienced gyncologist writes:For want of proper information inthis matter, many a frightened girl has resorted to every conceivabledevice to check what she supposed to be an unnatural and dangeroushmorrhage, and thereby inaugurated menstrual derangements which haveprematurely terminated her life, or enfeebled her womanhood. I have beenconsulted by women of all ages, who frankly attributed their physicalinfirmities to the fact of their having applied ice, or made other coldapplications locally, in their frantic endeavours to arrest the firstmenstrual flow.What general practitioner has not met with analogous instances in thecircle of his own patients?                         7.... _ere fit_ ...The physician, whose duty is not only to heal the sick, but also toprevent disease and to improve the race, and hence who must be a teacherof men and women, should teach sound doctrine in regard to the injuriousresults of precocious marriage. Mothers especially ought to be taught,though some have learned the lesson by their own sad experience, thatpuberty and nubility are not equivalent terms, but stand for periods oflife usually separated by some years; the one indicates capability, theother fitness, for reproduction.Parvin (Obstetrics, p. 91)._Id._... _The general maturity of the whole frame_ is the trueindication that the individual, whether male or female, has reached afit age to reproduce the species. It is not one small and unimportantsymptom by which this question must be judged. Many things go to make upvirility in man; the beard, the male voice, the change in figure, andthe change in disposition; and in girls there is a long period ofdevelopment in the bust, in the hips, in bone and muscle, changes whichtake years for their proper accomplishment before the girl can be saidto have grown into a woman. All this is not as a rule completed beforethe age of twenty. Womans form is not well developed before she istwenty years old; her pelvis, which has been called the laboratory ofgeneration, has not its perfect shape until then; hence an earliermaternity is not desirable. If the demand is made on the system beforethat, the process of development is necessarily interfered with, andboth mother and offspring suffer. Even in countries where the age ofmarriage is between twenty and twenty-five, where, therefore, the motherhas not been weakened by early maternity, it is remarked that thestrongest children are born to parents of middle age, _i.e._, fromthirty-five to forty; this, the prime of life to the parent, is thehappiest moment for the advent of her progeny.Mrs. Pechey Phipson,M.D. (Address to the Hindoos).See also end of Note XXIV., 1.                  8._Abnormal fruits of birth_ ...Dr. John Thorburn, in his Lecture introductory to the Summer Course onObstetric Medicine, Victoria University, Manchester, 1884, says:Letme briefly remind you of what occurs at each menstrual period. Duringnearly one week out of every four there occurs the characteristicphenomenon of menstruation, which in itself has some temporary_impoverishing effect_, though, in health, nature speedily provides themeans of recuperation. Along with this we have a marked disturbance inthe circulation of the pelvis, leading to alterations in the weight,conformation, and position of the _uterus_. We have also tissue changesoccurring, _not perhaps yet thoroughly understood_, but leading toruptures in the ovary, and to exfoliation of the uterine liningmembrane, _a kind of modified abortion, in fact_. These changes in mostinstances are accompanied by signs of pain and discomfort, which, ifthey were not periodic and physiological, would be considered assymptoms of disease.(The italics are not in the original.) Here is certainly cogent evidenceof abnormal fruit of birth, and the learned doctor seems to be on theverge of making the involuntary discovery. But he follows the usualprofessional attempt (see Note XXX., 4) to class menstruation as aphysiological and not a pathological fact; as a natural, painfulincident, and not an acquired painful consequence. His half-declaredargument, that, because an epoch of pain is periodic it is therefore notsymptomatic of disease, is a theory as unsatisfactory as novel._Id._... Some of the facts connected with parthenogenesis, alternategeneration, the impregnation of insects, &c., passed on through morethan one generation, would show by analogy this class of phenomena notextranatural or unprecedented, but abnormal and capable of rectificationor reduction to pristine normality or non-existence. The fact ofoccasional instances of absence of menstruation, yet with a perfectpotentiality of child-bearing, indicates this latter possibility. Thatthe male being did not correspondingly suffer in personal physiologicalsequence is explicable on the ground that the masculine bodily functionof parentage cannot be subjected to equal forced sexual abuse; though inthe male sex also there is indication that excess may leave hereditaryfunctional trace. And that, again, a somewhat analogous physicalabnormality may be induced by man in other animals, compare theintelligent words of George Eliot in her poem, A Minor Prophet:                ... milkmaids who drew milk from cows,                With udders kept abnormal for that end.In confirmation of which see Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr.E. Bidwell, Professor Boyd Dawkins, and others, appointed for thepurpose of preparing a Report on the Herds of Wild Cattle in ChartleyPark, and other parks in Great Britain. The Committee state, concerninga herd of wild cattle at Somerford Park, near Congleton, of which herdthe cows are all regularly milked, that The udders of the cows hereare as large as in ordinary domestic cows, which is not the case in theherds which are not milked.(Report of the British Association, 1887,p. 141.)                                 XXIV.                       1._Misread by man_ ...You say We marry our girls when they reach puberty, and you take asindication of that stage one only, and that the least certain, of themany changes which go to make up maturity. It is the least certainbecause the most variable, and dependent more upon climate andconditions of life than upon any true physical development. No one woulddeny that a strong country girl of thirteen was more mature physicallythan a girl of eleven brought up in the close, unwholesome atmosphere ofa crowded city, yet you say the latter has attained to puberty, and thatthe former has not. Into such discrepancies has this physiological errorled you. Without going into the domain of physiology for proof ofassertion, let me draw your attention to the very practical proof of itstruth, which you have in the fact well-known to you all, that girlsmarried at this so-called period of puberty do not, as a rule, bearchildren till some years later, _i.e._, till they really approachmaturity. I allow that you share this error with all but modernphysiologists. Even if marriage is delayed till fourteen, whereconception takes place immediately, sterility follows after; but wherethe girl is strong and healthy there is a lapse of three or four yearsbefore child-bearing begins, a proof that puberty had not been reachedtill then, although menstruation had been all the time existent. Ofcourse there are exceptional cases, but does not the consensus ofexperience point to these as general truths?Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D.(Address to Hindoos)._Id._ ... _sign of his misdeed_.See Note XXVI., 6.                  4.... _victim to his adult rage_.Of this, as existent to the present age, abundant direct and collateralevidence is given by a _brochure_ entitled A Practical View of the Ageof Consent Act, for the benefit of the Mahomedan community in general,by the Committee of the Mahomedan Literary Society of Calcutta,published by that Society, in June, 1891, as an accurate exposition ofthe object and scope of the new law, in the clearest possible language,for the benefit of the Mahomedans, particularly the ignorant classes,and circulated widely in the vernacular languages for that purpose.The following are extracts from the pamphlet:  Par. 1. Now that the Age of Consent Act has been passed by his  Excellency the Viceroy, in Council, and as there is every likelihood  of its provisions not being sufficiently well understood by the  Mahomedan community in general, and by the ignorant Mahomedans in  particular, owing to the use of technical legal phraseology in the  drafting of the Act, it seems to the Committee of Management of the  Mahomedan Literary Society of Calcutta, to be highly desirable that  the object and intention of the Government in passing this Act, as  well as its scope and the manner in which it is to be administered by  the Criminal Authorities, should be laid down on paper in the clearest  and easiest language possible, for the information and instruction of  the Mahomedan population, and particularly of such of them as are not  conversant with legal technicalities.  Par. 2. The Committee are of opinion that such a course will be  highly beneficial to members of their community, inasmuch as it will  show to them distinctly what action on the part of a Mahomedan husband  towards his young wife has been made, by the recent legislation, a  heinous criminal offence of no less enormity than the offence of  _rape_, and punishable with the same heavy punishment.  Par. 3. It is hoped that they will thereby be put on their guard  against committing, or allowing the commission of an act which _they  have hitherto been accustomed to think lawful and innocent_, but which  has now been made into a heinous offence....  Par. 9. ... There has already been a provision in the Indian Penal  Code, passed more than thirty years ago, that a man having sexual  intercourse with his own wife, with or without her consent, she _being  under the age of ten years_, shall be considered guilty of the offence  of _rape_, and shall be liable to transportation for life, or to  rigorous or simple imprisonment for ten years.  Par. 10. From this it follows that, under the Penal Code a man having  sexual intercourse with his own wife, with or without her consent, if  she is _above ten_ years of age, shall not be considered to have  committed the offence of _rape_. But the Act that has just been  passed, in amendment of the above provision in the Penal Code,  _raises_ the age of consent from _ten_ to _twelve_ years, and provides  that a man having sexual intercourse with his own wife, even with her  consent, shall be considered to be guilty of the offence of rape, if  the wife be of any age under _twelve completed years_. This is all the  change that has been made in the law.  Par. 11. It having been ascertained, from various sources, that in  some parts of the country husbands cohabit with their wives before  they have attained to the age of _twelve_ years, and even before they  have arrived at _puberty_, the result of such intercourse being in  many cases to cause injury to the health, and even danger to the life  of the girls, and to generate internal maladies which make them  miserable throughout their lives, and such a state of things having  come to the notice of Government, they have considered it their duty  to put a stop to it, and this is the object of the present  legislation.  Par. 12. The law does not interfere with the age at which a girl may  be married, but simply prohibits sexual intercourse with her by her  husband before she is _twelve_ years of age.  Par. 13. It is therefore _incumbent_ upon all husbands and their  guardians (if they are very young and inexperienced lads) to be very  careful that sexual intercourse does not take place until the  girl-wife has _passed_ the age of _twelve_ years. It will also be the  duty of the guardians of the girl-wife not to allow her husband to  cohabit with her until she has attained that age.  Par. 17. ... The Mahomedan law (_i.e._, religious law) distinctly  sanctions consummation of marriage _only_ when the wife has reached  puberty, and has besides attained such physical development as renders  her fit for sexual intercourse, and it is _not imperative_ upon a  Mahomedan husband to consummate marriage with his wife when she is  _under_ the age of _twelve_ years. Even in those rare cases in which  the wife attains to puberty and the necessary physical development  before the age of _twelve_, a Mahomedan husband _may_, without  infringing any canon of the Mahommedan Ecclesiastical Law, _abstain_  from consummating his marriage with her _until_ she attains that age.  Par. 18. The above will clearly show that the Act recently passed by  the Legislature does not, in any way, interfere with the Mahomedan  religion, and _no_ Mahomedan husband will be considered to have  committed a sin if he abstains from consummating marriage with his  wife _before_ she is _twelve_ years of age.(The pamphlet is published, as aforesaid, by the Mahomedan LiterarySociety of Calcutta, of which the patron is the Hon. Sir Charles A.Elliott, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., and the president Prince Mirza Jahan KadarBahadur (of the Oudh family), and is signed by the secretary, NawabAbdool Luteef Bahadur, C.I.E.; Calcutta, 16 Taltollah, 22nd June, 1891.)The italics, as above, exist in the original (with the exception ofthose in Par. 3), and serve, singularly enough, to point for us a moralvery much deeper than that intended. It is a happy fact that Britishfeeling, supported by the growing sentiment of the more intelligent andeducated of the native population, has effected even so slight anamelioration of law and custom, and we may hope for and press forward tofurther improvement. Though the utterance quoted above is only that ofthe Mahomedan section, it is, of course, understood that the law doesnot apply or point to them alone, but to all the peoples and sects ofIndia; and that the approval of this legislation is also general amongthe enlightened of those other creeds. (See end of Note XVII., 8.)Singular confirmatory evidence as to the distressing prevalence of thischild-marriage is incidentally given in the following paragraph from the_Times_ of 31st March, 1892:  A correspondent of the _Times of India_ mentions some odd instances  of minor difficulties which have occurred in the working of the  amended Factory Act, which came into force in India at the  commencement of the present year. The limit of age for full-timers  in factories is fixed at fourteen years, and as very few native  operatives know their childrens ages, or even their own, the medical  officer has, in passing lads and girls for work, to judge the age as  best he cangenerally, as in the case of horses, by examining their  teeth. If he concludes that they are under fourteen, he reduces them  to half-timers. In one Bombay mill recently a number of girls were  thus sent back as under age who were actually mothers, and several  boys who were fathers were also reduced; and one of the latter was the  father, it is said, of three children. The case of these lads is  particularly hard, for, with a wife and child, or perhaps children, to  support, life, on the pay of a half-timer, must be a terrible  struggle.Lest it should be objected that such abuseswith their consequencesashave been instanced in India, are peculiar to that country orcivilisation, and that their discussion has therefore no bearing on ourpractices in England, and the physical consequences ensuant here, itwill be salutary to recall what has been our own national conduct inthis matter of enforcement of immature physical relations on girlchildren or wives within times of by no means distant date. Blackstonetells in his Commentaries, Book II., Chap. VIII., that The wife mustbe above nine years old at her husbands death, otherwise she shall notbe endowed, though in Bractons time the age was indefinite, and dowerwas then only due si uxor possit dotem promereri, _et virumsustinere_. Whereupon Ed. Christian makes the following note, worthyof the most careful meditation:Lord Coke informs us that if the wifebe past the age of nine years at the time of her husbands death, sheshall be endowed, of what age soever her husband be, albeit he were but_four_ years old. Quia junior non potest dotem promereri, _et virumsustinere_. (Coke on Litt., 33.) This we are told by that grave andreverend judge without any remark of surprise or reprobation. But itconfirms the observation of Montesquieu in the Spirit of Laws, BookXXVI., Chap. III. There has been, says he, much talk of a law inEngland which permitted girls seven years old to choose a husband. Thislaw was shocking two ways; it had no regard to the time when Naturegives maturity to the understanding, nor to the time when she givesmaturity to the body. It is abundantly clear, both from our law andhistory, that formerly such early marriages were contracted as in thepresent times are neither attempted nor thought of.This was probably owing to the right which the lord possessed ofputting up to sale the marriage of his infant tenant. He no doubt tookthe first opportunity of prostituting (_i.e._, selling in marriage) theinfant to his own interest, without any regard to age or inclinations.And thus what was so frequently practised and permitted by the law wouldcease even in other instances to be considered with abhorrence. _If themarriage of a female was delayed till she was sixteen, this benefit wasentirely lost to the lord her guardian._Even the 18 Eliz., cap. 7, which makes it a capital crime to abuse aconsenting female child under the age of ten years, seems to leave anexception for these marriages by declaring only the _carnal andunlawful_ knowledge of such woman-child to be a felony. Hence theabolition of the feudal wardships and marriage at the Restoration mayperhaps have contributed not less to the improvement of the morals thanof the liberty of the people.(Blackstones Comm., Christians Edition,1830, Vol. II., p. 131.)                         6.... _manner_ ...Manner, or custom is the early Biblical definition for this habit(_vide_ Gen. xviii. 11, and xxxi. 35). It may be noticed that the wordis not rendered or translated as nature. It is also called sickness(Lev. xx. 18); and pollution (Ezek. xxii. 10). See also Note XXV. 8.The authorised version of the Bible is here referred to. The euphemismsattempted in the recent revised version as amendments of some of thesepassages are equally consonant with the argument of this note.                                  XXV.                    1._Vicarious punishment_ ...Revolting was the shock to the writer, coming, some years ago, withunprejudiced and ingenuous mind, to the study of the so-called Diseasesof Women, on finding that nearly the whole of these special diseases,including menstruation, were due, directly or collaterally, to one formor other of _masculine_ excess or abuse. Here is a nearly coincidentopinion, afterwards met with:The diseases peculiar to women are somany, of so frequent occurrence, and of such severity, that half thetime of the medical profession is devoted to their care, and more thanhalf its revenues depend upon them. We have libraries of books uponthem, special professorships in our medical colleges, and hosts ofdoctors who give them their exclusive attention.... The books andprofessors are all at fault. They have no knowledge of the causes ornature of these diseases (or at least they do not publish it, or act onit), and no idea of their proper treatment. Women are everywhereoutraged and abused. When the full chapter of womans wrongs andsufferings is written, the world will be horrified at the hideousspectacle....T. L. Nichols, M.D. (Esoteric Anthropology, p. 198).So, again, in speaking of menorrhagia:The causes of this disease,whatever they are, must be removed. Thousands of women are consigned topremature graves; some by the morbid excesses of their own passions, butfar more by the sensual and selfish indulgences of those who claim thelegal right to murder them in this manner, whom no law of homicide canreach, and upon whose victims no coroner holds an inquest.(_Op. cit._,p. 301.)                      2.... _grievous toll_ ...And this in every grade of society, even to the pecuniary loss, as wellas discomfort, of the labouring classes of women.Statistics of sickness in the Post Office show that women (these areunmarried women) are away from their work more days than men.(SidneyWebb, at British Association, 1891.)                      5.... _no honest claim_.The _Times_ of Aug. 3, 1892, reports a paper by Professor Lombroso, ofTurin (at the International Congress of Psychology, London), in whichoccurs the following:It must be observed that woman was exposed tomore pains than man, because man imposed submission and often evenslavery upon her. As a girl, she had to undergo the tyranny of herbrothers, and the cruel preferences accorded by parents to their malechildren. Woman was the slave of her husband, and still more of socialprejudices.... Let them not forget the physical disadvantage under whichshe had to labour. She might justly call herself the pariah of the humanfamily.The word is apt and corroborative, for it was no honest actit was notNature, but human cruelty and injustice that formed a pariah.                     8.... _opprobrious theme_._Conf._ ancient and medival superstitions and accusations on thesubject. Raciborski notes these aspersions (Trait, p. 13):Plineprtendait que les femmes tant au moment des rgles pouvaient desscherles arbres par de simples attouchements, faire prir des fruits, &c.,&c. And a further writer says more fully:Pliny informs us that thepresence of a menstrual woman turns wine sour, causes trees to shedtheir fruit, parches up their young fruit, and makes them for everbarren, dims the splendour of mirrors and the polish of ivory, turns theedge of sharpened iron, converts brass into rust, and is the cause ofcanine rabies. In Isaiah xxx. 22, the writer speaks of the defilement ofgraven images, which shall be cast away as a menstruous cloth; and inEzekiel xviii. 6, and xxxvi. 17, allusions of the same import are made.Unless we accept the antiquated notion of a special curse on women,how reconcile the idea of an ordinance of Nature being so repulsivelyand opprobriously alluded to? Well may it be said:Ingratitude is ahateful vice. Not only the defects, but even the illnesses which havetheir source in the excessive (man-caused) susceptibility of woman,are often made by men an endless subject of false accusations andpitiless reproaches.(M. le Docteur Cerise, in his Introduction toRoussel, p. 34.)                                 XXVI.       1._Thoughts like to these are breathings of the truth_.I submit that there is a spiritual, a poetic, and, for aught we know, aspontaneous and uncaused element in the human mind, which ever and anonsuddenly, and without warning, gives us a glimpse and a forecast of thefuture, and urges us to seize truth, as it were, by anticipation. Inattacking the fortress we may sometimes storm the citadel withoutstopping to sap the outworks. That great discoveries have been made inthis way the history of our knowledge decisively proves.H. T. Buckle(Influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge)._Id._... Then there is the inner consciousnessthe psychethat hasnever yet been brought to bear upon life and its questions. Besideswhich, there is a supersensuous reason. Observation is perhaps morepowerful an organon than either experiment or empiricism. If the eye isalways watching, and the mind on the alert, ultimately chance suppliesthe solution.Jefferies (The Story of My Heart, Chap. X.)._Id._... Women only want hints, finger-boards, and finding these, willfollow them to Nature. The quick-glancing intellect will gather up, asit moves over the ground, the almost invisible ends and threads ofthought, so that a single volume may convey to the mind of woman truthswhich man would require to have elaborated in four or six.Eliza W.Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 420).                  3.... _futile mannish pleas_ ...Roussel details fully some nine of these main theories or explanationsof the habitude. (Systme, Note A.)                      6._In blindness born_ ...Tous ces faits nous induisent fortement  conjecturer quil a dexister un temps ou les femmes ntaient point assujettis  ce tributincommode; que le flux menstruel bien loin dtre une institutionnaturelle, est au contraire un besoin factice contract dans ltatsociale.Roussel (_Op. cit._, Chap. II.).Note that menstruation (scriptural sickness) remains a pathologicalincident, not, as child-birth, an indubitably natural and normalphysical function.See also Note XXX., 4._Id._... _in error fostered_ ...Not only the habit itself, but its causes. And this by medical, _i.e._,assumedly curative, practitioners. As to which fostering, medical andclinical manuals afford abundant spontaneous and ingenuous testimony,and also of other professional practices of instigation, or condonation,or complicity, at which a future age will look aghast. _Conf._ thefollowing from Whitehead, On the Causes and Treatment of Abortion andSterility (Churchill, 1847):  In a case under my care of pregnancy in a woman, with _extreme  deformity of the pelvis_, wherein it was considered advisable to  _procure abortion_ in the fifth month of the process, the ergot alone  was employed, and, at first, with the desired effect. [The italics  are not in the doctors book; he remarks nothing wrong or immoral,  andin an unprofessional personillegal, and open to severest penalty;  he is simply detailing the effects of a specified medicament.] It was  given in _three successive_ pregnancies, and in each instance labour  pains came on after eight or ten doses had been administered, and  expulsion was effected by the end of the third day. It was  perseveringly tried in a fourth pregnancy in the same individual, and  failed completely (p. 254).There is an ominous silence as to whether the patients health or lifealso failed completely.See further a case noted on p. 264, _op. cit._:        1st child, still-born, in eighth month, April 1832.        2nd child, abortion at end of 6th month.        3rd child, abortion at end of 6th month.        4th child, abortion at end of 5th month.        5th child, abortion soon after quickening, Summer, 1838.        6th child, still-born, 7th October, 1839.        7th child, no clear record given.Also other somewhat parallel cases given, the constant incidentalaccompaniment being painful physical suffering and grave inconvenience,frequently with fatal results. Medical records are full of similarhistories. To the unsophisticated mind, two questions sternly suggestthemselves: Firstly, Is it meet or right for an honourable profession,or any individual member of it, to be _particeps criminis_ in suchproceedings as the above? and, secondly, is the indicated connubialmorality on any higher level, or likely to be attended with any betterconsequences, than the prior ignorant or savage abuses which areresponsible for womans present physical condition?The advocacy of cardinal reform in this directionin the wrong done bothto the individual and the raceis urgent part of the duty of ournewly-taught medical women. Nor are their eyes closed nor their mouthsdumb in the matter. Dr. Caroline B. Winslow is quoted by the _WomansJournal_ of Boston, U.S., 16th Jan., 1892, as saying in an article onThe Right to be Well Born: What higher motive can a man have in lifethan to labour steadily to prepare the way for the coming of a higher,better humanity?... Dense ignorance prevails in our profession, and isreflected by laymen. All their scientific studies and years of medicalpractice have failed to convict men of the wrongs and outrages done towomen; wrongs that no divine laws sanction, and no legal enactments canavert....The physician is a witness of the modern death-struggles and horrors ofmaternity; he sees lives pass out of his sight; he makes vain attemptsto restore broken constitutions, broken by violating divine laws thatgovern organic matter: laws that are obeyed by all animal instinct; yetall this knowledge, observation, and experience have failed to reveal tothe benighted intellect and obtuse moral sense of the ordinarypractitioner this great wrong. He makes no note of the unhallowed abusethat only man dares; neither will he mark the disastrous anddeteriorating effect of this waste of vital force on his own offspring.The mental, moral, and physical imperfections of the rising generationare largely the result of outraged motherhood.                7._The spurious function growing_ ...Mr. Francis Darwin, in a paper on Growth Curvatures in Plants, says ofthe biologist, Sachs, who had made researches in the same phenomena: Hespeaks, too, of _custom_ or _use_, _building up_ the specialisedinstinct for certain curvatures. (Sachs Arbeiten, 1879.) These areexpressions consistent with our present views.(Presidential Address tothe Biological Section of the British Association, 1891.)In the same section was also read a paper by Francis Darwin and DorotheaF. N. Pertz, On the _Artificial_ Production of Rhythm in Plants, inwhich were detailed results very apposite to this growing of a spuriousfunction.         8.... _almost natural use the morbid mode appears_.So true is it that unnatural generally only means uncustomary, and thateverything which is usual appears natural.J. S. Mill (The Subjectionof Women, p. 22).                                 XXVII.                      1._Grievous the hurt_ ...Buckle notes one of the many incidental evil results in his CommonPlace Book, Art. 2133:It has been remarked that in our climate women are more frequentlyaffected with insanity than men, and it has been considered veryunfavourable to recovery if they should be worse at the time ofmenstruation, or have their catamenia in very small or immoderatequantities. (Paris and Fonblanques Medical Jurisprudence, Vol. I.,p. 327).               5.... _reintegrate in frame and mind_.Thus then you have first to mould her physical frame, and then, as thestrength she gains will permit you, to fill and temper her mind with allknowledge and thoughts which tend to confirm its natural instincts ofjustice, and refine its natural tact of love.John Ruskin (Of QueensGardens, p. 154).                                XXVIII.             5, 6.... _given in our hand,                    Is power the evil hazard to command_.That which is thoughtlessly credited to a non-existent intelligenceshould really be claimed and exercised by the human race. It isourselves who should direct our affairs, protecting ourselves from pain,assisting ourselves, succouring and rendering our lives happy. We mustdo for ourselves what superstition has hitherto supposed an intelligenceto do for us.... These things speak with a voice of thunder. From everyhuman being whose body has been racked with pain; from every human beingwho has suffered from accident or disease; from every human beingdrowned, burned, or slain by negligence, there goes up a continuallyincreasing cry louder than the thunder. An awe-inspiring cry dread tolisten to, against which ears are stopped by the wax of superstition andthe wax of criminal selfishness. These miseries are your doing, becauseyou have mind and thought and could have prevented them. You can preventthem in the future. You do not even try.R. Jefferies (The Story of MyHeart, pp. 149 _et seq._)._Id._... From one philosophical point of view, that of Du Prel, theexperiments are already regarded as proving that the soul is anorganising as well as a thinking power.... Bernheim saw an apoplecticparalysis rapidly improved by suggestion.... The more easily an idea canbe established in the subject, the quicker a therapeutic result can beinduced.... I think that hardly any of the newest discoveries are soimportant to the art of healing, apart from surgery, as the study ofsuggestion.... Now that it has been proved that even organic changes canbe caused by suggestion, we are obliged to ascribe a much greaterimportance to mental influences than we have hitherto done.Dr. AlbertMoll (Hypnotism, pp. 122, 318, 320, 325, 327)._Id._... It would, I fancy, have fared but ill with one who, standingwhere I now stand, in what was then a thickly-peopled and fashionablepart of London, should have broached to our ancestors the doctrine whichI now propound to youthat all their hypotheses were alike wrong; thatthe plague was no more, in their sense, Divine judgment, than the firewas the work of any political, or of any religious, sect; but that theywere themselves the authors of both plague and fire, and that they mustlook to themselves to prevent the recurrence of calamities, to allappearance so peculiarly beyond the reach of human control.... We, inlater times, have learned somewhat of Nature, and partly obey her.Because of this partial improvement of our natural knowledge and of thatfractional obedience, we have no plague; because that knowledge is stillvery imperfect and that obedience yet incomplete, typhus is ourcompanion and cholera our visitor. But it is not presumptuous to expressthe belief that, when our knowledge is more complete and our obediencethe expression of our knowledge, London will count her centuries offreedom from typhus and cholera as she now gratefully reckons her twohundred years of ignorance of that plague which swooped upon her thricein the first half of the seventeenth century.T. H. Huxley (OnImproving Natural Knowledge).And the pestilent malady from which woman specially still suffers is asdefinitely the result of mans ignorant or thoughtless misdoing, and isas indubitably amenable to rectification, as the plague of the bye-goneages, or the typhus and cholera of the present.            8.... _pain both prompts and points escape_.All evil is associated more or less closely with pain ... and pain ofevery kind is so repugnant to the human organism, that it is no soonerfelt than an effort is made to escape from it.... Alongside of theevolution of evil there has ever been a tendency towards the_elimination_ of evil.... The highest intellectual powers of thegreatest men have for their ultimate object the mitigation of evil, andthe final elimination of it from the earth.Richard Bithell (The Creedof a Modern Agnostic, p. 103).

Onlywoman is sufficient to state womans claims and vindicate them.ElizaW.

This assertion I venture mostemphatically to deny. The actual period of child-birth apart, theordinarily healthy woman is as fit for work every day of her life as theordinarily healthy man. Fresh air, exercise, suitable clothing andnourishing food, added to the habitual temperance of women in eating anddrinking, have brought about a marvellously good result in improvingtheir average health.Mrs. Fawcett (_Fortnightly Review_, Nov. 1891).(See also Note LX., 8.)                   8._The sage physician, she_ ...Not only sage physician, but brave physician; for brave indeed hasbeen the part she has had to bear against male professional prejudiceand jealousy, opposition from masculine vested interests, virulent abuseand even personal violence. So recently as 1888, Dr. Sophia Jex-Blakehas to report concerning the medical education of women, that:  The first difficulty lies in some remaining jealousy and ill-will  towards medical women on the part of a section (constantly  diminishing, as I believe) of the medical profession itself. Some  twenty years ago the professional prejudice was so deep and so widely  spread that it constituted a very formidable obstacle, but it has been  steadily melting away before the logic of facts; and now is, with a  few exceptions, rarely to be found among the leaders of the  profession, nor indeed among the great majority of the rank and file,  as far as can be judged by the personal experience of medical women  themselves. Unfortunately, it seems strongest just where it has least  justification, viz., among the practitioners who devote themselves  chiefly to midwifery, and to the special diseases of women. The  Obstetrical Society is, so far as I know, still of the same mind as  when, in 1874, they excluded Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, a  distinguished M.D. of Paris, from their membership; and the Soho  Square Hospital for Women has never revoked its curt refusal to allow  me to enter its doors, when, in 1878, I proposed to take advantage of  the invitation issued in its report to all practitioners who were  specially interested in the cases for which the hospital is reserved.  Sometimes this jealousy takes a sufficiently comic form. For instance,  I received for two successive years a lithographed circular inviting  me by name to send to the _Lancet_ the reports of interesting cases  that might occur in my dispensary practice, but when I wrote in  response to this supposed offer of professional fellowship, I received  by next post a hurried assurance from the editor that it was all a  mistake, and that, in fact, the _Lancet_ could not stoop to record  medical experiences, however interesting, if they occurred in the  practice of the inferior sex! Probably it will not require many more  years to make this sort of thing ridiculous, even in the eyes of those  who are now capable of such puerilities.  The second obstacle lies in the continued exclusion of women from the  majority of our Universities, and from the English Colleges of  Physicians and Surgeons. Here also the matter may be left to the  growth of public opinion as regards those existing bodies which do not  depend upon the public purse; but it is time that Parliament should  refuse supplies to those bodies whose sense of justice cannot be  otherwise awakened, and it is certainly the duty of Government to see  that no new charter is granted without absolute security for equal  justice to students of both sexes.Sophia Jex-Blake, M.D.  (_Nineteenth Century_, Nov., 1887).See also Note LVII., 1, and LVIII, 1._Id._... Progress is indeed being made, surely, yet slowly, for Mrs.Fawcett has still necessity to reiterate, four years afterwards:Make her a doctor, put her through the mental discipline and thephysical toil of the profession; charge her, as doctors are so oftencharged, with the health of mind and body of scores of patients, sheremains womanly to her finger tips, and a good doctor in proportion asthe truly womanly qualities in her are strongly developed. Poor womenare very quick to find this out as patients. Not only from the immediateneighbourhood of the New Hospital for Women, where all the staff arewomen doctors, but also from the far East of London do they come,because the ladies, as they call them, are ladies, and show their poorpatients womanly sympathy, gentleness, and patience, womanly insight andthoughtfulness in little things, and consideration for their hometroubles and necessities. It is not too much to say that a woman cannever hope to be a good doctor unless she is truly and really a womanlywoman. And much the same thing may be said with regard to fields ofactivity not yet open to women.Mrs. Fawcett (_Fortnightly Review_,Nov., 1891)._Id._... _saviour of her sex_.Bebel says:Women doctors would be the greatest blessing to their ownsex. The fact that women must place themselves in the hands of men incases of illness or of the physical disturbances connected with theirsexual functions frequently prevents their seeking medical help in time.This gives rise to numerous evils, not only for women, but also for men.Every doctor complains of this reserve on the part of women, whichsometimes becomes almost criminal, and of their dislike to speak freelyof their ailments, even after they have made up their minds to consult adoctor. This is perfectly natural, the only irrational thing about it isthe refusal of men, and especially of doctors, to recognise howlegitimate the study of medicine is for women. (Woman, Waltherstranslation, p. 131.)_Id._... As I am alluding to my own experience in this matter, I mayperhaps be allowed to say how often in the same place I have been struckwith the _contingent_ advantages attendant on the medical care by womenof women; how often I have seen cases connected with stories of shame orsorrow to which a womans hand could far more fittingly minister, andwhere sisterly help and counsel could give far more appropriate succourthan could be expected from the average young medical man, however goodhis intentions. Perhaps we shall find the solution of some of oursaddest social problems, when educated and pure-minded women are broughtmore constantly in contact with their sinning and suffering sisters, inother relations as well as those of missionary effort.Dr. SophiaJex-Blake (Essay: Medicine as a Profession for Women).                                  XXX.                      1._With purer phase_ ...A noted specialist in this matter, Dr. Tilt, basing his conclusions onhis own unpublished observations, and on those already made public by M.Brierre de Boismont and Dr. Rawn, has declared what is indeed agenerally accepted proposition, that luxurious living and habits rendermenstruation precarious, while this function is retarded by out-doorlabour and less sophisticated habits. (Proceedings of BritishAssociation, 1850, p. 135; On the Causes which Advance or Retard theAppearance of First Menstruation in Women, by E. J. Tilt, M.D., &c.,&c.)                        4.... _weakness_ ...It is to be carefully kept in mind that this weakness (Scriptural,sickness, Lev. xx., 18) is strictly a pathological incident; whilematernity is truly a physiological one; the male false physicists seemin their mental and clinical attitude to have aimed to precisely reversethis definition. (See also Note XXIII., 8, and XXVI., 6.)5, 6.To the fact related in these two lines there is testimony innearly every book connected with the subject; and doubtless numerousinstances never come to light, owing to the very natural reticencepointed out in Note XXIX., 8. The improved condition reported by Mrs.Fawcett (Note XXIX., 6) is hence more readily verified by womenpractitioners; and the writer has had detailed personal experiences ofperfect health and maternity being co-existent with little or noappearance of the menses in the case of women whose names, if published,would be indubitable guarantee for their accuracy and veracity.            7._Not to neglectful man to greatly care_ ...The Report of the British Association for 1850, in summarising the paperabove referred to (Note 1), says of Dr. Tilt that, in discussing whathe calls the intrinsic causes which have been supposed to influencemenstruation, his observations are rather of a suggestive character, forhe considers such causes highly problematical and requiring furtherinvestigation. Dr. Tilt rightly emphasises the question as a matterequally interesting to the physician, the philosopher, and thestatesman; and it behoves them to know that this epoch (of menstruation)varies under the influence of causes which for the most part have beeninsufficiently studied. But the negligence or carelessness reprobatedin the verse has again supervened.Buckle says, concerning this same paper of Dr. Tilts: We take shame toourselves for not having sooner noticed this very interesting and insome respects very important work; the author unknown, (?) and yet thebook has gone through two editions, though written on a subjectignorantly supposed to be going on well. That women can be satisfiedwith their state shows their deterioration. That they can be satisfiedwith knowing nothing, &c. (_sic._) (Miscellaneous and PosthumousWorks, Vol. I., p. 381.)The whole passage seems somewhat incoherent, and is unfinished as above,as if left by Mr. Buckle for further consideration. The last two remarksas to women are certainly not written with his usual justice; when weremember how assiduously men have striven to prevent womans pursuit ofphysiological knowledge, especially as applied to her own person, it ismanifest that the blame for womans ignorance, or her presumedsatisfaction therewith, is more fittingly to be reproached to man thanto her.                                 XXXI.                     1._Her intellect alert_ ..._Intellectus prelucit voluntati._Intellect carries the light beforethe will.Cardinal Manning (_Review of Reviews_, Vol. V., p. 135).          5, 6.... _body still is supple unto mind,                  By dint of soul is fleshly form inclined_.Reflecting Platos teaching, our second worthy Elizabethan poet hassaid:               Every spirit as it is most pure,               And hath in it the more of heavenly light,               So it the fairer body doth procure               To habit in.               For of the Soul the Body form doth take:               For Soul is form, and doth the Body make.And in our own day, Charles Kingsley says, in serious sportiveness: Theone true doctrine of this wonderful fairy tale is, that your soul makesyour body, just as a snail makes its shell. And again: You must knowand believe that peoples souls make their bodies just as a snail makesits shell.... I am not joking, my little man; I am in serious, solemnearnest.(The Water Babies, Chaps. III. and IV.)And Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Aurora Leigh, Book III.)           ... the soul           Which grows within a child makes the child grow.The physiologists and psychologists, as is not unusual, tardily followin the wake of the poets. At the International Congress of ExperimentalPsychology, London, 1892, Professor Delbuf said that at all times themind of man had been capable of influencing the body, but it was only inrecent times that this action had been scientifically put inevidence.(_Times_, August 3rd, 1892.)And Dr. Albert Moll, of Berlin, had written the year previously,thatWhen the practical importance of mental influences becomes moregenerally recognised, physicians will be obliged to acknowledge thatpsychology is as important as physiology. Psychology and psychicaltherapeutics will be the basis of a rational treatment of neuroses. Theother methods must group themselves around this; it will be the centre,and no longer a sort of Cinderella of science, which now admits only theinfluence of the body on the mind, and not that of the mind on thebody.(Hypnotism, p. 328.) See also Note XXVIII., 5.                                 XXXII.                    2.... _woo the absent curse_.Even Raciborski condemns this common error of treatment:... quand lesjeunes filles de cette catgorie paraissent souffrantes, quel que soitle caractre des souffrances, on est dispos  les attribuer au dfautdu flux menstruel, on le regrette, on linvoque, et lon tente tout pourle provoquer. Ces ides sont aujourdhui encore trs profondmentenracines dans le public, et sont souvent la cause des entraves autraitement rationnel propos par les mdecins.(Trait, &c., ed. 1868,p. 377.)And Mrs. E. B. Duffey very sensibly says:Nature ... is very easily perverted: and the girl who begins byimagining she is ill or ought to be at such times will end by beingreally so. (No Sex in Education, Philadelphia, 1874, p. 79.)                     3.... _counter-effort_ ...Forel and many others mention that there are certain popular methods ofslightly retarding menstruation. In one town many of the young women tiesomething round their little finger if they wish to delay menstruationfor a few days in order to go to a ball, &c. The method is generallyeffectual, but when faith ceases, the effect also ceases.Dr. AlbertMoll (Hypnotism, p. 226).Before quitting this special subject it may be well to remark thatlittle more than the fringe is here indicated of an enormous mass ofevidence which affords more than presumptive confirmation and supportfor the position here taken in the whole question of this abnormalhabit.                4.... _custom_ ...See Note XXIV., 6.                                XXXIII.                 2.... _newer vigour to the brain_.It is well-known that every organ of the body and, therefore, also thebrain, requires for its full development and, consequently, for thedevelopment of its complete capability of performance, exercise andpersistent effort. That this is and has been the case for thousands ofyears in a far less degree in woman than in man, in consequence of herdefective training and education, will be denied by no one. So says thelearned biologist Bchner.(Man, Dallass translation, p. 206.)And Bebel also declares:The brain must be regularly used andcorrespondingly nourished, like any other organ, if its faculties are tobe fully developed.(Woman, Walthers translation, p. 124.)Dr. Emanuel Bonavia, in the course of an able reply to a somewhatshallow recent disquisition by Sir James Crichton Browne, says:From various sources we have learnt that the brain tissue, like everyother tissue, will _grow_ by exercise, and diminish, or degenerate andatrophy by disuse. Keep your right arm tied up in a sling for a month,and you will then be convinced how much it has lost by disuse. Thenanatomists might perhaps be able to sayLo! and behold! the muscles ofyour right arm have a less specific gravity than those of your left arm;that the nerves and blood-vessels going to those muscles are smaller,and that, _therefore_, the right arm cannot be the equal of the left,and must have a different function!Any medical student knows that if you tie the main trunk of an artery,a branch of it will in due course acquire the _calibre_ of the maintrunk. If, for some reason, it cannot do so, the tissues, which the maintrunk originally supplied, _must_ suffer, and be weakened, from want ofa sufficient supply of blood.... Man, and especially British man, hasevolved into what he is by endless trouble and struggle through pastages. He has had to develop his present brain from very smallbeginnings. It would, therefore, now be the height of folly to allow thethinking lobes of the mothers of the race to revert, intellectually, bydisuse step by step again to that of the lower animals, from which weall come. That of course many may not believe, but it may be asked, howcan he or she believe these things with such weakened lobes, as he orshe may have inherited from his or her mother? How indeed! If there isanything in nature that is true, it is thisThat if you dont use yourlimbs they will atrophy; if you dont use your eyes they will atrophy;if you dont use your brain it will atrophy. They all follow the sameinexorable law. Use increases and sharpens; disuse decreases and dulls.Diminished size of the frontal lobes and of the arteries that feed themmean nothing if they do not mean that womans main thinking organ, thatof the intellect, is, as Sir James would hint, degenerating by _disuse_and neglect.(Womans Frontal Lobes, _Provincial Medical Journal_,July, 1892.)These facts suggest strongly that the waste at present induced in thefemale body by the menstrual habit might well be absorbed in increase ofbrain power; and indeed, that this evolved habit has hithertopersistently sequestrated and carried off from womans organism theblood force that should have gone to form brain power. This explanationwould dispose of the awkwardly imagined plethora theory, as well asone or two others, of sundry gyncologists.And the conversethat the increased appropriation of the blood informing brain power induces a state of bodily well-being, free from thepresent waste and weariness,would certainly seem to be borne out bysuch evidence as that of the Hon. John W. Mitchell, the president of theSouthern California College of Law, who said in a recent lecture:Not only in this, but in other countries, there are successful womenpractitioners (of Law), and in France, where the preparatory course ismost arduous, and the term of study longest, a woman recently took thehighest rank over 500 men in her graduating examinations, and during thewhole six years of class study she only lost one day from her work.(See Note LVII., 1.)A few words may here be said as to the dubitable question of therelative size of the brain in man and woman, though the matter may notbe of great import, from more than one reason. For, as Bebel observes:Altogether the investigations on the subject are too recent and too fewin number to allow of any definite conclusions (p. 123). A. Dumas filssays (Les Femmes qui Tuent, p. 196)Les philosophes vous dmontrerontque, si la force musculaire de lhomme est plus grande que celle de lafemme, la force nerveuse de la femme est plus grande que celle delhomme; que, si lintelligence tient, comme on laffirme aujourdhui,au dveloppement et au poids de la matire crbrale, lintelligence dela femme pourrait tre dclare suprieure  celle de lhomme, le plusgrand cerveau et le plus lourd comme poids, tant un cerveau de femmelequel pesait 2,200 grammes, cest a dire 400 grammes de plus que celuide Cuvier. On ne dit pas, il est vrai, que cette femme ait critlquivalent du livre de Cuvier sur les fossiles.To which last remark may be replied, again in the words ofBebel,Darwin is perfectly right in saying that a list of the mostdistinguished women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music, science, andphilosophy, will bear no comparison with a similar list of the mostdistinguished men. But surely this need not surprise us. It would besurprising if it were not so. Dr. Dodel-Port (in Die neuereSchpfungsgeschichte) answers to the point, when he maintains that therelative achievements would be very different after men and women hadreceived the same education and the same training in art and scienceduring a certain number of generations.(Woman, p. 125.)It is of small value to sayyes, but look how _many_ men excel and howfew women do so. True, but see how much repression men have exercised to_prevent_ women from even equalling them, and how much shallowness ofmind they have encouraged. All manner of obstructions, coupled withridicule, have been put in their way, and until women succeed inemancipating themselves, most men will probably continue to do so,simply because they have the power to do it. When women becomeemancipated, that is, are placed on social equality with men, thissenseless, mischievous opposition will die a natural death.E. Bonavia,M.D. (Womans Frontal Lobes).To revert to the question of brain weight, one of the first of Englishspecialists says:Data might, therefore, be considered to show, in the strongest manner,how comparatively unimportant is mere bulk or weight of brain inreference to the degree of intelligence of its owner, when considered asit often is, apart from the much more important question of the relativeamount of its grey matter, as well as of the amount and perfection ofthe minute internal development of the organ either actual orpossible.Dr. H. C. Bastian (The Brain as an Organ of Mind, p. 375.)The American physiologist Helen H. Gardener states:The differences (inbrain) between individuals of the same sexin adults at least, are knownto be much more marked than any that are known to exist between thesexes. Take the brains of the two poets Byron and Dante. Byrons weighed1,807 grammes, while Dantes weighed only 1,320 grammes, a difference of487 grammes. Or take two statesmen, Cromwell and Gambetta. Cromwellsbrain weighed 2,210 grammes, which, by the way, is the greatest healthybrain on record; although Cuviers is usually quoted as the largest, apart of the weight of his was due to disease, and if a diseased orabnormal brain is to be taken as the standard, then the greatest onrecord is that of a negro criminal idiot; while Gambettas was only1,241 grammes, a difference of 969 grammes. Surely it will not be heldbecause of this that Gambetta and Dante should have been denied theeducational and other advantages which were the natural right of Byronand Cromwell. Yet it is upon this very ground, by this very system ofreasoning, that it is proposed to deny women equal advantages andopportunities, although the difference in brain weight between man andwoman is said to be only 100 grammes, and even this does not allow fordifference in body weight, and is based upon a system of averages, whichis neither complete nor accurate.(Report of the International Councilof Women, Washington, 1888, p. 378.)Concerning an assertion that the specific gravity of both the white andgrey matter of the brain is greater in man than in woman, Helen H.Gardener says:Of this point this is what the leading brain anatomistin America (Dr. E. C. Spitzka) wrote: The only article recognised bythe profession as important and of recent date, which takes this theoryas a working basis, is by Morselli, and he is compelled to make thesinister admission, while asserting that the specific gravity is less inthe female, that with old age and with insanity the specific gravityincreases. If this is the case I do not know that women need sigh overtheir shortcoming in the item of specific gravity. There appear to betwo very simple methods open to them by which they may emulate theirbrothers in the matter of specific gravity, if they so desire. One ofthese is certain, if they live long enough; and the otherwell, there isno protective tariff on insanity.(_Loc. cit._, p. 379.)Helen Gardener further appositely observes:The brain of no remarkablewoman has ever been examined. Woman is ticketed to fit the hospitalsubjects and tramps, the unfortunates whose brains fall into the handsof the profession as it were by mere accident, while man is representedby the brains of the Cromwells, Cuviers, Byrons, and Spurzheims. By thismethod the average of mens brains is carried to its highest level inthe matter of weight and texture; while that of women is kept at itslowest, and even then there is only claimed 100 grammesdifference!(_Loc. cit._, p. 380.)And she concludes her exhaustive paper with the closing paragraph of aletter to herself from Dr. E. C. Spitzka, the celebrated New York brainspecialist:You may hold me responsible for the following declaration:That any statement to the effect that an observer can tell by looking ata brain, or examining it microscopically, whether it belonged to afemale or a male subject, is not founded on carefully-observed facts....No such difference has ever been demonstrated, nor do I think it will beby more elaborate methods than we now possess. Numerous female brainsexceed numerous male brains in absolute weight, in complexity ofconvolutions, and in what brain anatomists would call the noblerproportions. So that he who takes these as his criteria of the malebrain may be grievously mistaken in attempting to assert the sex of abrain dogmatically. If I had one hundred female brains and one hundredmale brains together, I should select the one hundred containing thelargest and best-developed brains as probably containing fewer femalebrains than the remaining one hundred. More than this no cautiousexperienced brain anatomist would venture to declare.(_Loc. cit._, p.381.)Charles Darwin has clearly summarised this question of comparison ofbrain:No one, I presume, doubts that the large size of the brain inman, relatively to his body, in comparison with that of the gorilla ororang, is closely connected with his higher mental powers.... On theother hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two animals or ofany two men can be accurately gauged by the cubic contents of theirskulls. It is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activitywith an extremely small absolute mass of nervous matter; thus thewonderfully diversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of antsare generally known, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as thequarter of a small pins head. Under this latter point of view the brainof an ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world,perhaps more marvellous than the brain of man.(The Descent of Man,Chap. IV.)                     3._Wide shall she roam_ ...John Ruskin says, of training a girl:Let her loose in the library, Isay, as you do a fawn in a field. It knows the bad weeds twenty timesbetter than you, and the good ones too; and will eat some bitter andprickly ones, good for it, which you had not the slightest thought weregood.(Sesame and Lilies, p. 167.)                       6.... _murmurings_ ...Man thinks that his wife belongs to him like his domesticated animals,and he keeps her therefore in slavery. There are few, however, who weartheir shackles without feeling their weight, and not a few who resentit. Madame Roland says: Quand vous parlez en matre, vous faites penseraussitt quon peut vous rsister, et faire plus peut tre, tel fort quevous soyez. Linvulnerable Achille ne ltait pas partout.AlexanderWalker, M.D. (Woman as to Mind, &c., p. 353).Why do women not discover, when in the noon of beautys power, thatthey are treated like queens only to be deluded by hollow respect, tillthey are led to resign, or not assume, their natural prerogatives?Confined then in cages like the feathered race, they have nothing to dobut to plume themselves and stalk with mock majesty from perch to perch.It is true they are provided with food and raiment, for which theyneither toil nor spin, but health liberty, and virtue are given inexchange.Mary Wollstonecraft (Vindication of the Rights of Woman,Chap. IV.). See also Note XL., 5.What have they (men) hitherto offered us in marriage, with a great showof generosity and a flourish of trumpets, but the dregs of a life, andthe leavings of a dozen other women? Experience has at last taught uswhat to expect and how to meet them.Lady Violet Greville (_NationalReview_, May, 1892).See also Note XX., 2.               8._Lest that her soul should rise_ ...Laboulaye distinctly advises his readers to keep women in a state ofmoderate ignorance, for notre empire est dtruit, si lhomme estreconnu (Our empire is at an end when man is found out).(Note toBebel, Walthers translation, p. 73.)_Id._... _break his timeworn yoke_.As already shown, the subjugation of woman has not been an incident ofWestern civilisation alone. Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham relates that When aChinese Mandarin in California was told that the women of America werenearly all taught to read and write, and that a majority of them wereable to keep books for their husbands, if they chose to do so, he shookhis head thoughtfully, and, with a foreboding sigh, replied, If hereadee, writee, byn-by he lickee all the men. Was that a barbariansentiment, or rather, perhaps, a presentiment of the higher sovereigntycoming?(Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 41.)                                 XXXIV.                      5.... _his servitude_ ...Villeins were not protected by Magna Charta. _Nullus liber homocapiatur vel imprisonetur_, &c., was cautiously expressed to excludethe poor villein, for, as Lord Coke tells us, the lord may beat hisvillein, and, if it be without cause, he cannot have any remedy. What adegraded condition for a being endued with reason!Edward Christian(Note to Blackstones Commentaries, Book II., Chap. VI.)Mr. Christians exclamation of concern is doubtless meant to apply tothe serf, yet was not the lords position equally despicable?               6.... _in turn was master to a slave_.This was, in fact, simply extending the spirit of the feudal system(with its serfdom as just pictured), a little further. Buckleexemplifies in ancient French society the servility descending fromone grade to another in man:By virtue of which each class exercisinggreat power over the one below it, the subordination and subserviencyof the whole were completely maintained.... This, indeed, is but partof the old scheme to create distinctions for which Nature has given nowarrant, to substitute a superiority which is conventional for thatwhich is real, and thus try to raise little minds above the level ofgreat ones. The utter failure, and, as society advances, the eventualcessation of all such attempts is certain. But, meanwhile, evilaccompaniments are apparent, as Buckle further instances by saying:Le Vassor, who wrote late in the reign of Louis XIV., bitterly says:Les Franais accoutums  lesclavage, ne sentent plus la pesanteurde leurs chanes.(History of Civilisation in England, Vol. II,Chaps III., IV.)That the foregoing habits or foibles are human rather than simplymasculine, or that the imitation of them very naturally spreads to theother sex, would seem to be shown by such evidence as Letourneau gives:In primitive countries the married womanthat is to say, the womanbelonging to a manhas herself the conscience of being a thing, aproperty (it is proved to her often and severely enough), but she doesnot think of retaliating, especially in what concerns the conjugalrelations. Moreover, as her condition is oftenest that of a slaveoverburdened with work, not only does she not resent the introduction ofother women in the house of the master, but she desires it, for the workwill be so much the less for herself. Thus among the Zulus the wifefirst purchased strives and works with ardour in the hope of furnishingher husband with means to acquire a second wife, a companion in miseryover whom, by right of seniority, she will have the upper hand.(TheEvolution of Marriage, Chap. VIII.)Yet, in point of fact, this is not woman seeking to establish her owndominion, but rather to secure somewhat more of freedom for herself. AsAlexandre Dumas fils tells us, concerning the Mormon women:Non seulement elles donnent leur consentement  leurs maris, quand ilsle leur demandent pour un nouveau mariage, mais elles sont quelquefoisles premires  leur proposer une nouvelle femme qui a, disent-elles,des qualits ncessaires  la communaut, en ralit pour augmenter unpeu la possession delles-mmes, cest--dire leur libert.(LesFemmes qui Tuent, &c., p. 169.)                      8.... _vassalage to man_.The Laureate Rowe makes his heroine bitterly but with reason exclaim:         How hard is the condition of our sex,         Through every state of life the slaves of man!         In all the dear delightful days of youth,         A rigid father dictates to our wills,         And deals out pleasure with a scanty hand:         To his, the tyrant husbands reign succeeds;         Proud with opinions of superior reason,         He holds domestic business and devotion         All we are capable to know, and shuts us,         Like cloistered idiots, from the worlds acquaintance         And all the joys of freedom. Wherefore are we         Born with high souls, but to assert ourselves,         Shake off this vile obedience they exact,         And claim an equal empire oer the world?                 (The Fair Penitent, Act III. sc. i.)Letourneau shows the state of feminine tutelage carried still further:We shall find that in many civilisations relatively advanced, widowhoodeven does not gratify the woman with a liberty of which she is neverthought worthy. And later on he quotes from the code of Manu, BookV.:A little girl, a young woman, and an old woman ought never to doanything of their own will, even in their own house.... During herchildhood a woman depends on her father; during her youth on herhusband; her husband being dead, on her sons; if she has no sons, on thenear relatives of her husband; or in default of them, on those of herfather; if she has no paternal relatives, on the Sovereign. A womanought never to have her own way.(The Evolution of Marriage, Chaps.VII., XII.)Can a man be esteemed a human or even a rational being, who would acceptor tolerate such terms for the life of his sister womanthe mother ofthe generations to come?See also Note XVII., 8.                                 XXXV.         1, 2.... _fearing that the slave herself might guess                 The knavery of her forced enchainedness_.Here I believe is the clue to the feeling of those men who have a realantipathy to the equal freedom of women. I believe they are afraid, notlest women should be unwilling to marry ... but lest they should insistthat marriage should be on equal conditions; but all women of spirit andcapacity should prefer doing almost anything else, not in their own eyesdegrading, rather than marry, when marrying is giving themselves amaster, and a master too of all their earthly possessions. And truly, ifthis consequence were necessarily incident to marriage, I think that theapprehension would be very well founded.J S. Mill (The Subjection ofWomen, p. 51).See also Note XL., 4.                         5.... _dogmas_ ...These dogmas which, under the guise of religion, were imposed on theacceptance of womanhood, may be aptly summarised and epitomised in thefollowing lines from one of the hierarchs of the system:           To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adornd:           My author and disposer, what thou biddst           Unargued I obey: so God ordains;           God is thy law, thou mine; to know no more           Is womans happiest knowledge, and her praise.                           (Paradise Lost, Book IV., 634.)Concerning which words of Milton well may Mary Wollstonecraft observe,with a quiet sarcasm:If it be allowed that women were destined byProvidence to acquire human virtues, and, by the exercise of theirunderstandings, that stability of character which is the firmest groundto rest our future hopes upon, they must be permitted to turn to thefountain of light, and not forced to shape their course by the twinklingof a satellite.(Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Chap. II.)Milton also discoursed learnedly, but self-interestedly, concerningdivorce, claiming for the husband a privilege and option which heutterly denied to the wife:... the power and arbitrement of divorcefrom the master of the family, into whose hands God and the law of allnations had put it ... that right which God from the beginning hadentrusted to the husband.(The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.)It was this same medival moralist who trained his daughters in thepronunciation of various languages, that they might minister to hiscomfort by reading to him in those tongues; while he carefully withheldfrom them any knowledge of the meaning of the words they were uttering.Could a greater insult or a more degrading office be inflicted on acultured human intellect? Small wonder that his daughters weresufficiently undutiful and unkindas Milton styled itto leave himsome years before his death. That the possessor of the same virileintellect which penned the Areopagitica, with its brave freedom, couldtolerate and promulgate the servitude and degradation of one half ofhumanity indicates in him a mental darkness as gross and as pitiable ashis physical blindness.                     6, 7.... _sanctimonious name                            Of womans duty_ ...Hitherto the world has been governed by brute force only, which meansthat the stronger animal, man, has kept the weaker in subjection,allowing her to live only in so far as she ministered to his comforts;that he has not unnaturally made laws and fixed customs to suit his ownpleasure and convenience, always at the expense of the woman; and, whatis worse, that he has in all countries given a religious sanction to hisvices, in order to bend the woman to his wishes.... I might also addthat all cruel customs relating to woman have been imposed upon herunder the guise of religion, and hence, though so injurious and banefulto herself, she is even slower to change them than the man. There ishardly any cruel wrong which has been inflicted in the course of ages byman upon his fellow-man that has not been justified by an appeal toreligion.Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address to the Hindoos ofBombay)._Id._... There is nothing which men so easily learn as thisself-worship: all privileged persons, and all privileged classes, havehad it.... Philosophy and religion, instead of keeping it in check, aregenerally suborned to defend it.J. S. Mill (The Subjection of Women,p. 77)._Id._... A. Dumas fils speaks of les femmes, ces ternelles mineuresdes religions et des codes; and of les arguments  laide desquelslEglise veut mettre les femmes de son ct; and shows as the effectthat Il y a des femmes honntes, esclaves du devoir, pieuses. Leurreligion leur a enseign le sacrifice. Non seulement elles ne seplaignent pas des preuves  traverser mais elles les appellent pourmriter encore plus la rcompense promise, et elles les bnissent quandelles viennent. Tout arrive, pour elles, par la volont de Dieu, et toutest comme il doit tre dans cette valle des larmes, chemin delternit bienheureuse.... Dailleurs elles ne lisent ni les journaux,ni les livres o il est question de ces choses-l; cette lecture leurest interdite. Si, par hasard, elles avaient connaissance de pareillesides, ... elles en rougiraient, elles en souffriraient pour leur sexe,et elles prieraient pour celles qui se laissent aller  propager de sidangereuses erreurs et  donner de si dplorables exemples.... Mais, pasplus que le bonheur, la ruse, lignorance, la misre et la servitude, lafoi aveugle, lextase, et limmobilit volontaire de lesprit ne sontdes arguments sans rplique.(Les Femmes qui Tuent, &c., pp. 10, 91,103.)The evil which Dumas points out is common to all religions, of whateverrace or make; the hall-mark of every creed, from Confucianism toComtism, has been the subjection of woman, under the affectation ofadvocating her highest interests. The pious compound has usually beenaltered to meet the growing intellectual requirements of common-senseand justice and humanity, and hence the precepts of religion as tofeminine conduct have by no means always lain in such lines as themultitude in our modern Western civilisation still enjoins on women. Nomore than the whole and universal attitude of religion, ancient ormodern, as regards woman, is exposed or expressed in the followingrecapitulation of present or historic facts:It is not the chastity ofwomen, as we understand it, but her subjection, that Japanese moralityrequires. The woman is a thing possessed, and her immorality consistssimply in disposing freely of herself.As regards prostitution, Brahmanic India is scarcely more scrupulousthan Japan, and there again we find religious prostitution practised inthe temples, analogous to that which in ancient Greece was practised atCyprus, Corinth, Miletus, Tenedos, Lesbos, Abydos, &c. (Lecky, Historyof European Morals, Vol. I., p. 103). According to the legend, theBuddha himself, Sakyamouni, when visiting the famous Indian town ofVasali, was received there by the great mistress of the courtesans.(Mrs. Spier, Life in Ancient India, p. 28).Letourneau (TheEvolution of Marriage, Chap. X.).The enforcement, or commendation, or acceptance of the practice ofprostitution, with its profanation of the dignity and individuality ofwoman, and its utter carelessness and disregard for either her physicalor intellectual well-being, is indubitable evidence of the man-made(_i.e._, male) origin of such a scheme of religion or ethics oreconomics. For, as Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham truly remarks:If a doubt yetremains on the mind of any reader that I have stated truly the part ofthe masculine as cause in this terrible phenomenon, let it be consideredhow man has always introduced prostitution in every country that he hasvisited, and every island of the sea. Does anyone believe, for example,that if the voyages of discovery and trade had been made by womeninstead of men, to the islands of the Pacific, this scourge would havebeen left as the testimony of their visit, so that, in a fewgenerations, the populations native there would have fallen a literalsacrifice to their sensuality, as they are actually falling to mans atthis day? There is no comment needed on the illustration, I am sure. Thecommon sense of every reader will furnish the best comment and answerthe question correctly.(Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 299.)_Id._... Lastly, but most convincingly, as to the wilful and intentionaldegradation and subjugation of woman by the teaching and rites ofreligion, let it be noted that, among the Jews, the very fact of being awoman is made a disgrace; and woman, the mother of the human race, isinsulted accordingly. In the morning synagogue service of prayer,directly after unitedly blessing Adonai, for bestowing on thebarn-door fowl the power to distinguish between night and day, and fornot having created the worshippers present heathens or slaves, eachmember of the male portion of the congregation thanks the same Adonaithat Thou hast not fashioned me as a woman, while each member of thesegregated female portion of the company is instructed to submissivelygive thanks that Thou hast fashioned me after Thine own pleasure. Themale thanks for not being heathens seem, under the circumstances,conspicuously premature.(See Ohel Jakob, _i.e._, Jacobs Temple,the Daily Prayer of the Israelites, Fraenkels ed., Berlin.)That the spirit of this Mosaic or Hebrew sexual teaching, with itsincongruous assertions and inferences, has communicated itself deeply toChristianity, may be observed from such passages as 1 Tim. ii. 13, 14; 1Cor. vii., 9; Eph. v. 24; Col. iii. 18; 1 Pet. iii. 1, 5; and manyothers._Id._... Buckle quotes from Fergusson on the Epistles, 1656, p.242:The great and main duty which a wife, as a wife, ought to learn,and so learn as to practice it, is to be subject to her own husband.(See also Note XVII., 8.) And Buckle further cites, from FoxsJournal, After the middle of the seventeenth century the Quakers setup womens meetings, to the disgust of many, and (query, because) inthe teeth of St. Pauls opinion.(Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works,Vol. I., pp. 375, 384.)_Id._... As already said, the sanctimonious claim of womans dutyruns through all religions. Here, for instance, is what is reported in aleader of the _Manchester Guardian_ of August 15th, 1892:  In this country no one would place suicide in the ranks of the  virtues. Here it is a crime, but in China under certain circumstances  it is regarded as an act of heroism and devotion worthy of sympathy  and of national recognition. Thus the Governor of Shansi forwarded to  the Emperor of China a memorial setting forth the virtues as daughter  and wife of a lady in that province. She was of good family, both her  father and grandfather having been officials in the district. At the  age of ten she showed her love for her mother in a peculiarly Chinese  fashion. One of the Celestial beliefs is that medicine acquires  efficacy by having mingled with it some human flesh, and the little  girl cut some from her own body to be used for the purpose of curing  an illness which threatened her mothers life. In 1890 she was married  to an expectant magistrate, whose expectations were realised by his  appointment last autumn to a judicial post. What she had, as a good  daughter, done for her mother, she, as a good wife, did also for her  husband, who fell ill; but her remedy was inefficacious, and he died.  She was now in a position which, according to the Chinese code of  ethics, has no responsibilities for a woman. Without parents, husband,  or children to demand her affectionate care, she decided to commit  suicide, and apparently not only communicated her intentions to those  around her, but had their sympathy and support in her decision. We are  told that, only waiting till she had completed the arrangements for  her husbands interment, she swallowed gold and powder of lead. She  handed her _trousseau_ to her relations to defray her funeral  expenses, and made presents to the younger members of the family and  the servants, after which, draped in her state robes, she sat waiting  her end. The poison began to work, and soon all was over. The story  of a distracted wife seeking refuge in death from the sorrows of  widowhood might doubtless be told of any country in Europe, but the  sequel is possible only in China. The Governor of Shansi, struck with  the courage of the lady in what he evidently regards as a very proper  though somewhat unusual exhibition of conjugal affection, asks in his  memorial that the virtuous life and death of the lady may be duly  commemorated. The prayer of the memorial has been granted by the  Emperor and a memorial arch is to be erected in honour of the  suicide.                    8.... _this reasoned day_ ...See Note XVII., 8.                                 XXXVI.                      1._By cant condoned_ ...Much has been said by Guizot on the influence of women in developingEuropean civilisation. It is at least certain that several of thefathers did everything they could to diminish that influence. Tertullianbitterly complains of the insolence of women who venture to teach and tobaptise. He allows that in case of necessity baptism may be administeredby a layman, but never by a woman. Again, among the other crimes of theheretics he particularly enumerates the insolence of their women, whoventured to teach, to dispute, &c., &c. In De Cult. Faem, lib. I. Cap.I., he says: Let women remember that they are of the sex of Eve, whoruined mankind, and let them therefore repair this ignominy by livingrather in dust than in splendour.Buckle (Common-Place Book, Note1870)._Id._... _man fashioned womans sphere_.We deny the right of any portion of the species to decide for anotherportion, or any individual for another individual, what is, and what isnot, their proper sphere. The proper sphere for all human beings isthe largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is,cannot be ascertained without complete liberty of choice.Mrs. HarrietMill (Enfranchisement of Women, _Westminster Review_, July 1851).                        6.... _civil law_ ...For example of this let us look at the law of our own country in evenrecent times. Blackstone says:The husband (by the old law) might givehis wife moderate correction.... But this power of correction wasconfined within reasonable bounds, and the husband was prohibited fromusing any violence to his wife, _aliter quam ad virum ex causa regiminiset castigationis uxoris su licite et rationabiliter pertinet_ (_i.e._,otherwise than to a man for the ruling and punishment of his wife,lawfully and reasonably pertains). The civil law gave the husband thesame or a larger authority over his wife, allowing him for somemisdemeanours, _flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem_ (_i.e._,to severely beat his wife with whips and cudgels), for others, only_modicam castigationem adhibere_ (to administer a moderatechastisement). But with us, in the politer reign of Charles the Second,this power of correction began to be doubted, and a wife may now(_circ._ 1750) have security of peace against her husband; or in return,a husband against his wife. Yet the lower rank of people, who werealways fond of the old common law, (query, were the women fond of it?)still claim and exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of lawwill still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case ofany gross misbehaviour. (Commentaries, Edward Christians Ed., BookI., Chap. XV.)Such was undoubtedly the generally accepted and not infrequently actedupon assumption; and it is certain that the Courts of Law would, in theevent of a wife absenting herself from her husband, order her return tohis custody; and would, and did imprison her in default of hercompliance. And this state of things continued untilas Mrs.Wolstenholme Elmy records in her history of the celebrated Clitheroecase  At length, in the year 1891, and, as in the case of the negro  Somerset, upon the return to a writ of _habeas corpus_, there have  been found judges bold enough and just enough to set aside the ancient  saws and maxims, resting mainly upon _obiter dicta_ and loose phrases  of previous judges used in reference to hypothetical cases never  actually before the Courts, and to declare plainly and straightly that  the personal slavery of the wife is no part of the law of England. The  actual words of the Lord Chancellor in dealing with the return to the  writ are, as reported by the _Times_, March 20th, 1891, as follows:  After stating the circumstances of the marriage, the decree, and the  refusal of the wife to cohabit, it states: I therefore took my wife,  and have since detained her in my house, using no more force or  restraint than necessary to take her and keep her. That is the return  which seeks to justify an admitted imprisonment of this lady. I do not  know that I am able to express in sufficiently precise language the  difference between confinement and imprisonment, but if there is  any distinction, I can only say that upon these facts I should find an  imprisonment, and looking at the return it is put as a broad  proposition that the right of the husband, where there has been a  wilful absenting of herself by the wife from her husbands housethat  it is his right to seize possession of his wife by force, and detain  her in his house until she renders him conjugal rights. That is the  proposition of law involved in the return, and I am not prepared to  assent to it. The Legislature has expressly deprived the Matrimonial  Court of the power of imprisoning the wife for refusal to comply with  a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, and the result of such a  system of law, if the husband had the power, would be that whereas the  Court had no power to hand the wife over into her husbands hands, but  only to punish her for contempt by imprisonment under the control of  the Court, and without any circumstances of injury or insult, and even  that power was taken away, the husband might himself of his own motion  seize and imprison her until she consented to the restitution of  conjugal rights. That is the proposition I am called upon to establish  by holding this return to be good. _I am of opinion that no such right  or power exists in law. I am of opinion that no such right ever did  exist in our law._ Whatever authorities may be quoted for any such  proposition, it has always been subject to this condition: that where  she has a complaint of, or is apprehensive of, ill-usage, the Court  will never interfere to compel her to return to her husbands custody.  Now this brings me to the particular circumstances of this  transaction. I am prepared to say that no English subject has a right  to imprison another English subject (who is _sui juris_, and entitled  to a judgment of his or her own) without any lawful authority, but if  there were any qualification of that proposition I should be of  opinion that on the facts of this case it would afford an ample  justification to any Court for refusing to allow the husband in this  case to retain the custody of his wife.  On these and other grounds the Lord Chancellor declared that the  return of the writ was bad, and ordered that the lady be restored to  her liberty, the other judges concurring.(The Decision in the  Clitheroe Case and its Consequences, pp. 3, 4.)Lord Esher was one of the two other Judges, both concurring, who formedthe Court of Appeal which granted the writ, and a few days subsequentlyhe gave from his place in the House of Lords the following furtherstatement of his judgment and views:  As I was a party to the judgment, which seems to have been more  misunderstood than any judgment I recollect, I, perhaps, may be  excused from making an observation. It was urged before the Court of  Appeal that by the law of England a husband may beat his wife with a  stick if she refuses to obey him, and that if a wife refused her  husband conjugal rights, whatever that phrase may mean, which I have  never been able to make out, he may imprison her until she restores  him conjugal rights, or satisfies him that she will. All that the  Court of Appeal decided was that a husband cannot by the law of  England, if the wife objects, lawfully do either of those things.  Those intelligent people who have declared that the judgment is wrong  must be prepared to maintain the conversenamely, that if a wife  disobeys her husband he may lawfully beat her; and if she refuses him  a restitution of conjugal rights he may imprison her, it was urged, in  the cellar, or in the cupboard, or, if the house is large, in the  house, by locking her in it and blocking the windows. I thought, and  still think, that the law does not allow these things....(The  _Times_, 17th April, 1891.)Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy further tells us that:  To Lord Selborne the married women of this country owe a further debt  of gratitude for his introduction in 1884 of the Matrimonial Causes  Act of that session, which put an end to the punishment by  imprisonment of the husband or wife who refused to obey the decree of  the Court for restitution of conjugal rights. The arguments of Mr.  Lankester and Mr. Finlay in the Clitheroe case, based upon this  abolition of the power of the Court to imprison for disobedience, are  known to everyone. It would be destructive not only to personal  freedom, but a gross infraction of justice and common-sense, were a  husband to be permitted to exercise on his own behalf and at his own  pleasure a prerogative of punishment which had been withdrawn from the  Court.  That this power of imprisonment was not a mere _brutum fulmen_, but a  terrible reality in former days, may be learned from a Suffolk case,  early in the present century. A wife in contempt of court, a lady of  good family in Suffolk, was imprisoned in Ipswich goal for disobeying  a decree requiring her to render conjugal rights to her husband. At  the end of a year and ten months she became in want of the common  necessaries of life, and was reduced to the gaol allowance of bread  and water; she suffered from rheumatism and other maladies, which were  aggravated by the miseries of her imprisonment; and after many years  of such suffering died in prisonfor she never went back to her  husband.(The Decision in the Clitheroe Case and its Consequences,  p. 9.)But while the law has thus been needfully amended in England, a furtherevil effect has meantime supervened in our dependency of India; for thisfaculty of imprisonment by the Courts for non-compliance with theirorder in the event specified, which has been abolished in England, seemsto be still existent and appealed to in our Indian Courts. (See NoteXXII., 2.) The strange thing is that the suit for the restitution ofconjugal rights is not a matter of native law, but an inadvertent andapparently entirely unintentional introduction from our English system;the very judges who administer the Indian Law being at a loss to accountfor its appearance in their practice. One authority, in seeking thesolution of the problem, declares thatMr.  could not find anyenactment directly establishing suits for the restitution of conjugalrights, and believed there were none; but that they had been recognisedin a Stamp Act, and again in the Limitation of Suits Act passed in1871. The material point is that Indian lawgivers have not consciouslygiven this remedy to those who did not possess it before; but that ithas slipped into our law without design. Mr.  thinks That this classof suits was known in the old Supreme Courts, in the Presidency towns,and as between Europeans; and it was not an improper subject oflegislation as regards Stamp Duty or Limitation by Time: but beingspoken of without qualification was held by the High Courts to beavailable for all classes of the Indian communities. If this theory betrue, it accounts in an easy way for a change effected without anyintention of the Rulers at all. It is worth enquiry into under thisaspect. Yes, enquiry and rectification hand in hand!_Id._... _and part divine_.The fact has been that male lawgivers, in whatever land, have generallyasserted for their code of feminine ethics or conduct a divine origin,and have announced the punishment for breach thereof as a divineinjunction. In very few instances, indeed, was there any attempt todecree an equal punishment to the male who was partner with the femalein a mutual breach of this morality, and very frequently no punishmentof the male attached at all; and even in the few cases where such apunishment was nominally threatened, the mans share in the offence wasmost generally connived at, and passed unpunished. This double code ofmorality has a flagrant exemplification in the English Law of Divorce,by which, while a man can procure a Decree of Divorce on the simpleground of the adultery of his wife, a woman cannot obtain a like decreefor her husbands adultery unless that offence be accompanied by suchtreatment of herself as the Court will recognise as cruelty, or withdesertion. The double scheme of sexual morality, so revoltinglytolerated, in so far as man is concerned, by society in the presentday is too patent to need further words here. And the repulsive cant isstill that, while the man is allowed to go free, the punishment of thewoman is due and commendable as in accordance with divine law. (SeeNote XIV., 3.)                                XXXVII.         3, 4.... _lowest boor is lordly baron styled,                 And highest bride as common feme reviled_.... husband and wife; or, as most of our elder law books call them,baron and feme.(Blackstones Commentaries, Bk. I. Chap. 15.)But the context of the words baron and feme involved something morethan a mere _faon de parler_ of the law books. Edward Christian says,in Note 23 to the Chapter in Blackstone above quoted:Husband andwife, in the language of the law, are styled _baron_ and _feme_; theword baron, or lord, attributes to the husband not a very courteoussuperiority. But we might be inclined to think this merely an unmeaningtechnical phrase, if we did not recollect, that if the baron kills hisfeme it is the same as if he had killed a stranger or any other person;but if the feme kills her baron it is regarded by the laws as a muchmore atrocious crime, as she not only breaks through the restraints ofhumanity and conjugal affection, but throws off all subjection to theauthority of her husband. And, therefore, the law denominates her crimea species of treason, and condemns her to the same punishment as if shehad killed the king. And for every species of treason (though in petittreason the punishment of men was only to be drawn and hanged), till the30 Geo. III., Chap. 48, the sentence of woman was to be drawn and burntalive.And Mr. Courtney Kenny says, on the same point, that the English Law ofMarriage in the twelfth century had clothed the humblest husband withmore than the authority of a feudal lord, and merged his wifes legalexistence altogether in his own.(History of the Law of MarriedWomens Property, p. 8.)And he exemplifies the position of the feme as being accuratelydepicted in the words of Petruchio:            I will be master of what is mine own,            She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,            My household stuff, my field, my barn,            My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything.            (The Taming of the Shrew, Act III., scene 2.)The picture of the past masculine proprietorship and bullyism isscarcely overdrawn. Ere a distant day Englishmen will shudder inreflecting on the male creatures who were their progenitors.         5, 6._The tardier fear that grants the clown a share                 In his own governance, denies it her._By a leading article on Woman Suffrage, in the _Times_ of 29th April,1892, a clear light is thrown on the causes which largely influenced theextension of the Parliamentary franchise to the poorer class of malecitizens,a share of political power which they are not particularlywell fitted to use, says the _Times_;and which denied the same rightof franchise to women of whatever class. The intellect of the _Times_enounces that  Without desiring to disparage the sex in any way, we must venture to  maintain that in both camps a large female contingent would be a  mischievous element. The female Conservative politician would be an  obstacle to all rational reform; the female Liberal politician would  be the advocate of every crude and febrile innovation. No doubt we  have put plausible arguments in the mouths of mere logic-choppers by  treating the franchise as a right rather than as a privilege and a  trust. Men can demand a share of _political power which they are not  particularly well fitted to use_, because they possess _de facto_ a  share of the physical force upon which all political arrangements  ultimately repose. Women do not possess such physical force, and,  therefore, can prefer no such claim.Passing over, as unworthy of serious refutation, the wild assertions dueto sex-bias in the first part of the above extract, it may be noted howinstantly the lauded masculine weapon of logic is discarded andcontemned as soon as it points in the direction of equal justice forwoman. The physical force question is further dealt with in Note XLV.,6. But considering the words we have italicised, does not the whole ofthe _Times_ exposition as above justify the appellation of cowardlyfear? (See also p. 78.)_Id._... Yet an even more unworthy thing than denial of the suffrage hastaken place, in that English women have been really robbed of theirearlier franchises. A lady Poor Law Guardian of the Tewkesbury Union haswritten:  ... the present position of women in regard to the various franchises  is anomalous and contradictory, unworthy of that great growth of  freedom which the nineteenth century has given to men, and degenerate  as regards the position which women held in the days of the  Plantagenets and the Tudors. Freedom for women has not broadened down  from precedent to precedent. Rather has it suffered by unnecessary  legislative interference. Every woman, except the Queen, is,  politically, non-existent. It was not always so. Restrictions unknown  to our ancient constitution have crept in.... Chief Justice Lee is  reported to have cited a case (in a manuscript collection of  Hakewells), Catherine _v._ Surrey, in which it was expressly decided,  that a _feme sole_, if she has a freehold, may vote for members of  Parliament; and a further one (from the same collection), Holt _v._  Lyle, in which it was decided, that a _feme sole_ householder may  claim a voice for Parliament men; but, if married, her husband must  vote for her; whilst Justice Page declared, I see no disability in a  woman from voting for a Parliament man. So closely, in the minds of  our Judges, were the local and Parliamentary franchises bound up, that  a question as to the rights of women in local voting seemed to involve  considerations as to their right to vote for Parliament men.  Yet, even in the matter of these local franchises, women have  suffered, and do suffer, from legislative tinkering and sex-biassed  decisions in our law courts.  Down to 1835, women, possessing the qualifications which entitled men  to vote, voted freely in municipal elections, and in some important  cities, such as London and Edinburgh, the civic rights even of married  women, possessing a separate qualification from the husband, were well  established. The Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, however (passed  by the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne), was framed upon the  evil precedent of the Reform Act of 1832, and by the use of the words  male persons, in treating of the franchises under it, disfranchised  every woman in the boroughs to which it applied, and this  disfranchisement lasted for thirty-four years.  Nevertheless, in non-corporate districts, women continued to vote as  freely as before, and thus secured the ultimate restitution of the  rights of their disfranchised sisters in incorporated districts; for,  when in 1869, on the consideration of the Municipal Franchise Bill of  that year, these peculiar facts were brought to the notice of the  House of Commons, and it was shown that the incorporation of any  district involved the summary disfranchisement of the women  ratepayers, the House, without a dissentient word, or any shadow of  opposition, adopted the proposal to omit the word male before the  word person in Section 1 of the Bill, and thus restored the rights  of the women ratepayers, of whom many thousands voted, as a  consequence of the passing of the Act, in the municipal elections of  the following November.Mrs. Harriett McIlquham (The Enfranchisement  of Women: An Ancient Right, a Modern Need, pp. 5, 12, 13.)                 8.... _infants, felons, fools_ ...This legal courteousness has afforded Miss Frances Power Cobbe the textfor an instructive paper: Criminals, Idiots, Women, and Minors: Is theClassification Sound? (_Frasers Magazine_, December, 1868.)A recent instance of the official collocation is to be found in the Act5 and 6 Vict., Cap. 35, Sec. 41:And be it enacted, that the trustee, guardian, tutor, curator, orcommittee of any person, being an infant, or married woman, lunatic,idiot, or insane, and having the direction, control, or management ofthe property or concern of such infant, married woman, lunatic, idiot,or insane person, whether such infant, married woman, lunatic, idiot, orinsane person shall reside in the United Kingdom or not, etc., etc.                                XXXVIII.                    7.... _every bond erased_ ...In the struggle of the races, keeping in view the teachings ofevolutionists, the most reasonable and sensible thing, in addition toits _justness_, appears to be this:First, to place women on an equal footing with men, socially, and _inthe eyes of the law_. Before _that_ is done, it is useless to talk aboutwomens superiority or equality. It is all breath and words, or paperand ink. In the eyes of the law she is mans inferior. That is not all.In the eyes of the law the most cultured woman is inferior to the mostuncultured man; she is, in fact, pretty much on a level with a baby, ora boy or girl under age. Moreover, the most cultured woman in the UnitedKingdom is considered inferior, politically, to the American negro!Second, let the two sexes settle matters among themselves, as far asintellect is concerned, as men now settle matters among themselves,without imposing on each other any disability. Those of both sexes whoare weak will soon find their intellectual level; and those of bothsexes who are strong will soon come to the front.Emanuel Bonavia, M.D.(Womans Frontal Lobes).

Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the    men, Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the    men; ... Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands, Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands, Where the city of the best bodied mothers stands,     There the great city stands.     Walt Whitman (Song of the Broad Axe).             3._Her voice in council and in senate_ ...Is there so great a superfluity of men fit for high duties, thatsociety can afford to reject the service of any competent person? Are weso certain of always finding a man made to our hands for any duty orfunction of social importance which falls vacant, that we lose nothingby putting a ban on one half of mankind and refusing beforehand to maketheir faculties available, however distinguished they may be? And evenif we could do without them, would it be consistent with justice torefuse to them their fair share of honour and distinction, or to deny tothem the equal right of all human beings to choose their occupation(short of injury to others) according to their own preferences, at theirown risk? Nor is the injustice confined to them, it is shared by thosewho are in a position to benefit by their services. To ordain that anykind of persons shall not be physicians, or shall not be advocates, orshall not be members of parliament, is to injure not them only, but allwho employ physicians, or advocates, or elect members of parliament.J.S. Mill (The Subjection of Women, p. 94).                    4.... _harmonising word_ ...... the main reason why so many thoughtful women now claim directParliamentary representation is an unselfish one. They desire to taketheir full share in the service of the race; to help to solve thosegrave social problems now so urgently pressing, and which demand fortheir solution the combined resources of the wisdom, experience, andheart of both halves of humanity. They know that the time is fastcomingif, indeed, it be not already comewhich will need for itsdirection and control something more than diplomatic cleverness orpolitical manuvring, which will demand the clearer conscience and themore sensitive perception of justice born of imaginative sympathy. It isbecause they hope and believe that in virtue of their faculty ofmotherhood they can contribute somewhat of these elements to the worldswell-being, and can thus speed its progress towards a nobler future,that they claim full right and power to follow and fulfil their highestconceptions of duty.Elizabeth C.

This, I say, is the mostfoolish of all errors, respecting her who was made to be the helpmate ofman. As if he could be helped effectively by a shadow, or worthily by aslave.John Ruskin (Of Queens Gardens, p. 125).           4._Free mistress of her persons sacred plan_.Eliza W. Farnham (in Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 92) clearlyenunciates the depth of degradation and slavery from which womansperson must be freed:When this mastery is established, and ownershipof her becomes a fixed fact, she who was worshipped, vowed to as anidol, deferred to as a mistress, required to conform herself to nothingexcept the very pleasant requirement that she should take her own way ineverything; to come and go, to accept or reject, to do or not, at herown supreme pleasurethis being may find herself awaking in a state ofsubjection which deprives her of the most sacred right to her ownpersonmakes her the slave of an exacting demand that ignores theconditions, emotions, susceptibilities, pains, and pleasures of herlife, as tyrannically and systematically as if she were indeed aninsensate chattel.Happily, as far as England is concerned, our law no longer lends itspower to enforce such a position.                       5._Free human soul_ ...Womans deep and wholesome impulse and yearning for individual freedomand selfdom is well-spoken in the following lines, by an anonymouswriter; touchingly shown also is the unsufficingness to her soul of eventhe most honeyed of unequal positions:                     Oh, to be alone!                 To escape from the work, the play,                 The talking every day;                   To escape from all I have done,                 And all that remains to do.

The application of the Pfeiffer bequest, for charitable and  educational purposes in favour of women, has been delayed by legal  difficulties, but the Attorney General has now submitted to the Court  of Chancery a first list of awards. Details given in the _Journal of  Education_ show that Girton and Newnham Colleges receive 5,000 each,  whilst Bedford College, Somerville Hall, the New Hospital for Women,  the Maria Grey Training College, and a number of other institutions  benefit by slightly smaller sums. The bequests will doubtless be  welcomed by the recipients, for all the institutions included so far  are doing useful work with very inadequate means, and it is to be  hoped that the generous example of the London merchant and his  literary wife will be often followed in the future. Womens  educationand girls, too, for that matterin this country is almost  unendowed, and is yet expected to produce results equal to those  gained in the richly endowed foundations for boys and men. The  interest of the Pfeiffer bequest, however, lies rather in the spirit  that prompted it and in the views of progress held by the donors than  in the generosity of the gift or the precise manner of its  distribution. In a letter explaining his wishes, Mr. Pfeiffer  remarks:I have always had and am adhering to the idea of leaving the bulk of myproperty in England for charitable and educational purposes in favour ofwomen. Theirs is, to my mind, the great influence of the future.Education and culture and responsibility in more than one direction,including that of politics, will gradually fit them for the exercise ofevery power that could possibly work towards the regeneration ofmankind. It is women who have hitherto had the worst of life, but theirinterest, and with their interest that of humanity, is secured, and Itherefore am determined to help them to the best of my ability andmeans._Manchester Guardian_, June 7th, 1892.Men are what their mothers made them. You may as well ask a loom whichweaves huckaback, why it does not make cashmere, as expect poetry fromthis engineer, or a chemical discovery from that jobber. Ask the diggerin the ditch to explain Newtons laws; the fine organs of his brain havebeen pinched by overwork and squalid poverty from father to son, for ahundred years. When each comes forth from his mothers womb, the gate ofgifts closes behind him. Let him value his hands and feet, he has butone pair. So he has but one future, and that is already predetermined inhis lobes, and described in that little fatty face, pig-eye, and squatform.Emerson (Essay on Fate)._Id._... The British _race_ cannot afford to dispense with _all_ theadvantage that may be in embryo in the future female intellect, becausemen and some women are found who declare that women are intellectuallyinferior.... No amount of prayers and wishes and submitting to Godswill are of any avail. You must _use_ the organs of the intellect inorder, not only to increase their efficiency, but to prevent their goingfrom bad to worse. It might here be noted, that because the Britishpeople might choose to be satisfied with atrophy of the intellect lobesin their mothers, it will not at all follow that other nations will doso _also_. If such things as nations exist, there will always be rivalryand competition, and depend upon it those will be first whose mothersgenerally possess the most efficient intellect lobes.... Fortunately wehave learnt another great lesson, evolved by Charles Darwins frontallobes, and that is, that there is no such thing as a _fixed_ and_unalterable_ tissue or organism anywhere. All organisms and parts oforganisms are _changeable_. Everythingorgan and organism_has_ changedin the past, _is_ changing in the present, and _will_ change in thefuture in accordance with the conditions that surround it. Womensfrontal lobes and grey matter will certainly be no exception to therule.

They have always hitherto been kept, as far asregards spontaneous development, in so unnatural a state, that theirnature cannot but have been greatly distorted and disguised, and no onecan safely pronounce that if womens nature were left to choose itsdirection as freely as mens, and if no artificial bent were attemptedto be given to it except that required by the conditions of humansociety, and given to both sexes alike, there would be any materialdifference, or perhaps any difference at all, in the character andcapacities which would unfold themselves.J.

If you catch up one half ofthese creatures and train them to a particular set of actions andopinions, and the other half to a perfectly opposite set, of coursetheir understandings will differ, as one or the other sort ofoccupations has called this or that talent into action. There is surelyno occasion to go into any deeper or more abstruse reasoning in order toexplain so very simple a phenomenon.Sydney Smith (Female Education)._Id._... Was it Mary Somerville who had to hide her books, and studyher mathematics by stealth after all the family had gone to sleep, forfear of being scolded and worried because she allowed her intellect fullscope? She has now a bust in the Royal Institution!... Whatever view ofthe case theoretical considerations may suggest, there is one factbeyond cavil, and it is this: that the female frontal lobes are not onlycapable of equalling in power the male lobes, but can surpass them _whenallowed_ free scope. This has been recently proved in one of theuniversities, where a woman surpassed the senior wrangler inmathematicsan essentially intellectual work.Dr. Emanuel Bonavia(Womans Frontal Lobes).The girl graduate last referred to is Miss Philippa Fawcett at theUniversity Examinations, Cambridge, in June, 1890.                       3._Together reared_ ...We find a good example in the United States, where, to the horror oflearned and unlearned pedants of both sexes, numerous colleges exist inwhich large numbers of young men and women are educated together. Andwith what results? President White, of the University of Michigan,expresses himself thus: For some years past a young woman has been thebest scholar of the Greek language among 1,300 students; the beststudent in mathematics in one of the classes of our institution is ayoung woman, and many of the best scholars in natural and generalscience are also young women. Dr. Fairchild, President of OberlinCollege in Ohio, in which over 1,000 students of both sexes study inmixed classes, says: During an experience of eight years as Professorof the ancient languages, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and in the branchesof ethics and philosophy, and during an experience of eleven years intheoretical and applied mathematics, the only difference which I haveobserved between the sexes was in the manner of their rhetoric. EdwardH. Machill, President of Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, tells usthat an experience of four years has forced him to the conclusion thatthe education of both sexes in common leads to the best moral results.This may be mentioned in passing as a reply to those who imagine such aneducation must endanger morality.Bebel (Women, WalthersTranslation, p. 131). (See also Notes to line 7, forward.)It is of good omen that the precedent thus set in America is finding afollowing in our own isle also. All honour to the University of St.Andrews, concerning which sundry newspapers of 15th March, 1892, relatethat: The Senatus Academicus of the University of St. Andrews hasagreed to open its classes in arts, science, and theology to women, whowill be taught along with men. The University will receive next year asum of over 30,000 to be spent on bursaries, one half of the sum to bedevoted to women exclusively. Steps are being taken to secure a hall ofresidence in which the women students may live while attending theUniversity classes.        _Id._... _in purity and truth,                Through plastic childhood and retentive youth_.Je voudrais que ce petit volume apportt au lecteur un peu de lajouissance que jai gote en le composant.

H. Huxley (Essay on ScientificEducation).And the same learned professor tells us, on another occasion:A liberaleducation is an artificial education which has not only prepared a manto escape the great evils of disobedience to natural laws, but hastrained him to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards which Naturescatters with as free a hand as her penalties. That man, I think,(shall we not include woman also, on his own showing as above?) hashad a liberal education who has been so trained in youth that his bodyis the ready servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure allthe work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect is aclear, cold logic engine, with all its parts in equal strength and insmooth working order, ready, like a steam engine, to be turned to everykind of work, and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of themind; whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the great and fundamentaltruths of Nature, and of the laws of her operations; one who, no stuntedascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose passions are trained tocome to heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience; whohas learned to love all beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to hate allvileness, and to respect others as himself.Such an one, and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education, forhe is as completely as a man can be in harmony with Nature. He will makethe best of her, and she of him. They will get on together rarely; sheas his ever beneficent mother, he as her mouthpiece, her conscious self,her minister, and interpreter._Id._ (Essay on a Liberal Education.)        6._In strength alike the sturdy comrades train_; ...How largely strength is simply a matter of training may be instanced bya case or two:The results of practice and training from childhood on the bodilydevelopment can be seen in female acrobats and circus riders, who couldcompete with any man in courage, daring, dexterity, and strength, andwhose performances are frequently astonishing.Bebel (Woman, p. 126).I am a medical man. I have spent several years in Africa, and have seenhuman nature among tribes whose habits are utterly unlike those ofEurope. I had been accustomed to believe that the _muscular_ system ofwomen is necessarily feebler than that of men, and perhaps I might havedogmatised to that effect; but, to my astonishment, I found the Africanwomen to be as strong as our men.... Not only did I see the proof of itin their work and in the weights which they lifted, but on examiningtheir arms I found them large and hard beyond all my previousexperience. On the contrary, I saw the men of these tribes to be weak,their muscles small and flabby. Both facts are accounted for by thehabits of the people. The men are lazy in the extreme; all the hard workis done by the women.(_Westminster Review_, Oct., 1865, p. 355.)Les femmes Sphakiotes ne le cdent en rien aux hommes pour la vigueuret lnergie.

In this context it is pleasant to find in the newspapers such anote as the following:  The frost continued throughout West Cheshire yesterday, and skating  on rather rough ice was largely enjoyed. At Eaton, where the Duke of  Westminster is entertaining a party, the guests had a hockey match on  the frozen fish-pond in front of the hall. The players, who kept the  game up with spirit for over an hour, included the Duchess of  Westminster, the Marquis and Marchioness of Ormonde, Lady Beatrice and  Lady Constance Buller, Lord Arthur Grosvenor, Lord Gerald Grosvenor,  Lady Margaret and Lady Mary Grosvenor, Captain and Mrs. Cawley, Hon.  Mrs. Norman Grosvenor, Hon. Mrs. Thomas Grosvenor, General Julian  Hall, and party.(_Manchester Courier_, 12th Jan., 1892.)Later on in the year we read in the journal _Woman_:  At the Marlow Regatta an extremely pretty girl in navy serge, built  Eton fashion, was a Miss , who wore as an under-bodice a full vest  of shaded yellow Indian silk. Her prowess with the oar is the cause of  daily admiration to the Marlowites.Again, on August 15th, 1892, the _Manchester Evening Mail_ has thefollowing:  An ailing navvy, who has been engaged in some works near  Versailles, was a few days ago admitted to a hospital in that town.  Before the sick person had long been in the institution it was  discovered that the apparent navvy was a woman. The superintendent  of the hospital was not in the least surprised on hearing of the  transformation scene, for it appears that he is accustomed to deal  with many woman patients who enter the hospital in male attire. It is  common in the district (says a Paris correspondent) for robust women  to don mens garb in order to obtain remunerative employment as  navvies, porters, farm labourers, road menders, or assistants to  bricklayers, masons, and builders. It has long been established that  the average Frenchwoman of town or country has as great a capacity for  work either in counting-houses, shops, fields, or farms as her lord  and master has for laziness and lolling in the cafs, playing  dominoes, and smoking cigarettes.On the preceding day, August 14th, 1892, the St. Petersburg journalsreported that:  Ces jours-ci sera rig  Sbastopol le monument lev en lhonneur  des Femmes de cette ville qui, en 1854, ont construit seules une  batterie contre les troupes allies. Cest une pyramide taille en  granit dune hauteur de cinquante pieds. Sur un ct est crit en  lettres dor: Cest ici que se trouvait la batterie des Femmes; sur  lautre face les mots suivants sont gravs: A cet endroit, en 1854,  les Femmes de Sbastopol ont construit une batterie. Le jour de  linauguration de ce monument nest pas encore fix. Limpratrice se  fera reprsenter  linauguration par un grand-duc.And, in October, 1892, the sporting newspapers recorded that:  Women are gradually coming to the fore as bicycle riders. Miss  Dudley, a well-known rider, has just accomplished a feat which would  have seemed wonderful for any rider not long ago. She has ridden from  a spot near Hitchin to Lincoln, a distance of 100 miles, in little  more than seven hours, or at the average speed of about fourteen miles  an hour. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are well-known as tandem riders, and they  have won many races together; but this is, perhaps, the first recorded  instance of a woman cyclist holding her own so well, unaided, in a  long road ride.See also The Lancashire pit-brow women, Note XVIII., 8.           7._Of differing sex no thought inept intrudes_,I have conversed, as man with man, with medical men on anatomicalsubjects, and compared the proportions of the human body withartistsyet such modesty did I meet with that I was never reminded byword or look of my sex, and the absurd rules which make modesty apharisaical cloak of weakness.Mary Wollstonecraft (The Rights ofWoman, p. 278).As a careful observer remarks, true modesty lies in the entire absenceof thought upon the subject. Among medical students and artists the nudecauses no extraordinary emotion; indeed, Flaxman asserted that thestudents in entering the Academy seemed to hang up their passions alongwith their hats.Westermarck (History of Human Marriage, p. 194)._Id._... This is strikingly exemplified in the curious conversationrecorded in Lylies Euphues and his England, edit. 1605, 4to,signature XZ 2, where young unmarried people of both sexes meettogether and discuss without reserve the ticklish metaphysics of love.But though treading on such slippery ground, it is remarkable that theynever, even by allusion, fall into grossness. Their delicate proprietyis not improbably the effect of their liberty.Buckle (Common-placeBook, No. 856).       8._Their purpose calmly sure all errant aim excludes_.We point to a present remedy for undergraduate excesses, which, restingon the soundest theory, has also the demonstration of unquestioned fact.It is co-education. Cease to separate human beings because of sex. Theyare conjoined in the family, in the primary and grammar schools, insociety, and, after the degree rewards four years of monastic studentexistence, in the whole career of life.Throw open the doors of Harvard to women on equal terms, absorb theannexe into the college proper, and as the night follows the day,scholarship will rise, and dissipation fall by the law of gravitation.The moral atmosphere will find immediate purification, and the dailyassociation of brothers and sisters in intellectual pursuits impart abreadth of view which is an education in itself. The professors may thenbe left safely to their themes, John Harvards statue may cease to dreaddefilement, the regent will find his censorial duties fully asperfunctory as he seems to have made them in the past, and characterwill crowd out profligacy.William Lloyd Garrison (in _WomansJournal_, Boston, U.S., 6th February, 1892).Whatsoever is ultimately decided by the wisdom of ages to be the bestpossible form of culture for one human nature, must be so for another,for one common humanity lies deeper in all and is more essential in eachthan any difference.Sophia Jex-Blake, M.D.                                 XLVI.                     3.... _impartial range_ ...Preparation in this direction is going steadily forward, not only in theWestern hemisphere, but in the Eastern. It is announced (in August,1892) that  Lady students at the five Universities in Switzerland number 224.  Berne is the most popular, with 78 female undergraduates; Zurich has  70; Geneva 70; the new University of Lausanne has five; and Basle one.  The medical faculty is in most favour with the female students, and  counts 157 of the whole number; the philosophical faculty follows with  62; five prefer the faculty of jurisprudence; the theological faculty  has not yet been invaded by the sex. More than half of the female  students, 116, are Russians, 21 Germans, 21 Swiss, 11 Americans, nine  Austrians, seven Bulgarians, four English, three Roumanians, and three  from the Turkish Empire, all of whom are young Armenian ladies.                      4.... _wider wisdom_ ...Such wider wisdomwithout the preliminary sufferingas the poet hadattained to, when he wrote: I have climbed to the snows of Age, and I gaze at a field in the Past,   Where I sank with the body at times in the sloughs of a low desire; But I hear no yelps of the beast, and the man is quiet at last,   As he stands on the heights of his life with a glimpse of a height      that is higher.                 Tennyson (By an Evolutionist)._Id._... _juster ethics, teach_; ...For we see that it is possible to interpret the ideals of ethicalprogress, through love and sociality, co-operation and sacrifice, not asmere utopias contradicted by experience, but as the highest expressionsof the central evolutionary process of the natural world.... The olderbiologists have been primarily anatomists, analysing and comparing theform of the organism, separate and dead; however incompletely, we havesought rather to be physiologists, studying and interpreting the highestand intensest activity of things living.... It is much for our purenatural history to recognise that creations final law is notstruggle, but love.Geddes and Thomson (The Evolution of Sex, pp.312, 313).        5; 6._Conformed to claims of intellect and need,               The tempered numbers of their high-born breed_;There is a problem creeping gradually forward upon us, a problem thatwill have to be solved in time, and that is the steady increase ofpopulation.... I believe that with the emancipation of women we shallsolve this problem now. Fewer children will be born, and those that areborn will be of a higher and better physique than the present order ofmen. The ghastly abortions, which in many parts pass muster nowadays,owing to the unnatural physical conditions of society, as men, women,and children, will make room for a nobler and higher order of beings,who will come to look upon the production of mankind in a diseased ordegraded state as a wickedness and unpardonable crime, against which allmen and women should fight and strive.Lady Florence Dixie (Gloriana,p. 137)._Id._... And Mrs. Mona Caird says:If the new movement had no othereffect than to rouse women to rebellion against the madness of largefamilies, it would confer a priceless benefit on humanity.(_NineteenthCentury_, May, 1892.)_Id._... To bring a child into existence without a fair prospect ofbeing able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction andtraining for its mind, is a moral crime, both against the unfortunateoffspring and against society.... The fact itself of causing theexistence of a human being, is one of the most responsible actions inthe range of human life. To undertake this responsibilityto bestow alife which may be either a curse or a blessingunless the being on whomit is bestowed will have at least the ordinary chances of a desirableexistence, is a crime against that being. And in a country eitherover-peopled, or threatened with being so, to produce children, beyond avery small number, with the effect of reducing the reward of labour bytheir competition, is a serious offence against all who live by theremuneration of their labour.J. S. Mill (Liberty, Chap. V.)._Id._... A. Dumas fils draws a true and piteous picture in which thiselement of the unintelligent overproduction of human beings has thelargest share:Il y a, et cest la masse, les femmes du peuple et de la campagne suantdu matin au soir pour gagner le pain quotidien, faisant ainsi ce quefaisaient leurs mres, et mettant au monde, sans savoir pourquoi nicomment, des filles qui,  leur tour, feront comme elles,  moins que,plus jolies, et par consquent plus insoumises, elles ne sortent dugroupe par le chemin tentant et facile de la prostitution, mais o lelabeur est encore plus rude. Le dos courb sous le travail du jour,regardant la terre quand elles marchent, domptes par la misre,vaincues par lhabitude, asservies aux besoins des autres, ces cratures forme de femme ne supposent que leur condition puisse tre modifiejamais. Elles nont pas le temps, elles nont jamais eu la facult depenser et de rflchir;  peine un souhait vague et bientt refoul dequelque chose de mieux! Quand la charge est trop lourde elles tombent,elles geignent comme des animaux terrasss, elles versent de grosseslarmes  lide de laisser leurs petits sans ressources, ou ellesremercient instinctivement la mort, cest--dire le repos dont elles onttant besoin. (Les Femmes qui Tuent, etc., p. 101.)_Id._... And again, the advanced biological writers say:The statistician will doubtless long continue his fashion ofconfidently estimating the importance and predicting the survival ofpopulations from their quantity and rate of reproduction alone; but atall this, as naturalists, we can only scoff. Even the most conventionalexponent of the struggle for existence among us knows, with thebarbarian conquerors of old, that the thicker the grass, the easier itis mown, that the wolf cares not how many the sheep may be. It is themost individuated type that prevails in spite, nay, in another sense,positively because of its slower increase; in a word, the survival of aspecies or family depends not primarily upon quantity, but upon quality.The future is not to the most numerous population, but to the mostindividuated....Apart from the pressure of population, it is time to be learning (1)That the annual child-bearing still so common, is cruelly exhaustive tothe maternal life, and this often in actual duration as well as quality;(2) That it is similarly injurious to the standard of offspring; andhence, (3) That an interval of two clear years between births (somegyncologists even go as far as three) is due alike to mother andoffspring. (It is to be noted that this period of three years ispostulated as a necessity for the well-being of the offspring; it is byno means a recommendation to even a triennial maternity on the part ofthe mother, who is indeed to be, in all fulness, free mistress of herpersons sacred plan, with a duty to herself, as well as to her child).It is time, therefore, as we heard a brave parson tell his flocklately, to have done with that blasphemous whining which constantlytries to look at a motherless (ay, or sometimes even fatherless) crowdof puny infants as a dispensation of mysterious providence. Let usfrankly face the biological facts, and admit that such cases usuallyillustrate only the extreme organic nemesis of intemperance andimprovidence, and these of a kind far more reprehensible than thoseactions to which common custom applies the names, since they arespecies-regarding vices, and not merely self-regarding ones, as theothers at least primarily are....It seems to us, however, essential to recognise that the ideal to besought after is not merely a controlled rate of increase, but regulatedmarried lives.... We would urge, in fact, the necessity of an ethicalrather than of a mechanical prudence after marriage, of a temperancerecognised to be as binding on husband and wife as chastity on theunmarried.... Just as we would protest against the dictum of falsephysicians who preach indulgence rather than restraint, so we mustprotest against regarding artificial means of preventing fertilisationas adequate solutions of sexual responsibility. After all, the solutionis primarily one of temperance. It is no new nor unattainable ideal toretain, throughout married life, a large measure of that self-controlwhich must always form the organic basis of the enthusiasm and idealismof lovers.Geddes and Thomson (The Evolution of Sex, Chap. XX.).  As a fitting exemplification of the words of the parson above  narrated, compare the following verbatim extract from a conversation  in this year of grace 1892. The  referred to is a man about 35,  middle-class, and of good education (!) The same description would  also apply to the speaker, who said, Poor  is a brave fellow, and  keeps up his head in the worst of luck. He has a lot of home troubles;  he has lost three children, and his wife always has a bad time at the  birth of each baby.  No word of sympathy for the wife and mother, or even of recognition  that it was really _she_ who bore the pain at each bad time. As the  children left alive still numbered two at the time of the speech, the  whole incident can but implyon the part of both actor and speakerthe  hideous, even if unconscious, inhumanity so widely prevalent. Never  will high-born breed be attained till such action of low-bred  intellect is reprobated and amended; in accordance with the enunciated  truth, that:Especially in higher organisms, a distinction must obviously be drawnbetween the period at which it is possible for males and females tounite in fertile sexual union, and the period at which such union willnaturally occur or will result in the fittest offspring.Geddes andThomson (_op. cit._, p. 243).     7, 8._Not overworn with childward pain and care,            The motherand the racerobuster health shall share_.It is not the true purpose of any intellectual organism to live solelyto give birth to succeeding organisms; its duty is also to live for itsown happiness and well-being. Indeed, in so doing, it will be acting inone of the most certain ways to ensure that faculty and possession ofhappiness that it aims to secure for its progeny.Ben Elmy (Studies inMaterialism, Chap. III.)._Id._... Even the placid and precisian American poet bears strong, ifinvoluntary, testimony to the evil and wrong of the non-cultured anduntempered begetting of children:             She wedded a man unlearned and poor,               And many children played round her door;             But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain               Left their traces on heart and brain.

Mr. Andrew Lang also promises us a world that is glad andclean, and not overthronged and not overdriven.(Introduction toElizabethan Songs.)_Id._... _Justice never loses sight of self._... The language ofJustice is to Me and to You; or to You and to Me. ... We have tolearn, for the action and spirit worthy of the coming time, that womanis never to sacrifice herself to a man, but, when needful, to the_Manhood_ she hopes or desires to develop in him. In this she will alsoattain her own development. But after the hour when her faith in thehope of worthy results fails her (reason instructing her nobleraffections by holding candidly in view all the premises, past, present,and future), she is bound by all her higher obligations to bring thatcareer, whether it be of the daughter, sister, mother, wife, or friend,to a close. For the inferior cannot possibly be worth the sacrifice ofthe superior. True self-sacrifice, which necessarily involves thetemporary descent of the nobler to the less noblethe higher to theloweris made only when the lower is elevated, improved, carried forwardin its career, thereby.Eliza W. Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol.II., p. 149)._Id._... I have urged on woman independence of man, not that I do notthink the sexes mutually needed by one another; but because in womanthis fact has led to an excessive devotion which has cooled love,degraded marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should beto itself or the other.... Woman, self-controlled, would never beabsorbed by any relations; it would be only an experience to her as toman. It is a vulgar error that love, a love to woman, is her wholeexistence; she is also born for truth and love in their universalenergy.Margaret Fuller Ossoli (The Woman of the Nineteenth Century)._Id._... Professor Alfred Russell Wallace has written an article,concerning part of which Mr. W. T. Stead rightly says: It is ascientific reinforcement of the cause of the emancipation of women, andshows that progress of the cause of female enfranchisement is identifiedwith the progress of humanity.(_Review of Reviews_, Vol. V., p. 177.)Professor Wallace says:When such social changes have been effected that no woman will becompelled, either by hunger, isolation, or social compulsion, to sellherself, whether in or out of wedlock, and when all women alike shallfeel the refining influence of a true humanising education, of beautifuland elevating surroundings, and of a public opinion which shall befounded on the highest aspirations of their age and country, the resultwill be a form of human selection which will bring about a continuousadvance in the average status of the race. Under such conditions, allwho are deformed either in body or mind, though they may be able to leadhappy and contented lives, will, as a rule, leave no children to inherittheir deformity. Even now we find many women who never marry becausethey have never found the man of their ideal. When no woman will becompelled to marry for a bare living or for a comfortable home, thosewho remain unmarried from their own free choice will certainly increase,while many others, having no inducement to an early marriage, will waittill they meet with a partner who is really congenial to them.In such a reformed society the vicious man, the man of degraded tasteor feeble intellect, will have little chance of finding a wife, and hisbad qualities will die out with himself. The most perfect and beautifulin body and mind will, on the other hand, be most sought, and,therefore, be most likely to marry early, the less highly endowed later,and the least gifted in any way the latest of all, and this will be thecase with both sexes.From this varying age of marriage, as Mr. Galton has shown, there willresult a more rapid increase of the former than of the latter, and thiscause continuing at work for successive generations will, at length,bring the average man to be the equal of those who are now among themore advanced of the race.Human Progress, Past and Present (_Arena_,Jan., 1892).

Chauveau accordingly consecrated eightysubjects to his purpose. The animal, he says, is fixed upon a table.An incision is made on its back about fourteen inches long; the vertebrare opened with the help of a chisel, mallet, and pincers, and thespinal marrow is exposed. (No mention is made of ansthetics, which ofcourse would nullify the experimenters object of studying theexcitability of the spinal marrow, and the convulsions _and pain_produced by that excitability.)

We do not possessourselves of all of Natures secrets by cutting up her tissues andfabrics, neither by the keenest inspection of their ultimate atoms,whether fluid or solid. There are some truths withheld from theinvestigator, however brave, patient, and nice his methods and means,which are given up, in due time, to the truth-seer, without any methodor means, save the intuitive faculty and its unambitious, guilelesssurrender to the service offered it. Such, it is at least possible, wemay find has been Natures dealing in this occult department.Eliza W.Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol. I., pp. 47, 50).                                  LIV.          1._True science finds its own by kindlier quest_.Science is of the utmost importance to mankind, but the last degree ofimportance cannot be said to attach to all its minute discoveries, andwhere, as in physiology, the investigation becomes inhuman, there itought to stop. It ought to stop for our own sakes if from no othermotive, for the torturing of animals on the chance that it may suggestthe means of alleviating some of our own pains helps to blunt thosesensibilities which afford us some of our purest pleasures. Animals arenot our equals in all things, but they seem to be at any rate our equalsin the sense of pain. The want of imagination may deprive it in theircase of some of its poignancy, but on the other hand they have none ofthe supports which we derive from reason and sympathy, from thetenderness of friendship and the consolations of religion. With them itis pure, unmitigated, unsolaced suffering. Our duties to them form aneglected chapter in the code of ethics, but we ought not to torturethem, and there are many who will maintain that the obligation isabsolute. Life is no doubt valuable, but it is not everything. It ismore than meat, as the body is more than raiment, but it is not morethan humanity. There are occasions on which it has to be risked, andthere are terms on which men of honour and patriotism would hold itworthless. The doctrine that we may subject the lower animals toincredible suffering on the possibility that it may save ourselves froman additional pang is of a selfish and degrading tendency. It helps tolower the moral ideal and to weaken the springs of heroism in humancharacter. We owe it to ourselves to keep clear of this peril. Naturesurrounds us with limitations. Here is one which all that is best andnoblest in us sets up, and it is more sacred than those over which wehave no control. We refuse to torture other sentient creatures in orderthat we may live.Dr. Henry Dunckley (_Manchester Guardian_, August9th, 1892).The above noble pronouncement, with its conclusion, is instinct with thespirit of _true_ science (which repudiates with disdain and horror thehypocritical pseudo-science of a ghastly and demoralising study andpursuit of cruelty),the _true_ science which is one with love, becauseit refuses the acceptance of life itself on terms of outrage to love.See Note LXI., 3.              4.... _a keener lens of mans own brain_.Observation is perhaps more powerful an organon than either experimentor empiricism.Richard Jefferies (Story of My Heart, p. 162)._Id._... It is well that some English physicists of the fullestscientific impulse and effort are revolted at the inhuman and bootlesscruelty of the foreign medical schools which masquerades as scientificresearch. Is it not possibly something more than a coincidence thatvivisectionists in general exhibit an aversion to the equality of woman,and that vivisection flourishes more unrestrainedly where her positionand influence are less recognised; _i.e._, in plain words,in a lowercivilisation?Mr. Lawson Tait says, with the indignation of a truly scientific mind atthese methods of science falsely so called:  For one, as intimately and widely concerned in the application of  human knowledge for the saving of human life and the relief of human  suffering as anyone can be, or as anyone has ever been, I say I am  grateful for the restrictive legislation. Let me give one brief  illustration of my most recent experience in this matter as one of  hundreds which confirm me in my determination persistently to oppose  the introduction into England of what passes for science in Germany.  Some few years ago I began to deal with one of the most dreadful  calamities to which humanity is subject by means of an operation which  had been scientifically proposed nearly two hundred years ago. I mean  ectopic gestation. The _rationale_ of the proposed operation was fully  explained about fifty years ago, but the whole physiology of the  normal process and the pathology of the perverted one were obscured  and misrepresented by a French physiologists experiments on rabbits  and dogs. Nothing was done, and at least ninety-five per cent. of the  victims of this catastrophe were allowed to die.  I went outside the experimentalists conclusions, went back to the  true science of the old pathologist and of the surgeon of 1701, and  performed the operation in scores of cases with almost uniform  success. My example was immediately followed throughout the world, and  during the last five or six years hundreds if not thousands of womens  lives have been saved, whilst for nearly forty years the simple road  to this gigantic success was closed by the folly of a vivisector....  Views such as mine are those of a minority of my professional  brethren, and are generally sneered at as those of a crank. But my  reply to this is that they form the new belief, that of the coming  generation, and that not one in fifty of the bulk of my present  brethren have ever seriously gone into the question, and probably have  never seen a single experiment on a living animal.  My address as the Surgical Orator of 1890, when the British Medical  Association met in this town, was mainly directed to the mischievous  system of so-called scientific training, of purely German origin and  thoroughly repugnant to our English tastes and our English  common-sense.  It is therefore a satisfactory matter to know that the Council of  Masons College would have none of it, and that the governing body of  the new University College of Nottingham has recently decided  similarly. The Medical School of Queens College is now united  entirely with the Science School of Masons College; but we, of  Masons College, have had the direction of the science teaching of the  Medical School for several years, we have had no German scientific  methods, and our success has not diminished thereby one atomon the  contrary.Lawson Tait, F.R.C.S., _President of Masons Science  College, Birmingham_ (The Discussion on Vivisection at the Church  Congress, October, 1892).At the Congress, as above, Professor Horsley made aspersions on MissFrances Power Cobbe, as to statements concerning Vivisection in herwork, The Nine Circles. The professor declared some of the reportedcruel experiments to have been painless, owing to the victims beingunder the influence of ansthetics. In reply to the attack, thefollowing preliminary letter from Miss Cobbe was then published:                      TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.  SIR,Professor Horsleys criticism on the above workplanned and  compiled by my directiondemands from me a careful reply, which I  shall endeavour to give as soon as may be possible at this distance  from the books whence the impugned passages are derived. I shall be  much surprised if the hocus pocus of the sham ansthetic _curare_ with  ineffective applications of genuine chloroform do not once more  illustrate the curse of vivisectible animals, and if the results of  the experiments in question, whatever were their worth, would not, in  most cases, have been vitiated had real and absolute ansthesia been  produced in the victims. Should a small number of the experiments  cited in the Nine Circles prove, however, to have been performed on  animals in an entirely painless state, I shall, while withdrawing them  with apologies from a forthcoming new edition of the book, take care  at the same time to call attention to the multitude of other  experiments, home and foreign, therein recordede.g., baking to death,  poisoning, starving, creating all manner of diseases, inoculating in  the eyes, dissecting out and irritating the exposed nerves, causing  the brain of cats to run like cream, etc., about which no room for  doubt as to the unassuaged agony of the animal can possibly exist.Miss Cobbe concludes by a sharp, but just, criticism on her critic, andwith an acute diagnosis of the learned vivisectionists own condition:  The tone of Dr. Horsleys remarks against me personally will probably  inspire those who know me and the history of my connexion with the  anti-vivisection cause with an amused sense of the difficulty wherein  the Professor must have found himself when, instead of argument in  defence of vivisection, he thus turned to abuse the plaintiffs  attorney. For myself I gladly accept such abuse (or mere bluster) as  evidence that the consciences even of eminent vivisectors are, like  their victims nerves, imperfectly under the influence of the  scientific ansthesia, and remain still sensitive to the  heart-pricking charge which I bring against them, of cowardly cruelty  to defenceless creatures.                   I am, Sir, yours,                   FRANCES POWER COBBE.                   Hengwrt, Dolgelly, Oct. 8th, 1892. A further newspaper correspondence concerning The Nine Circles, awork from which some of the foregoing notes on vivisection are copied,has gone on while Woman Free is passing through the press; thevivisectors saying that certain of the incidents transcribed in TheNine Circles are without the announcement that in some cases anansthetic had been administered prior to the act of living anatomy,otherwise admittedly true in every detail. The vivisectors lay whatstress they can on the omissions; indeed, their principal advocate hasmade use of a grossness of imputation and a coarseness of invective thataugurs ill for any gentleness of treatment or purpose being existent inthe organism of such an operator.Yet, in truth, it is not a matter of surpassing import whether theassertion of the operation (alone) being conducted under an anstheticbe indubitable, since the after-consequences of pain or incommodity hadto be endured by the victim without ansthetics. What initialchloroforming could ward off the constant after-suffering attendant onthe incubation of the disease for the creation of which the operationhad been performed, a period acknowledgedly often lasting for weeks, andterminated only by deaths mercy? Or what medicament could ansthetisethe impotent yearningto feed her starving puppyof a poor mother dogwhose mammary glands had been excised, even if the operation had beencarried out under chloroform? Mr. Edward Berdoe, M.R.C.S., reproducesand reprobates the incident with horror in the _Times_ of Oct. 27,1892:  Professor Goltz amputated the breast of the mother of a puppy nursing  her young ... who unceasingly licked the living puppy with the same  tenderness as an uninjured dog might do.Most gladly may we turn to the words and ways of worthier seekers aftertruth. Professor Lawson Tait is reported by the _Standard_, 28th Oct.,1892, as saying at a meeting the previous day:  Vivisection was a survival from medival times. It could not be  justified by any results that it had produced. In days when they could  tell the composition of the atmosphere of Orion by means of the  spectroscope, it was a disgrace that men should resort to vivisection,  instead of perfecting other and more humane means of research.There speaks true science. And, on a later occasion, Mr. Lawson Taitquotes the celebrated anatomist, Sir Charles Bell (who had been falselyclaimed as an advocate of vivisection), as saying, on page 217 of thesecond volume of his great work on the Nervous System, published in1839:  ... a survey of what has been attempted of late years in physiology  will prove that the opening of living animals has done more to  perpetuate error than to confirm the just views taken from the study  of anatomy and natural motions.... For my own part I cannot believe  that Providence should intend that the secrets of nature are to be  discovered by means of cruelty, and I am sure that those who are  guilty of protracted cruelties do not possess minds capable of  appreciating the laws of nature.(The _Times_, Nov. 8th, 1892, p. 3.)The views of Charles Bell and Lawson Tait are in striking andencouraging coincidence with verses LIII., LIV., and LV.To women peculiarly it belongs to oppose the doctrines and methods ofvivisectionists, for to the practitioners of that school were due thearguments or assumptions which sufficed to introduce for a while intoour country the vile system of according a licence to male dissolutenessand female subjectionunder a pretext of public morality andscientific sanctionknown on the continent as the police des murs,and in sundry Naval and Military stations of England and Ireland as theContagious Diseases Acts.

From all we know of the laws of life and its development itwould appear one of the foolishest things on earth for men to fancy thatthey can debase the intellect lobes of women, and at the same time exalttheir own.

To take a fewscattered instances from the latter, Shakespeare says:             ... however we do praise ourselves,             Our fancies are more giddy and infirm,             More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won             Than womens are.                       (Twelfth Night, Act II., Sc. 4.)Goethe says pungently (in Wilhelm Meisters Apprenticeship): Peopleridicule learned women and dislike even women who are well informed,probably because it is considered impolite to put so many ignorant mento shame.As our own plain-spoken Sydney Smith has said, in his essay on FemaleEducation:It is natural that men who are ignorant themselves, shouldview, with some degree of jealousy and alarm, any proposal for improvingthe education of women.A ludicrously pitiful modern-day instance of the jealous ignorance orignorant jealousy to which Goethe and Sydney Smith make reference, isafforded by a seriously-written leading article in No. 545 of the_Christian Commonwealth_, a London weekly newspaper, under date of 24thMarch, 1892:  The Woman question will not down. She is asserting herself in every  direction, and generally with considerable force. In America she is  positively alarming the lords of creation by her rapid progress in  educational matters. She is actually outrunning the men in the race  for intellectual attainments. And this fact is becoming so evident,  and so prominent, that a new problem is being evolved from it. This  is, how are the finely educated young women of America to find  congenial husbands? It is assumed by some writers that already there  is a great disparity between the culture of the young men and young  women, and that every year the chasm between them is becoming deeper  and wider. This is a truly lamentable state of things, but the woman  movement in this country is likely to take a more practical course.  The agitation of the question of Woman Suffrage may bring about a  reaction against her excessive culture. If woman is permitted to enter  the cesspool of politics, it is probable she will not be very long  distressed with an overplus of those qualities which are just now  endangering her conjugal felicity in the United States....It is refreshing and consolatory to revert from such verbiage to whatSir Humphrey Davy said (Lectures, 1810 and 1811): It has been toomuch the custom to endeavour to attach ridicule to the literary andscientific acquisitions of women. Let _them_ make it disgraceful for mento be ignorant, and ignorance will perish.To Shakespeare and Goethe may be added the corroboration of Frenchintellect:Nest-il pas vident que Molire, dans ses _Femmes Savantes_ na pasattaqu linstruction, ltude, mais le pdantisme, comme, dans son_Tartuffe_, il avait attaqu non la vraie dvotion, mais lhypocrisie?Nest-ce pas Molire lui-mme qui a crit ce beau vers: Et je veuxquune femme ait des clarts _de tout_?Monseigneur Dupanloup, EvquedOrlans (Femmes Savantes et Femmes Studieuses, 1868, p. 8).Cest  Condorcet et non pas  Jean Jacques, comme on le croitgnralement, quappartient linitiative des rformes proposes danslducation et la condition des femmes.Daniel Stern (Hist. de laRvolution de 1848, Vol. II, p. 185).Quand la loi franaise(shall we not say also every other?)dclarela femme infrieure  lhomme ce nest jamais pour librer la femme dundevoir vis--vis de lhomme ou de la socit, cest pour armer lhommeou la socit dun droit de plus contre elle. Il nest jamais venu lide de la loi de tenir compte de la faiblesse de la femme dans lesdiffrents dlits quelle peut commettre; au contraire, la loi enabuse.A. Dumas fils (Les Femmes qui Tuent, etc., p. 204).Mill says:There is nothing which men so easily learn as thisself-worship; all privileged persons, and all privileged classes havehad it. And he also speaks of a timewhen satires on women were invogue, and men thought it a clever thing to insult women for being whatmen made them.(Subjection of Women, pp. 76, 77).We have seen (Note XLV., 5) how Professor Huxley postulates scientifictraining equally for girls and boys; he has also said:Emancipategirls. Recognise the fact that they share the senses, perceptions,feelings, reasoning powers, emotions of boys, and that the mind of theaverage girl is less different from that of the average boy, than themind of one boy is from that of another; so that whatever argumentjustifies a given education for all boys, justifies its application togirls as well.(Emancipation, _Black and White_.)Balzac asserted: A woman who has received a masculine educationpossesses the most brilliant and fertile qualities, with which to securethe happiness of her husband and herself.(Physiologie du Mariage,Mditation XI.).But the instances are innumerable where the intellect of higher menexpressly or unconsciously rebukes the jealous sexual conceit of theirless intelligent brethren. Dr. Bonavia says, very tersely:The fact is,many men dont like the idea of being surpassed or even equalled bywomen. They stupidly feel their dignity wounded. This jealousy, however,is not only extremely contemptible and unjust, but disastrous to thetrue interests of the race, for men have mothers _as well as women_, andimbecilitythe result of atrophied frontal lobesis just as likely to betransmitted to the one sex as to the other, as far as we yet know. Justsee the injustice of mens jealousy in matters of intellect. Onlyrecently the talent of Miss Ormerodan entomologist who can hold her own_anywhere_ on earthwas kept under by the Royal Agricultural Society._She_ did the entomological work, and made the discoveries, while _they_took the credit. In their reports they did not even mention _her_ namein connection with her own work!A more contemptible proceeding, itwould appear, has never been brought to light, in the struggle of thesexes, if that case has been correctly reported.(Womans FrontalLobes.)Bebel treats this jealousy with a fine irony in his exposition of themotives which induce most medical professors, and indeed the professorsof every faculty, to oppose women students:They regard the admissionof women as synonymous with the degradation of science (!) which couldnot but lose its prestige in the eyes of the enlightened (!) multitudeif it appeared that the female brain was capable of grasping problemswhich had hitherto only been revealed to the elect of the oppositesex.(_Op. cit._, p. 132.)Had Bebel recorded masculine mercenary considerations, rather than shammisgivings as to the interests of science, his sarcasm would have beenvery grim truth. Indeed, what is sometimes called the loaves andfishes argument is at the root of most of this masculine jealousy whichcloaks itself under a pretension of tender consideration for womansdelicacy. To cite Bebel again: Another objection is that it is unseemlyto admit women to medical lectures, to operations, and deliveries, sideby side with male students. If men see nothing indecent in studying andexamining female patients in the presence of nurses and other femalepatients, it is difficult to understand why it should become so throughthe presence of female students.(_Op. cit._, p. 132.) And as to theactual fitness of women for exercising the profession of medicine orsurgery:Women always improve when the men begin to show signs of failing,were the words of a distinguished physician and surgeon, who had seenyears of service on a remote wintry station of the army. I have hadfellows brought to me to have the leg amputatedperhaps bothclose tothe body, and never anywhere in Paris, London, or New York, saw I bettersurgeons assistants than some of our women made, especially the Sistersof Charity, of whom we had a few at the post, for three or four years.Heads as clear as a silver bell; hands steady and unshrinking as agranite rock, yet with a touch as light as a spring leaf; foot quick andindefatigable, whether the time was noonday or midnight; memory perfect;tenderness for the sufferer unfailing. Talk about love, courage,fortitude, and endurance in your sex! I tell you, he added, with aneedless affirmation at this point, they seem to be nothing else, whenthese are most wanted, and the man who doubts them is an ass.Eliza W.Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 157). See also Note XXIX., 8._Id._ ... Here may fittingly follow the report of a trained masculinejudgment as to womans ability in yet a further professionthat of thelaw:At the recent opening of the Southern California College of Law, at LosAngeles, John W. Mitchell, the president, in his lecture upon The Studyof the Law, spoke of the utility of women studying law, in thefollowing language:  This part of this discourse it is believed would be radically  incomplete without calling attention to one other and particular class  of persons who need an insight into the rudiments of lawwhich class,  it seems, has also been neglected by those occupying a like position  to my ownI mean the women. He is, indeed, blind to the signs of the  times who does not recognise the expanding field of womens work, and  their increased influence in the professions as well as in the fine  arts. That women are entering the lists with men, in behalf of  themselves and womankind, is well; for they must make up their minds  to take up the task of urging the reforms they need, and must solve  the woman problem in all its bearings. Women are doing this. They are  becoming competitors with men in the pursuits of life, it is true; but  it is as much from necessity as choice. But it is not only the women  who have to labour and earn their own living who need legal knowledge  to aid them. It is more needful to the woman of property, be her  possessions but an humble home or a colossal fortune; whether she be  married or single. Women want this experience to make them cautious of  jeopardising their rights, and less confiding in business matters. The  courts are full of cases showing how women have been wrongly stripped  of their belongings. And, perhaps, if one woman had known the legal  effect of some of her acts, one of the largest fortunes ever amassed  in this State of Crsus-like wealth would not have been carried to  distant States, and there scandalously distributed amongst scheming  adventurers and lawyers, making a little Massachusetts county-seat the  theatre of one of the most remarkable contests for a fortune in the  whole annals of probate court law.  As to the professions: women were for a long time barred from them,  but now the barriers to all of them have been removed, and there is  not a profession in which women are not distinguished. They have  graduated in the sciences from most universities with the highest  honours, and have stood the same tests as the men. The law was about  the last to admit them within its precincts, and there they are  meeting with an unexpected measure of success. Not only in this, but  in other countries, there are successful women practitioners. And in  France, where the preparatory course is most arduous, and the term of  study longest, a woman recently took the highest rank over 500 men in  her graduating examinations, and during the whole six years of class  study she only lost one day from her workan example that is commended  to you students. Undoubtedly, the weight of the argument is in favour  of women studying law.(_Womens Journal_, Boston, U.S., 6th  February, 1892.)_Id._... Even the vaunted politeness and gallantry of the Frenchman isnot proof against the far more deeply-bedded masculine jealousy. M. deBlowitz, the erudite correspondent at Paris of the _Times_, reportsthat  The law students yesterday hooted down Mdlle. Jeanne Chauvin, 28  years of age, who was to have argued a thesis for a legal degree. She  had chosen as her theme, The Professions accessible to Women and the  Historical Evolution of the Economic Position of Woman in Society.  The uproar was such that the examiner postponed the ceremony _sine  die_. Mdlle. Chauvin is the first Frenchwoman who has sought a legal  degree, but two years ago a Roumanian lady went through the ordeal  without obstruction.(The _Times_, July 4, 1892.)To revert to the loaves and fishes argument, an incident now to begiven will show that medicine and the law are not the only professionsin which the objections to the equal status of the sexes are largelyprompted by a jalousie de mtier of a selfish and mercenarycharacter:The following letters have been received at Auckland from theVice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in relation to thememorial lately sent from New Zealand in favour of the opening ofdegrees to women:  DEAR PROFESSOR ALDIS,  Your very interesting memorial reached me yesterday. I still await  the explanatory letter and analysis. After receiving I will write  again.                       Yours etc.,                           JOHN PEILE,                                   Vice-Chancellor.  Christs College Lodge,      Cambridge, Nov. 2nd, 1891.  MY DEAR PROFESSOR ALDIS,  The petition of the memorial received by me from Miss Lilian Edger  and yourself, respecting degrees for women at the University of  Cambridge, and the analysis of the signatures to that memorial, have  been printed by me in the _University Reporter_, the official organ of  communication of any kind of business to the members of the Senate.  The memorial itself will be preserved in the Registry of the  University. Immediate action on this question by the Council of the  Senatethe body, with which, as you are aware, all legislation in the  University must beginis not probable. The question was raised about  three years ago; and it became at once plain that, if persevered in,  it would produce a very serious division in the ranks of those members  of the University who had all shown themselves, in the past, friends  to the highest education of women. Many of those who had earnestly  supported the admission of women to Tripos examinations, _would not  support their admission to the B.A. degree_. Into theirmostly  practicalreasons I cannot fully enter: One was the belief that  admission to B.A. must lead, in the end (in spite of any provisions  which might be introduced), to admission to M.A., and consequently to  _a share in the management of the University_; it was also apprehended  that difficulties would arise in the several colleges _with respect to  fellowships_, _etc._ I do not mention these difficulties as  insuperable. But they are felt by so many that there is, I am  persuaded, no prospect of successful action in this matter at the  present time. I shall, therefore, not myself propose anything in the  Council, nor so far has any other of the friends of womens education,  of whom there are many on the Council, given notice of any motion. At  any future time, when such a motion is made, your most influential  memorial will certainly have its due weight with the members of the  Council, and if they decide to take action, I hope also, with members  of the Senate.                                   I am, etc.,                                       JOHN PEILE,                   Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.

(_New Zealand Herald_, 5th Jan., 1892.)                         6.... _potency_ ...The Brain is different from all other organs of the body. It is often amass of structural potentialities rather than of fully-developed nervetissues. Some of its elements, viz., those concerned withbest-established instinctive operations, naturally go on to their fulldevelopment without the aid of extrinsic stimuli; others, however, andlarge tracts of these, seem to progress to such developments only underthe influence of suitable stimuli. Hence natural aptitudes and potenciesof the most subtle order may never be manifested by multitudes ofpersons, for want of the proper stimuli and practice capable ofperfecting the development and functional activity of those regions ofthe brain whose action is inseparably related to the mental phenomena inquestion.Dr. H. C. Bastian (The Brain as an Organ of Mind, p. 374).                                 LVIII.             1._Womans own soul must seek and find_ ...On women of medical education especially is the duty incumbent toinvestigate the world of biological experience in woman. They may notsit quietly down and assume that in learning all that man has to teach,they rest his equals, and that the last word has been said on thematter. They have a field of exploration, with opportunities, withimplements, and with capacities, which man cannot have. His research onsuch a question as the recognisedly most vital one of human embryologywith all its issues, can get but rare and uncertain light fromaccidental occasions, and is, moreover, simply as it were a deadanatomising; nor can he by any means reach the psychic or introspectivephase of enquiry; but woman has the live subject, body and soul, in herown organism, to study at her leisure. Does she not yet see how to graspsuch further living knowledge? But that is the very quest hereindicated. The askidian also had no strength of vision, yet we can nowtell and test the light and the components of distant spheres.There are, undoubtedly, what may be termed intelligent operationscarried on in the body unconsciously to oneself, or at any rate beyondthe present ken of ones actively perceptive and volitional faculties.Observation and recognition of these is to be striven for, and evenguidance or command of them may be ours in a worthy future. The _Times_of 27th January, 1892, reported a lecture at the Royal Institution onthe previous day by Professor Victor Horsley, in the course of which thelecturer  ... pointed out the pineal gland, which Descartes thought to be the  seat of the soul, but which was now known to be an invertebrate eye.  He also explained the functions of certain small masses of grey  matter, which are two, viz.sight and equilibration. The optic nerve  was situated close to the crura, and equilibration was subserved by  the cerebellum. After referring to the basal ganglia, Professor  Horsley admitted that as science advanced we seem to know less and  less about the specific functions of the various masses of grey  matter, and less definite views than formerly prevailed were now held  with respect to the local source of what are termed voluntary  impulses, and that of sensations.... We were still in ignorance as to  the functions of the optic thalamus, and of the corpus striatum. Those  of the cortex had to some extent been ascertained. They might be  divided into three classes, viz.movement, sensation, and what was  termed mental phenomena. But we were still in the dark as to those  portions of the brain which subserved intellectual operations, memory,  and emotional impulses. A like ignorance prevailed with respect to the  basal ganglia.What as yet unrecognised inward eyes watch over the embryo life?                     3.... _counsel helpful_ ...Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham says:In this day the most needed science tohumankind is that which will commend women to confidence in themselvesand their sex as the leading force of the coming Erathe Era ofspiritual rule and movement; in which, through them, the race isdestined to rise to a more exalted position than ever before it hasheld, and for the first time to form its dominant ties of relationshipto that world of purer action and diviner motion, which lies above thematerial one of intellectual struggle and selfish purpose wherein manhas held and exercised his long sovereignty.(Woman and Her Era, Vol.I., p. 311).                    5.... _philosophic lore_ ...The farther our knowledge advances, the greater will be the need ofrising to transcendental views of the physical world.... If theimagination had been more cultivated, if there had been a closer unionbetween the spirit of poetry and the spirit of science, naturalphilosophy would have made greater progress because natural philosopherswould have taken a higher and more successful aim, and would haveenlisted on their side a wider range of human sympathies.Buckle(Influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge)._Id._ ... _chirurgic lore_ ...The Lady Dufferin fund had already been the means of opening aschool of medicine for Indian women, who would consequently devotethemselves to the study of anatomy.

Thatwas the most extraordinary association of ideas one could ever haveimagined.Professor Vambry (Lecture to the Royal ScottishGeographical Society, Edinburgh, 20th May, 1891). Reported in the_Times_ of following day.                  8._Regent of Natures will_, ...Woman will grow into fitness for the sublime work which nature hasgiven her to do, and man through her help and persuasion willspontaneously assume the relation of a co-operator in it. Finding thatnature intends his highest good and that of his species, through theemancipation and development of woman into the fulness of her powers, hewill gratefully seek his own profit and happiness in harmonising himselfwith this method; he will honour it as natures method, and woman as itschief executor; and will joyfully find that not only individuals,families, and communities, but nations, have been wisely dependent onher, in their more advanced conditions, for the good which can come onlyfrom the most perfect, artistic, and spiritual being who inhabits ourearth.Eliza W. Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 423).

This one fact justifies the existenceand the perpetuation of the human race. Again I say that women arebetter than men; their hearts are more unreservedly given; in the web oftheir lives sorrow is inextricably woven with the greatest joys;self-sacrifice is a part of their nature, and at the behest of love andmaternity they walk willingly and joyously down to the very gates ofdeath. Is there nothing in this to excite the admiration, the adoration,of a modern reformer? Are the monk and nun superior to the father andmother?Robert Ingersoll (_North American Review_, Sept., 1890).           2._Each heir of life a wealthier bounty share_;Poets and physiologists agree in these prognostications. The keenobserver, Bastian, in his treatise on archebiosis, willingly calls tohis support an equally conscientious ally, in the following passage:We must battle on along the path of knowledge and of duty, trusting inthat natural progress towards a far distant future for the human race,such as its past history may warrant us in anticipating. For, as Mr.Wallace points out, those natural influences which have hithertopromoted mans progress still acting on his mental organisation, mustever lead to the more perfect adaptation of mans higher faculties tothe conditions of surrounding nature and to the exigencies of the socialstate, so that his mental constitution may continue to advance andimprove, till the world is again inhabited by a single, nearlyhomogeneous race, no individual of which will be inferior to the noblestspecimens of existing humanity.Dr. H.

The history of human marriage is the historyof a relation in which women have been gradually triumphing over thepassions, the prejudices, and the selfish interests of men.EdwardWestermarck (Concluding words of The History of Human Marriage).                      7._The only rivalry_ ...When woman finds her proper place in legislation, it will be foundultimately that it will be not as mans rival, but his helpmate.MabelCollins (On Womans Relation to the State).      8._How for their lineage fair still larger fate to find_.Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, had the idea of making public principleand utility predominate over private interests and affections; and onthat idea he ordained that children were not to be the property of theirparents, but of the State, which was to direct their education, anddetermine their modes of life. A better idea with the legislators of thefuture_the number of whom will be equal with that of allwholesomely-developed men and women upon the earth_will be to takefullest advantage of all natural instincts. The parents, their heartsever yearning with love for their offspring, and the community, carefulof its individual members, co-operating in placing the children underall good influences towards that development, which, being the best fortheir individual lives, will also coincide with what is best for thegeneral welfare. For this end, the experience of the past, and thehigher wisdom of their own times, will far better qualify them to judgeof fitting means and methods than we can now either surmise orsuggest.David Maxwell (Stepping-stones to Socialism, p. 15).

To open the immortal eyes       Of man inwards; into the worlds of thought: into eternity       Ever expanding the human imagination.                           William Blake (Jerusalem).             2._Their energies celestial force attain_.Les crivains du dix-huitime sicle ont sans doute rendu dimmensesservices aux Socits; mais leur philosophie base sur le sensualisme,nest pas alle plus loin que lpiderme humain.

Et nous ne sommes occups peuttre, en ce moment, qu extraire les blocs normes qui serviront plustard  quelque puissant gnie pour btir quelque glorieuxdifice.Balzac (Physiologie du Mariage, Mditation XXVI.).         3, 4._Their intermingled souls, with passion dight,                 In aspiration soar past earthly height_.As yet we are in the infancy of our knowledge. What we have done is buta speck compared to what remains to be done. For what is there that wereally know? We are too apt to speak as if we had penetrated into thesanctuary of truth and raised the veil of the goddess, when, in fact, weare still standing, coward-like, trembling before the vestibule, and notdaring, from very fear, to cross the threshold of the temple. Thehighest of our so-called laws of nature are as yet purely empirical.... They who discourse to you of the laws of nature as if those lawswere binding upon nature, or as if they formed a part of nature, deceiveboth you and themselves. The (so-called) laws of nature have their soleseat, origin, and function in the human mind. They are simply theconditions under which the regularity of nature is recognised. Theyexplain the external world, but they reside in the internal. As yet weknow scarcely anything of the laws of mind, and, therefore, we scarcelyknow anything of the laws of nature. We talk of the law of gravitation,and yet we know not what gravitation is; we talk of the conservation offorce and distribution of forces, and we know not what forces are; wetalk with complacent ignorance of the atomic arrangements of matter, andwe neither know what atoms are nor what matter is; we do not even knowif matter, in the ordinary sense of the word, can be said to exist; wehave as yet only broken the first ground, we have but touched the crustand surface of things. Before us and around us there is an immense anduntrodden field, whose limits the eye vainly strives to define; socompletely are they lost in the dim and shadowy outline of the future.In that field, which we and our posterity have yet to traverse, I firmlybelieve that the imagination will effect quite as much as theunderstanding. Our poetry will have to reinforce our logic, and we mustfeel as much as we argue. Let us then hope, that the imaginative andemotional minds of one sex will continue to accelerate the greatprogress, by acting upon and improving the colder and harder minds ofthe other sex.Buckle (Influence of Women on the Progress ofKnowledge).                    6.... _the vision to retain_,As with Wordsworths nature-nurtured maiden:             ... beauty born of murmuring sound             Shall pass into her face ...             And vital feelings of delight             Shall rear her form to stately height ...                 The floating clouds their state shall lend             To her; for her the willow bend,             Nor shall she fail to see             Even in the motions of the storm             Grace that shall mould the maidens form             By silent sympathy.                           (Poems of the Imagination)._Id._... My hope becomes as broad as the horizon afar, reiterated byevery leaf, sung on every bough, reflected in the gleam of every flower.There is so much for us yet to come, so much to be gathered, andenjoyed. Not for you or me, now, but for our race, who will ultimatelyuse this magical secret for their happiness. Earth holds secrets enoughto give them the life of the fabled Immortals. My heart is fixed firmand stable in the belief that ultimately the sunshine and the summer,the flowers and the azure sky, shall become, as it were, interwoven intomans existence. He shall take from all their beauty and enjoy theirglory.... He is indeed despicable who cannot look onwards to the ideallife of man. Not to do so is to deny our birthright of mind.R.Jefferies (The Pageant of Summer).      7, 8.... _mould their dreams of love, with conscious skill          To human living types_ ...    Her Brain enlabyrinths the whole heaven of her bosom and loins    To put in act what her Heart wills.                        William Blake (Jerusalem).These states belong so purely to the inner nature; are so deeply hiddenbeneath the strata of what we call the inner life, even, that onlywomen, and of these, only such as have become self-acquainted, throughseeing the depths within the depths of their own consciousness, canfully comprehend all that is meant in the words a Purposed Maternity.I use them in their highest sense, meaning not the mere purpose ofsatisfying the maternal instincts, which the quadruped feels and actsfrom, as well as the human being, but the intelligent, artistic purpose(to which the maternal instinct is a fundamental motive), to act inharmony with Nature in producing the most perfect being which the powersand resources employed, can bring forth.... It is probable that weshall, ere long, arrive at truer views of maternity everywhere; and whenwe do, I think it will be seen that the office has a sacredness inNatures eyes above all other offices, and that she reserves for it thefinest of her vital forces, powers, susceptibilities, and means of everysort.Eliza W. Farnham (Woman and Her Era, Vol. II., p. 385; Vol. I.,p. 93).[It has been an intense delight to come upon these and the other wordsand thoughts of Eliza W. Farnham; blazes or axe-marks of this previouspioneer in the same exploration. It is only since completing the wholeof the verses that the writer has found the passages quoted from Mrs.Farnhams work, and deduces a not unnatural confirmation of the mutuallyshared views, from the singular concord and unanimity of theirexpression.]                  8.... _supreme of form and will_.The changes that have come over us in our social life during the pasttwo decades are, in many respects, remarkable, but in no particular arethey so remarkable as in the physical training and education ofwomen....The results of this social change have been on the whole beneficialbeyond expectation. The health of women generally is improving under thechange; there is amongst women generally less bloodlessness, less ofwhat the old fiction-writers called swooning; less of lassitude, less ofnervousness, less of hysteria, and much less of that general debility towhich, for want of a better term, the words _malaise_ and languorhave been applied. Woman, in a word, is stronger than she was in oldentime. With this increase of strength woman has gained in development ofbody and of limb. She has become less distortioned. The curved back, thepigeon-shaped chest, the disproportioned limb, the narrow feeble trunk,the small and often distorted eyeball, the myopic eye, and punyill-shaped external earall these parts are becoming of better and morenatural _contour_. The muscles are also becoming more equally and morefully developed, and with these improvements, there are growing upamongst women models who may, in due time, vie with the best models thatold Greek culture has left for us to study in its undying art.Dr.Richardson (The Young Woman, Oct., 1892).           _Id._... prophetic scenes,           Spiritual projections ...           In one, the sacred parturition scene,           A happy, painless mother births a perfect child.                     Walt Whitman (Autumn Rivulets)._Id._... I am so rapt in the beauty of the human form, and soearnestly, so inexpressibly prayerful to see that form perfect, thatmy full thought is not to be written.... It is absolutelyincontrovertible that the ideal shape of the human being is attainableto the exclusion of deformities.... When the ambition of the multitudeis fixed on the ideal form and beauty, then that ideal will becomeimmediately possible, and a marked advance towards it could be made inthree generations.Richard Jefferies (The Story of My Heart, pp.32, 151, 131)._Id._... The Gods? In yourselves will ye see them, when Venus shall favour    your love, And man, fitly mated with woman, believes that his love is divine: When passion shall elevate woman to something so holy and grand That shethe ideal enrapturedshall neer be a check upon Man, Then the children they bear will be holy, and beauty shall make them her    own, And man in the eyes of his neighbour will gaze on the reflex divine Of the God he inclines to in spiritor trace in each feature and limb The lines which the body inherits from souls which are noble and true. Would thou couldst feel in deep earnest, how beautiful God will be then, When we see Him as Jove or Apollo in men who inspire us with love, As Juno and Venus the holy, in women who know not the mean, And feel not the influence cruel of hardness and self-love and scorn. Would thou couldst once know how real the presence of God will become, How earnest and ever more earnest thy faith when thyself shall be great, And from the true worship of others thoult learn what is holy in them, And rise to the infinite fountain of glory which flows in us all.         C. G. Leland (The Return of the Gods).                                  LXI.                        3._Their science_ ...                                   Science then           Shall be a precious visitant; and then           And only then, be worthy of her name:           For then her heart shall kindle; her dull eye,           Dull and inanimate, no more shall hang           Chained to its object in brute slavery;           But taught with patient industry to watch           The processes of things, and serve the cause           Of order and distinctness, not for this           Shall it forget that its most noble use,           Its most illustrious province, must be found           In furnishing clear guidance, a support           Not treacherous, to the minds _excursive_ power.               Wordsworth (The Excursion, Book IV.).                    4.... _crude dimensions_ ...In these material things, too, I think that we require another circleof ideas, and I believe that such ideas are possible, and, in a mannerof speaking, exist. Let me exhort everyone to do their utmost to thinkoutside and beyond our present circle of ideas. For every idea gained isa hundred years of slavery remitted. Even with the idea of organisation,which promises most, I am not satisfied, but endeavour to get beyond andoutside it, so that the time now necessary may be shortened.RichardJefferies (Story of My Heart, p. 180).   8._The love that lifts the life from rank of earth to heaven._             ... utter knowledge is but utter love             onian Evolution, swift and slow,             Thro all the spheresan ever opening height,             An ever lessening earth.                                   Tennyson (The Ring)._Id._...                                    The light of love            Not failing, perseverance from their steps            Departing not, they shall at length obtain            The glorious habit by which sense is made            Subservient still to moral purposes,            Auxiliar to divine. That change shall clothe            The naked spirit, ceasing to deplore            The burthen of existence....            So build we up the Being that we are;            Thus deeply drinking-in the soul of things,            We shall be wise perforce; and, while inspired            By choice, and conscious that the Will is free,            Unswerving shall we move as if impelled            By strict necessity, along the path            Of order and of good. Whateer we see,            Whateer we feel, by agency direct            Or indirect, shall tend to feed and nurse            Our faculties, shall fix in calmer seats            Of moral strength, and raise to loftier heights            Of love divine, our intellectual soul.                Wordsworth (The Excursion, Book IV.).                                 LXII.        1, 2.... _winged words on which the soul would pierce                Into the height of loves rare Universe_.The two lines are Shelleys, in his Epipsychidion.             7._Mans destiny with womans blended be_.              ... in the long years liker must they grow;              The man be more of woman, she of man.                    Tennyson (The Princess, Part VII.).   _Id._Dans ma manire de sentir, je suis femme aux trois quarts.               Ernest Renan (Souvenirs dEnfance)._Id._...                       Das Ewigweibliche                       Zieht uns hinan.               Goethe (concluding two lines of Faust).                      8.... _progression_, ... Unfolded out of the folds of the woman, man comes unfolded, and is    always to come unfolded; Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth, is to come the    superbest man of the earth; Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man; Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be formd of    perfect body; Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of the woman, can come the    poems of man ... Unfolded out of the folds of the womans brain come all the folds of the    mans brain, duly obedient; Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded; Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy; A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through eternitybut every    jot of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman, First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself.                 Walt Whitman (Leaves of Grass).                                 LXIII.                2.... _the dream men named Divine_,Divine was the title of honour conferred on the Commedia, by therepentant citizens of Florence, after the death of Dante.      8._The love that moves the sun and every circling star_.The last line of the Divina Commedia is             Lo amor che move il sole e le altre stelle.                               EPILOGUE.What, then, is the result of these investigations?Briefly this:That woman is not incapable of equal mental and physical power with man:That where any inferiority on her part at present exists, it is but asthe inherited result of long ages of misuse of her functions, and ofwant of training of her faculties:That an intelligent education in both directions can repair thesewrongs, and establish her due individuality, and her equal share inhuman right and happiness:That the principle which regulates the existing social relationsbetween the two sexesthe legal subordination of one sex to the otheriswrong in itself and now one of the chief hindrances to humanimprovement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfectequality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side, nordisability on the other(JOHN STUART MILL, The Subjection of Women,Ch. I.):And that, as the result of womans amended position, the whole humanrace will benefit physically and psychically.Thus much, at least, may be fairly concluded from the Notes herepresented; in the gathering together of which scattered raysthoughtsand experiences from many an observant mindinto one focus, to offerlight and warmth to suffering womanhood and humanity, the main purposeof this book is accomplished.                                                                 _E.

[By the law of England a girl is still marriageable at twelve and a  boy at fourteen years of age; though the age of consent to  intercourse not thus sanctioned has been recently raised to sixteen  years in the case of girls. In the above matters, and notably in that  of the marriageable age, England remains barbarously below most modern  legislatures, and is indeed in the disgraceful condition of being not  even on a level with China, in which countryas Mr. Byrant Barrett  points out, in his Introductory Discourse to the Code Napolon, p.  66In females, it would appear, consummation is not allowable before  twelve, while the age for marriage in males is twenty complete.  China and England are but slightly in advance of ancient India, where,  according to the precepts of Manu, as Mr. Barrett further shows, (p.  30), The male of 24 years should marry the girl of 8 years of age;  the male of 30 the female of 12 (Ordinances of Manu, ch. 9, sec. 94).  Is not such conduct as this sufficient to involve as inevitable  consequences unripe maternity and untimely birth, together with all  their dire inherited miseries?] Epicenity, 181, 182. Equality of sexes, 43, 45, 49, 57, 79, 133, 134, 153, 154, 156, 162,    163, 194.   _See_ also the following:  But I hear you indignantly reject the boon of equality with such  creatures as men now are. With you I would equally elevate both sexes.  Really enlightened women, disdaining equally the submissive tricks of  the slave and the caprices of the despot, breathing freely only in the  air of the esteem of equals, and of mutual, unbought, uncommanded,  affection, would find it difficult to meet with associates worthy of  them in men as now formed, full of ignorance and vanity, priding  themselves on a _sexual_ superiority, entirely independent of any  merit, any superior qualities, or pretentions to them, claiming  respect from the strength of their arm, and the lordly faculty of  producing beards attached by nature to their chins! No: unworthy of,  as incapable of appreciating, the delight of the society of such  women, are the great majority of the existing race of men. The  pleasures of mere animal appetite, the pleasures of commanding (the  prettier and more helpless the slave, the greater these pleasures of  the brute), are the only pleasures which the majority of men seek from  women, are the only pleasures which their education and the  hypocritical system of morals, with which they have been necessarily  imbued, permit them to expect.... To wish for the enjoyment of the  higher pleasures of sympathy and communication of knowledge between  the sexes, heightened by that mutual grace and glow, that decorum and  mutual respect, to which the feeling of perfect, unrestrained equality  in the intercourse gives birth, a man must have heard of such  pleasures, must be able to conceive them, and must have an  organisation from nature or education, or both, capable of receiving  delight from them when presented to him. To enjoy these pleasures, to  which their other pleasures, a few excepted, are but the play of  children or brutes, the bulk of men want a sixth sense; they want the  capacity of feeling them, and of believing that such things are in  nature to be found. A mole cannot enjoy the beauties and glories of  the visible world; nor can brute men enjoy the intellectual and  sympathetic pleasures of equal intercourse with women, such as some  are, such as all might be. Real and comprehensive knowledge, physical  and moral, equally and impartially given by education, and by all  other means to both sexes, is the key to such higher enjoyments....  Demand with mild but unshrinking firmness, perfect equality with men:  demand equal civil and criminal laws, an equal system of morals, and,  as indispensable to these, equal political laws, to afford you an  equal chance of happiness with men, from the development and exercise  of your faculties.  William Thompson (Appeal of One Half the Human Race, 1825, pp. xii,  195). Ethics, 74, 147, 173, 177, 186.  [The impotent and contradictory schemes of ethics which philosophers  or schoolmen, ancient and modern, have successively evolved, have been  but resultants of unisexual wit. With brilliant exceptions in Plato,  Kant, and Mill, vainly may the various codes be searched for any  suggestion of the identity, individuality, and equality, of woman. For  though the philosophy of latter-day ethicists rightly disdains to  reiterate or to countenance the factitious scriptural dogmas and  imprecations declaratory or explanatory of womans unequal and  subjugated condition, yet a parallel subjection and inferiority in her  nature is still tacitly assumed, and on occasion traded upon, by these  same ethicists; no counsel or consent of her own intelligence being  asked, or disavowal recked of, in such propositions as, _e.g._, the  utilitarian theses concerning her enounced by Archdeacon Paley or  Mr. Jeremy Bentham;the nominally goddess, but virtually slave,  status assigned to her by M. Auguste Comte;or the due amount of  child-bearing postulated as prior to all normally feminine mental  energy in her, by Mr. Herbert Spencer. As the bane of all theologies  has been the implicated degradation and subserviency of womanhood to  the unjustly favoured male sex, so the vital defect in the plans of  ethics is this irrational disregard for the personality and interests  of one half the human race,this ignoring or negation of womans  equal claim with man to consideration, position, and action, in all  that relates to humanity, ethics included. At present the general  masculine sex-bias, or selfishness, refuses to women the wisest and  noblest a faculty in legislation conceded to even the meanest men; and  justice and injustice, pessimism and optimism, struggle together  blindly and helplessly in the dark. The true Ethic still awaits for  its formulation the assistance and the inspiration of the intellect of  woman equal and free: no other way can it be arrived at.] Evolution, 39, 40, 41, 78, 87, 88, 107, 122, 173, 180, 208, 210, 211,    218, 220, 222;   _see_ Development.

For months after the fall of Delhi she contrived to  baffle Sir Hugh Rose and the English. She led squadrons in the field.  She fought with her own hand. She was engaged against us in the battle  for the possession of Gwalior. In the uniform of a cavalry officer she  led charge after charge, and she was killed among those who resisted  to the last. Her body was found upon the field, scarred with wounds  enough in the front to have done credit to any hero. Sir Hugh Rose  paid her the well-deserved tribute which a generous conqueror is  always glad to be able to offer. He said, in his general order, that  The best man upon the side of the enemy was the woman found dead, the  Ranee of Jhansi.Justin McCarthy (History of Our Own Times, chap.  xiii).  And on the 12th December, 1892, the _Manchester Guardian_ reports:  The death is announced of Mrs. Eliza E. Cutler, wife of the  doorkeeper of the United States Senate. In February, 1863, her  husbands regiment was at Fort Donelson and Mrs. Cutler was visiting  him there, stopping at a house just outside the fortification. The  colours of the regiment were also in this house. In the excitement  which followed the first attack on the day of battle, the regiment  went into action without its flag, but just as the fighting became the  hottest, with odds terribly against them, they were cheered by the  appearance of a woman with a sword in one hand, and bearing  triumphantly aloft the regiments colours. This was Mrs. Cutler, who  remained on the battlefield until her husbands regiment was ordered  on board a transport in the Cumberland river. She immediately went to  the upper deck, where, with assistance, she planted the Stars and  Stripes in the face of a galling fire. There she remained, in spite of  all remonstrances, until they passed out of the range of fire. Mind, influence on body, _see_ Fictility, Psychical effort. Modesty, 170, 171, 199. Monkey, 39.
