                              Beam Pirate                          By GEORGE O. SMITH                         Illustrated by Alfred           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from               Astounding Science-Fiction, October 1944.         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]Mark Kingman was in a fine state of nerves. He looked upon life andthe people in it as one views the dark-brown taste of a hangover. Itseemed to him at the present time that the Lord had forsaken him, forthe entire and complete success of the solar beam had been left only toVenus Equilateral by a sheer fluke of nature. Certainly he, nor anyoneelse, could have foreseen the Channing Layer, that effectively blockedany attempt to pierce it with the strange, sub-level energy spectrumover which the driver tube and the power-transmission tube worked,representing the extremes of the so-called spectrum.But Venus Equilateral, for their part, were well set. Ships plied thespaceways using their self-contained power only during atmosphericpassage, and paid Venus Equilateral well for the privilege. The RelayStation itself was powered on the solar beam, and the costly shipmentsof potential power had been stopped. There were other relay stationsthat belonged to the communications company; Luna, Deimos and Phobos,and the six that circled Venus in lieu of a satellite; all were poweredby the solar beam. And the solar observatory on Mercury used but littlepower, so the needs of the observatory became the sole income forTerran Electric's planetary rights of the solar beam, since Mercuryowned no air of its own.Mark Kingman was beginning to feel the brunt of Channing's statementto the effect that legal-minded men were of little importance when itcame to the technical life in space, where men's lives and livelihooddepended more on technical skill than upon the legal pattern set fortheir protection in the complex society of planetary civilization.It seemed that way. For instead of gaining their ends by legalrestrictions on the power-transmission tube investigations, TerranElectric had lost their chance. Venus Equilateral had the legal rightto tinker with the transmission tubes all they wanted to, and inreturn, Terran Electric held all of the planetary rights to VenusEquilateral's solar beam--which in the domain covered by naturalcelestial bodies was about as valuable as the gold-mining rights to thecrater Tycho.And everyone knows that Luna, as a valuable piece of real estate, isuseful only to Venus Equilateral as a place to plant the Lunar RelayStation that handled the Terran Beam and punched downward at theHeaviside Layer. Luna's valuable assets as to mineral rights consistedof a bit of talc--no longer used because of plastic engineering--andpumice--no longer used because of synthetic engineering.And Kingman knew that only if Terra were not abundant in granite wouldthe Lunar granite come in handy as a source of tombstones; and thatmade him writhe because when he thought of tombstones he also thoughtof his position with Terran Electric, which had been endangered becauseof his own legal connivances.He swore vengeance.So, like the man who doggedly makes the same mistake twice in a row,Kingman was going to move Heaven, Hell, and the three planets in aneffort to take a swing at the same jaw that had caught his fist betweenits teeth before.Out through the window of his office, he saw men toiling with the bigtube of the far roof; the self-same tube that had carried the terrificload of Venus Equilateral for ten days without interruption and with noapparent overload. Here on Terra, its output meter, operating througha dummy load, showed not the slightest inclination to leave the bottompeg and seek a home among the higher brackets.The Channing Layer barred the passage of radiation of this so-calledsub-etheric energy as effectively as the Heaviside Layer had blockedInterplanetary Communications for many, many years.So Kingman cursed and hated himself for having backed himself intotrouble. But Kingman was not a complete fool. He was a brilliantattorney, and his record had placed him in the position of AssistantChief Attorney for Terran Electric, which was a place of no meanimportance. He had been licked on the other fellow's ground, with theother fellow's tools.He picked up papers that carried, side by side, the relative assetsof Venus Equilateral and Terran Electric. He studied them and thoughtdeeply.To his scrutiny, the figures, seemed about equal, though perhaps theInterplanetary Communications Co. was a bit ahead.But--he had been licked on the other fellow's ground with the otherfellow's tools; he thought that if he fought on his own ground, withhis own tools, he might be able to swing the deal.And Terran Electric was not without a modicum of experience in thetools of the other fellow. His engineering department was brilliant andefficient, too; at least the equal of Channing and Franks and theirgang of laughing gadgeteers. That not only gave him the edge of havinghis own tools and his own ground, but a bit of the other fellow'sinstruments too. Certainly his engineering department should be able tothink of something good.       *       *       *       *       *William Cartright, business manager for Venus Equilateral, interruptedDon and Walt in a discussion. He carried a page of stock marketquotations and a few hundred feet of ticker tape.Channing put down his pencil and leaned back in his chair. Walt didlikewise, and said: "What's brewing?""Something I do not like.""So?""The stock has been cutting didoes. We've been up and down so much itlooks like a scenic railway.""How do we come out?""Even, mostly; but from my experience, I would say that some bird isplaying hooky with Venus Equilateral, Preferred. The common is evenworse.""Look bad?""Not too good. It is more than possible that some guy with money andthe desire might be able to hook a large slice of V.E. Preferred. Idon't think they could get control, but they could garner a pluralityfrom stock outstanding on the planets. Most of the preferred stuffis in the possession of the folks out here, you know, but aside fromyourself, Walt, and a couple of dozen of the executive personnel, thestock is spread pretty thin. The common stock has a lot of itselfrunning around loose Outside. Look!"Cartright began to run off the many yards of ticker tape. "Here, someguy dumped a boatload at Canalopsis, and some other guy glommed onto a large hunk at New York. The Northern Landing Exchange showed abit of irregularity during the couple of hours of tinkering, and theirregularity was increased because some bright guy took advantage of itand sold short." He reeled off a few yards and then said: "Next, wehave the opposite tale. Stuff was dumped at Northern Landing, and therewas a wild flurry of bulling at Canalopsis. The Terran Exchange wasjust flopping up and down in a general upheaval, with the boys sellingat the top and buying at the bottom. That makes money, you know,and if you can make the market tick your way--I mean control enoughstuff--your purchases at the bottom send the market up a few pointsand then you dump it, and it drops again. It wouldn't take more thana point or two to make a guy rich, if you had enough stock and couldcontinue to make the market vacillate.""That's so," agreed Don. "Look, Bill, why don't we set one of ourTerran agents to tinkering too? Get one of our best men to try tooutguess the market. As long as it is being done systematically, heshould be able to follow the other guy's thinking. That's the best wecan do unless we go gestapo and start listening in on all the stuffthat goes through the Station here.""Would that help?""Yeah, but we'd all land in the hoosegow for breaking the secrecylegislation. You know. 'No one shall ... intercept ... transmit ...eavesdrop upon ... any message not intended for the listener,and ... shall not ... be party to the use of any informationgained ... et cetera.' That's us. The trouble is this lag between theworlds. They can prearrange their bulling and bearing ahead of time andplay smart. With a little luck, they can get the three markets workingjust so--going up at Northern Landing; down at Terra; and up again atCanalopsis, just like waves in a rope. By playing fast and loose onpaper, they can really run things hell, west, and crooked. Illegal,probably, since they each will no doubt claim to have all the stock intheir possession, and yet will be able to sell and buy the same stockat the same time in three places.""Sounds slightly precarious to me," objected Cartright."Not at all, if you figure things just right. At a given instant, Petemay be buying at sixty-five on Venus; Joe may be selling like furiousat seventy-one on Mars; and Jimmy may be bucking him up again by buyingat sixty-five on Terra. Then the picture and the tickers catch up withone another, and Joe will start buying again at sixty-five, whilst Peteand Jimmy are selling at seventy-one. Once they get their periodicityrunning, they're able to tinker the market for quite a time. That'swhere your man comes in, Bill. Have him study the market and step in atthe right time and grab us all a few cheap ones. Get me?""Sure," said Cartright. "I get it. In that way, we'll tend to stabilizethe market, as well as getting the other guy's shares.""Right. I'll leave it up to you. Handle this thing for the bestinterests of all of us."       *       *       *       *       *Cartright smiled once again, and left with a thoughtful expression onhis face. Channing picked up the miniature of the power-transmissiontube and studied it as though the interruption had not occurred. "We'llhave to use about four of these per stage," he said. "We'll have to usean input-terminal tube to accept the stuff from the previous stage,drop it across the low-resistance load, resistance couple the stageto another output terminal tube where we can make use of the couplingcircuits without feedback. From there into the next tube, with the highresistance load, and out of the power-putter-outer tube across the deskto the next four-bottle stage.""That's getting complicated," said Walt. "Four tubes per stage ofamplification.""Sure. As the arts and sciences get more advanced, things tend to getmore complicated.""That's essentially correct," agreed Walt with a smile. "But you'reforeguessing. We haven't even got a detector that will detect driverradiation.""I know, and perhaps this thing will not work. But after all, we'vegot the tubes and we might as well think them out just in case. We'lldetect driver radiation soon enough, and then we might as well have afew odd thoughts on how to amplify it for public use. Nothing wouldtickle me more than to increase those three circles on our letterheadto four. 'Planet to Planet, and Ship to Ship' is our hope. This one-waybusiness is not to my liking. How much easier it would have been if I'dbeen able to squirt a call in to the Station when I was floating outthere beyond Jove in that wrecked ship. That gave me to think, Walt.Driver-radiation detection is the answer.""How so?""We'll use the detector to direct our radio beam, and the ship can havea similar gadget coupled to their beam, detecting a pair of drivers setat one hundred and eighty degrees from one another so the thrust won'tupset the Station's celestial alignment. We can point one of them atthe ship's course, even, making it easier for them.""Speaking of direction," said Walt thoughtfully, "have you figured outwhy the solar beam is always pointing behind Sol?""I haven't given that much thought. I've always thought that it wasdue to the alignment plates not being in linear perfection so that thepower beam bends. They can make the thing turn a perfect right angle,you know.""Well, I've been toying with the resurrected heap you dropped into LakeMichigan a couple of months ago, and I've got a good one for you. Youknow how the beam seems to lock into place when we've got it turned toSol, not enough to make it certain, but more than detectably directive?""Yep. We could toss out the motor control that keeps her face turned tothe sun.""That's what I was hoping to gain--" started Walt, but he stopped asthe door opened and Arden entered, followed by a man and woman."Hello," said Walt in a tone of admiration."This is Jim Baler and his sister Christine," said Arden. "Baler,the guy with the worried look on his face is my legally weddedspouse--souse--no, spouse. And the guy with the boudoir gorilla gleamin his vulpine eye is that old vulture, Walt Franks."Walt took the introduction in his stride and offered Christine hischair. Arden stuck her tongue out at him, but Walt shrugged it off,ignoring her. Channing shook hands with Jim Baler and then sought the'S' drawer of his file cabinet. He found the Scotch and the soda,and then grinned: "Should have the ice under 'I,' but it's sort ofperishable, and so we keep it in the refrigerator. Arden, breach the'G' drawer and haul out the glasses, will you please? I suppose wecould refrigerate the whole cabinet, but it wouldn't sound right ifpeople heard that we kept their mail on ice. Well--""Here's how, if we don't already know," said Walt, clinking glasseswith Christine."Walt earned that 'wolf' title honestly," laughed Arden, "he likes tothink. Frankly, he's a sheep in wolf's clothing!""What are his other attributes?" asked Christine."He invents. He scribbles a bit. He cuts doodles on tablecloths, and hemanages to get in the way all the time," said Don. "We keep him aroundthe place for his entertainment value.""Why--""Quiet, Walter, or I shall explain the sordid details of the WalterFranks Electron Gun.""What was that one?" asked Christine."You really wouldn't want to know," Walt told her."Oh, but I would.""Yeah," growled Franks, "you would.""Would you rather hear it from him, or me?" Arden asked."He'll tell me," said Christine. Her tone was positive and assured."And that'll take care of that," said Arden. "But I think weinterrupted something. What were you saying about gaining, Walt?"       *       *       *       *       *"Oh, I was saying that I was tinkering around the skyways with the_Anopheles_--that's the ship we hooked up with the solar beam forpower, you know--and I got to wondering about that discrepancy. Thefaster you go, the greater is the angular displacement, and then withsome measurements, I came up with a bugger factor--""Woah, goodness," laughed Christine. "What is a bugger factor?""You'll learn," said Arden, "that the boys out here have a language alltheir own. I've heard them use that one before. The bugger factor is asort of multiplying, or dividing, or additive, or subtractive quantity.You perform the mathematical operation with the bugger factor, and youroriginal wrong answer turns into the right answer.""Is it accepted?""Oh sure," answered Arden. "People don't realize it, but that stringof 4's in the derivation of Bode's Law is a bugger factor.""You," said Christine to Walt, "will also tell me what Bode's Lawis--but later.""O.K.," grinned Walt. "At any rate, I came up with a bugger factor thatgave me to think. The darned solar beam points to where Sol actuallyis!""_Whoosh!_" exclaimed Channing. "You don't suppose we're tinkering withthe medium that propagates the law of gravity?""I don't know. I wouldn't know. Has anyone ever tried to measure thevelocity of propagation of the attraction of gravity?""No, and no one will until we find some way of modulating it."Jim Baler smiled. "No wonder Barney was a little wacky when he gothome. I come out here to take a look around and maybe give a lift toyour gang on the transmission tube--and bump right into a discussion onthe possibility of modulating the law of gravity!""Not the law, Jim, just the force.""Now he gets technical about it. You started out a couple of months agoto detect driver radiation, and ended up by inventing a beam that drawspower out of the sun. Think you'll ever find the driver radiation?""Probably.""Yeah," drawled Arden. "And I'll bet a hat that when they do, theywon't have any use for it. I've seen 'em work before.""Incidentally," asked Christine, "you mentioned the _Anopheles_, and Ithink that is the first ship I've ever heard of that hasn't a femininename. How come?""The mosquito that does the damage is the female," grinned Jim. "TheMojave spaceyards owns a sort of tender craft. It has a couple of bigcranes on the top and a whole assortment of girders near the bottom. Itlooks like, and is also called: _The Praying Mantis_. Those are alsofemale; at least the ones that aren't afraid of their shadow are."Channing said suddenly: "Walt, have you tried the propagation-time ofthe solar beam on the _Anopheles_?""No. How would we go about doing that?""By leaving the controls set for 1-G, and then starting the ship byswapping the tube energizing voltages from test power to operatingpower.""Should that tell us?""Sure. As we know, the amount of energy radiated from the sun upon aspot the size of our solar tube is a matter of peanuts compared to thestuff we get out of it. Ergo, our beam must go to Sol and collect thepower and draw it back down the beam. Measure the transit-time, andwe'll know.""That's an idea. I've got a micro-clock in the lab. We can measure itto a thousandth of a second. Anyone like to get shook up?""How?" asked Jim."Snapping from zero to 1-G all to oncet-like isn't too gentle. She'llknock your eyes out.""Sounds like fun. I'm elected.""So am I," insisted Christine."That's out," said Jim. "I know what he's talking about.""So do I," said Arden. "Don't do it.""Well, what better have you to offer?""You and I are going down to the Mall."Channing groaned in mock anguish. "Here goes another closet full offemale haberdashery. I'm going to close that corridor some day, or puta ceiling on the quantity of sales, or make it illegal to sell a womananything unless she can prove that 'she has nothing to wear!'""That, I'd like to see," said Walt."You would," snorted Arden. "Come on, Chris. Better than the best ofthree worlds is available.""That sort of leaves me all alone," said Don. "I'm going to look up WesFarrell and see if he's been able to make anything worth looking at fora driver detector."       *       *       *       *       *Don found Wes in the laboratory, pouring over a complicated circuit.Farrell was muttering under his breath, and probing deep into the mazeof haywire on the bench."Wes, when you get to talking to yourself, it's time to take a jaunt toJoe's.""Not right now," objected Wes. "I haven't got that hollow leg that yourgang seem to have developed. Besides, I'm on the trail of something.""Yes?" Channing forgot about Joe's, and was all interest."I got a wiggle out of the meter there a few minutes ago. I'm trying toget another one.""What was it like?""Wavered up and down like fierce for about a minute after I turned iton. Then it died quick, and has been dead ever since.""Could it have been anything cockeyed with the instruments?""Nope. I've checked every part in this circuit, and everything is asgood as it ever will be. No, something external caused that response.""You've tried the solar tube with a dynode of the same alloy as thedriver cathodes?""Uh-huh. Nothing at all. Oh, I'll take that back. I got a scratch.With a pre-meter gain of about four hundred decibels, I read threemicromicroamperes. That was detected from a driver tube forty feetacross the room, running at full output. I wondered for a minutewhether the opposing driver was doing any cancellation, and so I took achance and killed it for about a half second, but that wasn't it.""Nuts. Does the stuff attenuate with distance?""As best as I could measure, it was something to the tune of inverselyproportional to the cube root of the distance. That's normal for beamsof a not-too-tight nature and it shows that the stuff isn't globularlyradiated. But the amplifier gain was hanging right on the limit ofpossible amplification, and the meter was as sensitive as a meter canbe made, I think. You couldn't talk from one end of Venus Equilateralto the other with a set like that.""No, I guess you're right. Hey! Look!"The meter took a sudden upswing, danced for a minute, and died oncemore."What have you got in there? What did you change?""Oh, I got foolish and tried a tuned circuit across the output of oneof the miniature transmission tubes. It's far enough away from the bigbeams and stuff at the North end so that none of the leakage can causetrouble. Besides, I'm not getting anything like our beam transmissions."Channing laughed. "Uh-huh, looks to me like you're not getting much ofanything at all."Farrell smiled wryly. "Yeah, that's so," he agreed. "But look, Don,Hertz himself didn't collect a transcontinental short-wave broadcast onhis first attempt.""If Hertz had been forced to rely upon vacuum tubes, his theoriescouldn't have been formulated, I think," said Channing. "At least, notby him. The easier frequencies and wave lengths are too long; a fivehundred meter dipole can't be set up in a small room for laboratorytinkering. The kind of frequencies that come of dipoles a couple offeet long, such as Hertz used, are pretty hard to work with unless youhave special tubes.""Hertz had rotten detectors, too. But he made his experiments withspark-gap generators, which gave sufficient high-peak transients toinduce spark-magnitude voltages in his receiving dipole.""I'm not too certain of that tuned-circuit idea of yours, Wes. Go aheadand tinker to your heart's content, but remember that I'm skeptical ofthe standard resonance idea.""Why?""Because we've been tinkering with driver tubes for years andyears--and we have also been gadgeting up detectors, radio hootnannies,and stuff of the electronic spectrum all the way from direct currentto hard X rays, and we have yet to have anything react to driverradiation. Ergo, I'm skeptical."The call bell rang for Channing, and he answered. It was Walt Franks."Don," he said with a laugh in his voice, though it was apparent thathe felt slightly guilty about laughing, "got a 'gram from Addison, theproject engineer on the solar beam from Terran Electric. Says: 'Finallygot through Channing Layer. Power by the megawatt-hour in great shape.But the atmosphere from the Channing Layer right down to the snout ofthe tube is a dull red scintillation. Something like the driver-tubetrail--but it ionizes the atmosphere into ozone. Power by the megawatt,and ozone by the megaton.""Ozone, hey? Lots of it?""Plenty, according to the rest of this. It looks to me like a sort of'denatured' power system. There it is, all nice and potent, cheap, andunlicensed. But the second swallow going down meets the first oneon the way back. Power they got--but the ozone they can't take; it'spoisonous like a nice dose of chlorine. Poor Terran Electric!"       *       *       *       *       *Mark Kingman sat in the control room of a ship of space, and worried.Below the dome, Venus covered three quarters of the sky, and it circledslowly as the Terran Electric ship oscillated gently up and down.Before Kingman, on the desk, were pages of stock market reports. On ablackboard, a jagged line denoted the vacillation of InterplanetaryCommunications, Preferred. This phase of his plan was working toperfection. Gradually, he was burning share after share out ofuninterested hands, by his depredations. Soon he would have enoughstock in Interplanetary to stage a grand show, and then he could swingthe thing his way.His worry was not with this affair.He gloated over that. His belief that he could beat the VenusEquilateral crowd if he fought them on his ground with his weapon wasbeing corroborated. That, plus the fact that he was using some of VenusEquilateral's own thunder to do the job, was giving him to think thatit was but a matter of time.And, he laughed, the poor fools were not aware of their peril. Oh, somebird was trying to buck him, but he was not prepared as Kingman was,nor had he the source of information that Kingman had.No, the thing that worried him was--And there it came again! A wild, cacophonous wailing, like a wholeorchestra of instruments playing at random, in random keys. It shookthe very roots of the body, that terrible caterwauling, and not onlydid it shake the body, and the mind, but it actually caused looseplates to rattle in the bulkhead, and the cabinet doors followed inunison. The diapason stop was out for noon, and the racket filled thesmall control room and bounced back and forth, dinning at the ears ofKingman as it went echoing by. It penetrated to the upper reaches ofthe ship, and the crew gritted their teeth and cursed the necessity ofbeing able to hear orders, for cotton plugs would have been a godsendand a curse simultaneously. Anything that would blot that racket outwould also deafen them to the vital orders necessary to the operationof the ship in this precarious poising maneuver.Two hundred sheer watts of undistorted audio power boomed forth in thattiny room--two hundred watts of pure, undistorted power to racket forthsomething that probably started out as sheer distortion.And yet--Faintly striving against that fearful racket there came a piping,flat-sounding human voice that said: "Kingman! I.C. Preferred just hiteighty-nine!"Kingman scowled and punched on the intership teletype machine. Usingthe communicator set with that racket would have been impossible.The radio man read the note that appeared on his 'type, and smiledgrimly. He saw to his helio-mirror and sighted through a fine telescopeat a spot on Venus, three thousand miles below. The helio began to sendits flashing signal to this isolated spot near the Boiling River, andit was read, acknowledged, and repeated for safety's sake. The radioman flashed "O.K." and went back to his forty-seventh game of chesswith the assistant pilot.The helio man on the Boiling River read the message, grinned, andstepped to the telephone. He called a number at Northern Landing,and a tight beam sped across the Northern quarter of Venus to a manconnected with the Venus Stock Market. The man nodded, and said toanother: "Buy fifteen hundred--use the name of Ralph Gantry this time."The stock purchased under the name of Ralph Gantry was signed, sealed,and delivered exactly fourteen minutes before the ticker projection onthe grand wall of the Exchange showed the I.C. Preferred stock turn thebottom curve and start upward by hitting Eighty-nine!       *       *       *       *       *Back in the Terran Electric spaceship, Kingman's ears were still besetby the roaring, alien music.He was sitting in his chair with his head between his hands, anddid not see the man approaching the instrument panel with a pairof side-cutters in one hand. The man reached the panel, liftedit slightly, and reached forward. Then Kingman, hearing a slightimperfection in the wail of the speaker, looked up, jumped from hischair, and tackled the engineer."You blasted fool!" blazed Kingman. "You idiot!"The music stopped at his third word, and the scream of his voice in thesilence of the room almost scared Kingman himself."Mark, I'm going nuts. I can't stand that racket.""You're going to stand it. Unless you can get something to cut it out.""I can't. I'm not brilliant enough to devise a circuit that will cutthat noise and still permit the entry of your fellow on Luna.""Then you'll live with it.""Mark, why can't we take that relay apart and work on it?""Ben, as far as I know, that relay is what Channing and his gang wouldgive their whole Station for--and will, soon enough. I don't care howit works--or why.""That's no way to make progress," objected Ben."Yeah, but we've got the only detector for driver radiation in thispart of the universe! I'm not going to have it wrecked by a screwballengineer who doesn't give a care what's going on as long as he cantinker with something new and different. What do we know about it?Nothing. Therefore how can you learn anything about it? What would youlook for? What would you expect to find?""But where is that music coming from?""I don't know. As best as we can calculate, driver radiation propagatesat the square of the speed of light, and that gives us a twenty-fourminute edge on Venus Equilateral at the present time. For all I know,that music may be coming from the other end of the galaxy. At thesquare of the speed of light, you could talk to Centauri and get ananswer in not too long.""But if we had a chance to tinker with that relay, we might be able tofind out what tunes it and then we can tune in the Lunar station andtune out that cat-melody.""I'm running this show--and this relay is going to stay right whereit is. I don't care a hoot about the control circuit it breaks; thosecontacts are set, somehow, so that we can detect driver radiation, andI'm not taking any chances of having it ruined.""Can't you turn the gain down, at least?""Nope. We'd miss the gang at Luna."The speaker spoke in that faint, flat-toned human voice again. It waseasy to see that all that gain was necessary to back up the obviouslyfaint response of Kingman's detector. The speaker said: "Kingman!Addison got power through the Channing Layer!"That was all for about an hour. Meanwhile, the mewling tones burstforth again and again, assaulting the ears with intent to do damage.The messages were terse and for the most part, interesting. They gavethe market reports; they intercepted the beam transmissions through theTerran Heaviside Layer before they got through the Lunar Relay Station,inspected the swiftly-moving tape and transmitted the juicy morsels toKingman via the big driver tube that stood poised outside of the landedspaceship.Kingman enjoyed an hour of celebration at Addison's success, and thenthe joy turned to bitter hate as the message came through telling ofthe ozone that resulted in the passage of the solar beam through theatmosphere. The success of the beam, and the utter impossibility ofusing it were far worse than the original fact of the beam's failure topass the Channing Layer.So Kingman went back to his stock market machinations, and appliedhimself diligently. And as the days wore on, Kingman's groupmanipulated their watered stock and ran the price up and down at will,and after each cycle Kingman's outfit owned just one bit more of VenusEquilateral.Terran Electric would emerge from this battle with InterplanetaryCommunications as a subsidiary--with Kingman at the helm!       *       *       *       *       *Walt Franks entered Channing's office with a wild-eyed look on hisface. "Don! C^2!""Huh? What are you driving about?""C^2. The speed of light, squared!""Fast--but what is it?""The solar beam! It propagates at C^2!""Oh, now look. Nothing can travel that fast!""Maybe this isn't _something_!""It has energy, energy has mass, mass cannot travel faster than thelimiting speed of light.""O.K. It can't do it. But unless my measurements are all haywire, thebeam gets to Sol and back at C^2. I can prove it.""Yeah? How? You couldn't possibly measure an interval so small as twotimes sixty-seven million miles--the radius of Venus' orbit--traversedat the speed of light squared.""No. I admit that. But, Don, I got power out of Sirius!""You WHAT?" yelled Channing."Got power out of Sirius. And unless I can't use a micro-clock, itfigured out from here to Sirius and back with the bacon in just aboutninety-three percent of the speed of light, squared. Seven percent iswell within the experimental error, I think, since we think of Siriusas being eight-and-one-half light-years away. That's probably not tooaccurate as a matter of fact, but it's the figure I used. But here weare. Power from Sirius at C^2. Thirty-five billion miles per second!This stuff doesn't care how many laws it breaks!""Hm-m-m. C^2, hey? Oh, lovely. Look, Walt, let's run up and takea whirl at Wes Farrell's detector. I'm beginning to envisionperson-to-person service, ship-to-ship service, and possibly the firstInter-planet Network. Imagine hearing a play-by-play description of theInterplanetary Series!""Wool-gathering," snorted Walt. "We've gotta catch our detector first!""Wes has something. First glimmer we've had. I think this is the timeto rush into it with all feet and start pushing!""O.K. Who do we want?""Same gang as usual. Charley and Freddy Thomas, Walton, Jim Warren, WesFarrell, of course, and you can get Jim Baler into it too. No, Walt,Christine Baler is not the kind of people you haul into a screwdrivermeeting.""I was merely thinking.""I know. But you're needed, and if she were around, you'd be a totalloss as far as cerebration.""I like her.""So does Barney Carroll.""Um. Hadn't thought of that one. O.K., no Christine in our conference.I'll have Jeanne call the screwballs on the communicator."They dribbled into Farrell's laboratory one by one, and then Don said:"We have a detector. It is about as efficient as a slab of marble; onlymore so. We can get a tinkle of about ten micromicroamps at twenty feetdistance from a driver tube using eight KVA input, which if we ratethis in the usual spaceship efficiency, comes to about one-half G.That's about standard, for driver tubes, since they run four to a shipat 2-G total."Now, that is peanuts. We should be able to wind a megameter aroundthe peg at twenty feet. Why the red ionization comes out of the tubeand hits our so-called detector, and the amount of ozone it creates isterrific. Yet we can't get a good reading out of it."Walt asked: "Wes, what worked, finally?""A four-turn coil on a ceramic form, in series with a twentymicromicrofarad tuning condenser. I've been using a circular plate as acollector.""Does it tune?""Nope. Funny thing, though, it won't work without a condenser in thecircuit. I can use anything at all there without tuning it. But, darnit, the coil is the only one that works.""That's slightly ridiculous. Have you reconstructed all factors?""Inductance, distributed capacity, and factor 'Q' are all right on thebutton with two more I made. Nothing dioding.""Hm-m-m. This takes the cake. Nothing works, you say?""Nothing in my mind. I've tried about three hundred similar coils, andnot a wiggle since. That's the only one."Charley Thomas said: "Wes, have you tried your tube-amplifier systemahead of it?""Yes, and nothing at all happens then. I don't understand that one,because we know that any kind of input power will be re-beamed assimilar power. I should think that the thing would amplify the samekind of stuff. I've used a solar beam miniature with a driver-alloydynode in it, but that doesn't work either.""Shucks," said Charley.       *       *       *       *       *Don stood up and picked up the coil. "Fellows, I'm going to make agrand, old college try!""Yes?" asked Walt."I've got a grand idea, here. One, I'm still remembering that businessof making the receptor dynode of the same alloy as the transmittercathode. I've a hunch that this thing is not so much an inductor, butsomething sour in the way of alloy-selectivity. If I'm right, I may cutthis in half, and make two detectors, each of similar characteristics.Shall I?""Go ahead. We've established the fact that it is not thephysico-electrical characteristics of that coil," said Wes. "I, too,took my chances and rewound that same wire on a couple of other forms.So it doesn't count as far as an inductance goes. So we can't ruinanything but the total make-up of the wire. I think we may be able tore-establish the wire by self-welding if your idea doesn't work. Now,unless we want to search the three planets for another hunk of wire towork like this one did, without knowing what to look for and thereforetrying every foot of wire on three planets--""I'll cut it," said Channing with a smile. His cutters snipped, andthen fastened one end of the wire to the coil, stripping the otherportion off and handing it to Charley Thomas, who rewound it on anotherform."Now," said Don, "crank up your outfit and we'll try this hunk."The beam tubes were fired up, and the smell of ozone began to makeitself prominent. Channing cranked up the air-vent capacity to removethe ozone more swiftly. The men applied themselves to the detectorcircuits, and Wes, who recognized the results, said: "This hunk works.About as good as the whole coil."Channing replaced the first coil with the second. Wes inspected theresults and said: "Not quite as good, but it does work."Walt nodded, and said: "Maybe it should be incandescent.""That's a thought. Our solar beam uses an incandescent dynode."Channing removed the second coil and handed it to Freddy. "Take thisthing down to the metallurgical lab and tell 'em to analyze it rightdown to the trace of sodium that seems to be in everything. I wantquantitative figures on every element in it. Also, cut off a hunk andsee if the crystallographic expert can detect anything peculiar, thatwould make this hunk of copper wire different from any other hunk.Follow?""Yup," said Freddy. "We'll also start making similar alloys with a fewpercent variation on the composition metals. Right?""That's the ticket. Wes, can we evacuate a tube with this wire in itand make it incandescent?""Let's evacuate the room. I like that stunt.""You're the engineer on this trick. Do it your way.""Thanks. I get the program, all right. Why not have Charley build us amodulator for the driver tube? Then when we get this thing perfected,we'll have some way to test it.""Can do, Charley?""I think so. It's easy. We'll just modulate the cathode current of theelectron guns that bombard the big cathode. That is the way we adjustfor drive; it should work as a means of amplitude-modulation.""O.K.," said Channing. "We're on the rails for this one. We'll gettogether as soon as our various laboratories have their answers andhave something further to work with."       *       *       *       *       *Above Venus, Mark Kingman was listening to the wailing roar of aliensymphony and cursing because he could hardly hear the voice of hisLunar accomplice saying: "V. E. Preferred just hit one hundred and two!"Fifteen minutes before the peak hit Northern Landing, share aftershare was being dumped, and in addition, a message was on its wayback to Terra. It went on the regular beam transmission through VenusEquilateral, carefully coded. It said:"Have sufficient stock and additional collateral to ply the firstpressure. Apply phase two of plan. Kingman."In the ten hours that followed, Venus Equilateral stock went down anddown and down, passed through a deep valley, and started up again.Up it went. Up past the one hundred mark, up into the one hundredand fifties. It hovered there for a bit, and then started up again.Kingman's crowd was offering twice the market for the preferred stock,and there was little to have. It took a short-time dip at threehundred, and the few minutes of decline smoked a lot of stock out ofthe hands of people who looked upon this chance as the right time tomake their money and get out.Then the stock began to climb again, and those people who thought thatthe price had been at its peak-and-passed were angrily trying to buy inagain. That accelerated the climb, but Kingman's crowd, operating onVenus and on Mars and on Terra were buying only, and selling not oneshare of Interplanetary Communications.Terran Electric stock took a gradual slide, for Kingman's crowdneeded additional money. But the slide was slow, and controlled, andmanipulated only for the purpose of selling short. Terran Electricstock eventually remained in the hands of Kingman's crowd, though itsvalue was lessened.I. C. Preferred hit four hundred and sixty-eight, and hovered. Itvacillated around that point for another hour, and the market closed atfour hundred and sixty-nine and three-eighths.Kingman looked at his watch and smiled. He reached forth and cut thedinning sound of the cacophony with a vicious twist of the gain knob.Silence reigned in the spaceship; grand, peaceful silence. Kingman,his nerves frayed by the mental activity and the brain-addlingmusic-from-nowhere, took a hot shower and went to bed.He locked the panel of the control room first, however. He wanted noengineer tinkering with his pet relay.       *       *       *       *       *Cartright came into Channing's living room with a long face. "It'sbad," he said. "Bad.""What's bad?""Oh I, like the rest of the fools, got caught in his trap.""Whose trap?""The wild man who is trying to rock Interplanetary Communications onits axis.""Well, how?""They started to buy like mad, and I held out. Then the thing droppeda few points, and I tried to take a bit of profit, so that we couldgo on bolstering the market. They grabbed off my stock, and then, justlike _that!_ the market was on the way up again and I couldn't findmore than a few odd shares to buy back.""Don't worry," said Channing, "I don't think anybody is big enough toreally damage us. Someone is playing fast and loose, making a killing.When this is over, we'll still be in business.""I know, Don, but whose business will it be? Ours, or theirs?""Is it that bad?""I'm afraid so. One more flurry like today, and they'll be able to towVenus Equilateral out and make Mars Equilateral out of it, and we won'tbe able to say a word.""Hm-m-m. You aren't beaten?""Not until the last drop. I'm not bragging when I say that I'm as goodan operator as the next. My trouble today was not being a mind reader.I'd been doing all right, so far. I've been letting them ride it up anddown with little opposition, and taking off a few here and there as Irode along. Guessing their purpose, I could count on their next move.But this banging the market sky-high has me stumped, or had me stumpedfor just long enough for me to throw our shirt into the ring. They tookthat quick--our shirt, I mean.""That's too bad. What are you leading up to?""There are a lot of unstable stocks that a guy could really play hobwith; therefore their only reason for picking on I. C. is to gaincontrol!""Pirates?""Something like that.""Well," said Channing in a resigned voice, "about all we can do is todo our best and hope we are smart enough to outguess 'em. That's yourjob, Cartright. A long time ago I. C. made their decision concerningthe executive branch of this company, and they elected to run the jointwith technical men. The business aspects and all are under the controlof men who know what they're fighting. We hire business men, just likebusiness men hire engineers, and for the opposite purpose. You're thebest we could get, you know that. If those guys get Venus Equilateral,they'll get you too. But if you do your best and fail, we can't shootyou in the back for it. We'll all go down together. So keep pitching,and remember that we're behind you all the way!""Can we float a bit of a loan?""Sure, if it's needed. I'd prefer Interplanetary Transport if they'lldo business with us. We've been in the way of helping them out a coupleof million dollar losses; they might be anxious to reciprocate.""O.K., I have your power of attorney anyway. If I get in a real crack,I'll scream for I. T. to help. Right?""Right."       *       *       *       *       *Cartright left, and as he closed the door, Channing's face took on adeep, long look. He was worried. He put his head between his hands andthought himself into a tight circle from which he could not escape. Hedid not hear Walt Franks enter behind Arden and Christine."Hey!" said Walt. "Why the gloom? I bear glad tidings!"Channing looked up. "Spill," he said with a glum smile. "I could usesome glad tidings right now.""The lab just reported that that hunk of copper wire was impure. Gota couple of traces of other metals in it. They've been concoctingother samples with more and less of the impurities, and Wes has beentrying them as they were ready. We've got the detector working to thepoint where Freddy has taken the _Relay Girl_ out for a run around theStation at about five hundred miles and Wes is still getting responses!""Is he? How can he know?""Charley rigged the _Relay Girl's_ drivers up with a voice modulator,and Freddy is jerking his head off because the acceleration is directlyproportional to the amplitude of his voice, saying: 'One, two, three,four, test.' Don, have you ever wondered why an engineer can't countabove four?""Walt, does it take a lot of soup to modulate a driver?" asked Arden."Peanuts," grinned Franks. "This stuff is not like the good oldradio; the power for driving the spaceship is derived mostly from thetotal disintegration of the cathode and the voltage applied to thevarious electrodes is merely for the purpose of setting up the properfield-conditions. They draw quite a bit of current, but nothing likethat which would be required to lift a spaceship at 2-G for a hundredhours flat."He turned back to Channing and said: "What's the gloom?"Don smiled in a thoughtful fashion. "It doesn't look so bad right now.Some gang of stock market cutthroats have been playing football withInterplanetary Communications, and Cartright says he is sure that theywant control. It's bad; he's been clipped a couple of hard licks, butwe're still pitching. The thing I'm wondering right now is this: Shallwe toss this possibility of person-to-person and ship-to-ship just atthe right turn of the market to bollix up their machinations, or shallwe keep it to ourselves and start up another company with this as ourbasis?""Can we screw 'em up by announcing it?""Sure. If we drop this idea just at the time they're trying to run thestock down, it'll cross over and take a run up, which will set 'em ontheir ear.""I don't know. Better keep it to ourselves for a bit. Something mayturn up. But come on down to Wes' lab and give a look at our newset-up."Channing stood up and stretched. "I'm on the way," he said.       *       *       *       *       *Farrell was working furiously on the detector device, and as theyentered, he indicated the meter that was jumping up and down. Out of aspeaker there was coming the full, rich tones of Freddy Thomas' voice,announcing solemnly: "One, two, three, four, test."Wes said: "I'm getting better. Charley has been bettering his modulatornow, and the detector is three notches closer to whatever this level ofenergy uses for resonance. Evacuation and the subsequent incandescencewas the answer. Another thing I've found is this--" Farrell held upa flat disk about six inches in diameter with a sawcut from edge tocenter. "As you see, the color of this disk changes from this edge ofthe cut, varying all the way around the disk to the other side of thecut. The darned disk is a varying alloy--I've discovered how to tunethe driver radiation through a limited range. We hit resonance of the_Relay Girl's_ driver system just off the end of this disk. But watchwhile I turn the one in the set."Farrell took a large knob and turned it. Freddy's voice faded, andbecame toneless. Farrell returned the knob to its original position andthe reception cleared again. "Inside of that tube there," said Farrell,"I have a selsyn turning the disk, and a small induction loop thatheats the whole disk to incandescence. A brush makes contact with theedge of the disk and the axle makes the center connection. Apparentlythis stuff passes on a direct line right through the metal, for itworks.""Have you tried any kind of tube amplification?" asked Don."Not yet. Shall we?""Why not? I can still think that the relay tube will amplify if wehook up the input and output loads correctly.""I've got a tube already hooked up," said Walt. "It's mounted in apanel with the proper voltage supplies and so on. If your resistancecalculation is correct, we should get about three thousand voltage gainout of it."He left, and returned in a few minutes with the tube. They busiedthemselves with the connections, and then Don applied the power.Nothing happened."Run a line from the output back through a voltage-dividing circuit tothe in-phase anode," suggested Walt."How much?""Put a potentiometer in it so we can vary the amount of voltage. Afterall, Barney Carroll said that the application of voltage in phase withthe transmitted power is necessary to the operation of the relay tube.In transmission of D. C., it is necessary to jack up the in-phase anodewith a bit of D. C. That's in-phase with a vengeance!""What you're thinking is that whatever this sub-level energy is, someof it should be applied to the in-phase anode?""Nothing but."The cabinet provided a standard potentiometer, and as Don advancedthe amount of fed-back voltage, Freddy's voice came booming in louderand louder. It overloaded the audio amplifier, and they turned thegain down as Channing increased the in-phase voltage more and more. Itpassed through a peak, and then Don left the potentiometer for maximum."Wes," he said, "call Freddy and tell him to take off for Terra, atabout 4-G. Have the gang upstairs hang a ship beam on him so we canfollow him with suggestions. Too bad we can't get there immediately.""What I'm worrying about is the available gain," said Wes. "That thingmay have given us a gain of a couple of thousand, but that isn't goingto be enough. Not for planet-to-planet service.""Later on we may be able to hang a couple of those things in cascade,"suggested Walt."Or if not, I know a trick that will work--one that will enable us toget a gain of several million.""Yeah? Mirrors, or adding machines? You can't make an audio amplifierof a three million gain.""I know it--at least not a practical one. But, we can probably useour audio modulator to modulate a radio frequency, and then modulatethe driver with the RF. Then we hang a receiver on to the detectorgadget here, and collect RF, modulated, just like a standard radiotransmission, and amplify it at RF, convert it to IF, and detect it toAF. Catch?""Sure. And that gives me another thought. It might just be possible,if your idea is possible, that we can insert several frequencies of RFinto the tube and hang a number of receivers on the detector, here."Arden laughed. "From crystal detection to multiplex transmission inten easy lessons."       *       *       *       *       *"Call Charley and have him begin to concoct an RF stage fortube-modulation," said Don. "It'll have to be fairly low--not higherthan a couple of megacycles so that he can handle it with the stuffhe has available, but as long as we can hear his dulcet voicechirping that 'one, two, three, four, test,' of his, we can also haveship-to-Station two-way. We squirt out on the ship beam, and he talksback on the driver transmitter.""That'll be a help," observed Wes. "I'd been thinking by habit that wehad no way to get word back from the _Relay Girl_.""So had I," confessed Walt. "But we'll get over that.""Meanwhile, I'm going to get this alloy-selectivity investigated rightdown to the last nub," said Don. "Charley's gang can take it from allangles and record their findings. We'll ultimately be able to devisea system of mathematics for it from their analysis. You won't mindbeing bothered every fifteen minutes for the first week, will you, Wes?They'll be running to you in your sleep with questions until they catchup with your present level of ability in this job. Eventually they'llpass you up, and then you'll have to study their results in order tokeep up.""Suits me. That sounds like my job anyway.""It is. O.K., Arden, I'm coming now.""It's about time," smiled Arden. "I wouldn't haul you away from yourfirst love excepting that I know you haven't eaten in eight or ninehours. I've got roast knolla.""S'long, fellows," grinned Channing. "I'm one of the few guys in theinner system who can forget that the knolla is the North Venus brotherto a pussy cat.""I could feed you pussy cat and you'd eat it if I called it knolla,"said Arden. "But you wouldn't eat knolla if I called it pussy cat.""You can't tell the difference," said Walt."Tell me," asked Wes, "what does pussy cat taste like?""I mean by visual inspection. Unfortunately, there can be no comparisondrawn. The Venusians will eat pussy cat, but they look upon the knollaas a household pet, not fit for Venusian consumption. So unless werevive one of the Ancient Martians, who may have the intestinalfortitude--better known as guts--to eat both and describe thedifference, we may never know," offered Walt."Stop it," said Arden, "or you'll have my dinner spoiled for me.""All the more for me," said Don. "Now, when I was in college, we cookedthe dean's cat and offered it to some pledges under the name of knolla.They said--""We'll have macaroni for dinner," said Arden firmly. "I'll never beable to look a fried knolla in the pan again without wondering whetherit caterwauled on some back fence in Chicago, or a Palanortis Whitewoodon Venus."She left, and Channing went with her, arguing as he went to the effectthat she should develop a disregard for things like their discussion.As a matter of interest, Channing had his roast knolla that evening, sohe must have convinced Arden.Walt said: "And then there were three. Christine, has our littlepre-dinner talk disturbed your appetite?""Not in the least," said the girl stoutly. "I wouldn't care whether itwas knolla or pussy cat. I've been on Mars so long that either one ofthe little felines is alien to me. What have you to offer?""We'll hit Joe's for dinner, which is the best bar in sixty millionmiles today. Later we may take in the latest celluloid epic, and thenthere will be a bit of mixed wrestling in the ballroom.""Mixed wres--Oh, you mean dancing. Sounds interesting. Now?""Now. Wes, what are you heading for?""Oh, I've got on a cockeyed schedule," said Wes. "I've been catching mysleep at more and more out-of-phase hours until this is not too longafter breakfast for me. You birds all speak of 'Tomorrow,' 'Today' and'Yesterday' out here, but this business of having no sun to come up inthe morning, and the electric lights running all the time has me allbollixed up.""That daily nomenclature is purely from habit," said Walt. "As youknow, we run three equal shifts of eight hours each, and therefore whatmay be 'Morning' to Bill is 'Noon' to James and 'Night' to Harry. Itis meaningless, but habitual to speak of 'Morning' when you mean 'Justafter I get up!' Follow me?""Yup. This, then, is morning to me. Run along and have fun.""We'll try," said Walt."We will," said Christine.Farrell grinned as they left. He looked at Walt, and said: "You will!"Walt wondered whether he should have questioned Wes about that remark,but he did not. Several hours later, Walt wondered how Wes could havebeen so right.       *       *       *       *       *Interplanetary Communications, Preferred, started in its long climb assoon as the markets opened, on the following day. Cartright, followinghis orders and his experience, held onto whatever stock he had, andbought whatever stock was tossed his way. Several times he was on theverge of asking Interplanetary Transport for monetary assistance, butthe real need never materialized.Kingman alternately cursed the whining music and cheered the pyramidingstock. About the only thing that kept Kingman from going completely madwas the fact that the alien music was not continuous, but it came andwent in stretches of anything from five to fifty minutes, with variedperiods of silence in between selections.Up and up it went, and Kingman was seeing the final, victorious coupin the offing. A week more, and Venus Equilateral would belong toTerran Electric. The beam from Terra was silent, save for a few itemsof interest not connected with the market. Kingman's men were giventhe latest news, baseball scores, and so forth, among which items wasanother message to Channing from the solar beam project engineer,Addison. They had about given up. Nothing they could do would preventthe formation of ozone by the ton as they drew power by the kilowattfrom Sol.On Venus Equilateral, Channing said: "Ask Charley what his radiofrequency is."Ten minutes later, at the speed of light, the ship beam reached the_Relay Girl_ and the message clicked out. Charley Thomas read it, andspoke into the microphone. The _Relay Girl_ bucked unmercifully, asthe voice amplitude made the acceleration change. Then at the speed oflight, squared, the answer came back in less than a twinkle."Seventeen hundred kilocycles."Channing began to turn the tuner of the radio receiver. The band wasdead, and Channing laughed. "This is going to be tricky, what withthe necessity of aligning both the driver-alloy disk and the radioreceiver. Takes time."He changed the alloy disk in minute increments, and waved the tuneracross that portion of the band that would most likely cover theexperimental error of Charley Thomas' frequency measurement. A burstof sound caught his ear, was lost for a moment, and then swelled intoperfect tune as Don worked over the double tuning system."Whoa, Tillie," said Walt. "That sounds like--""Like hell.""Right. Just what I was going to say. Is it music?""Could be. I've got a slightly tin ear, you know.""Mine is fair," said Walt, "but it might as well be solid brass as faras this mess is concerned. It's music of some kind, you can tell it bythe rhythm. But the scale isn't anything like I've heard before.""Might be a phonograph record played backward," suggested Wes."I doubt it," said Channing seriously. "The swell of that orchestraindicates a number of instruments--of some cockeyed kind or other--thepoint I'm making is that anything of a classical or semi-classicalnature played backwards on a phonograph actually sounds passable. Ican't say the same for jamstead music, but it holds for most of theclassics, believe it or not. This sounds strictly from hunger.""Or hatred. Maybe the musicians do not like one another.""Then they should lambaste one another with their instruments, notpaste the sub-ether with 'em."Channing lit a cigarette. "Mark the dial," he said. "Both of 'em. I'vegot to get in touch with the Thomas Boys."Walt marked the dials and tuned for the _Relay Girl_. He found itcoming in not far from the other setting. Charley was speaking, andthey tuned in near the middle of his speech."--this thing so that it will not buck like a scenic railwayfinding the fourth derivative of space with respect to time. For mynontechnical listeners, that is none other than the better known term:Jerkiness. We applied the modulation in to the first driver anode--thelittle circular one right above the cathode. I don't know whether thisis getting out as it should, so I'm going to talk along for the nextfifteen minutes straight until I hear from you. Then we're switchingover and repeating. Can you hear me?"Channing cut the gain down to a whisper and put a message on the beam,confirming his reception. Ten minutes later, Charley changed his setspeech, and said: "Good! Too bad we haven't got one of those receivershere, or we could make this a two-way with some action. Now listen,Don. My idiot brother says he can make the beam transmit without thedrive. Unfortunately, I am not a driver expert like he is and so I cannot remonstrate with the half-wit. So, and right now, we're cuttingthe supply voltage to the final focusing anode. Whoops! I just floatedoff the floor and the mike cable is all tangled up in my feet. Thisfree stuff is not as simple as the old fiction writers claimed it was.Things are floating all over the place like mad. The accelerometer saysexactly zero, and so you tell me if we are getting out. We're goingback on 1-G so that we can sit down again. That's better! Though theidiot--it's a shame to be forced to admit that one of your family ishalf-witted--didn't wait until we were in position to fall. I almostlanded on my head--which is where he was dropped as an infant. How wasit? Did you hear my manly voice whilst we were going free? Say 'No' sothat my idiot brother will not have anything to say about his brilliantmind. I'm out of breath and we're going back on that home recording ofFreddy saying, and I will let him quote, via acetate."The sound of a phonograph pickup being dropped on a record precededFreddy's voice saying: "One, two, three, four, test. One--"Channing cut the gain again. "That red-hot. I thought he was talkingall this time.""Not the Thomas Boys. That comes under the classification of 'Work'which they shun unless they can not get any kind of machine to do itfor them," laughed Walt.       *       *       *       *       *Walt turned the dials back to the unearthly symphony. "At C^2, thatmight come from Sirius," he said, listening carefully. "Sounds likeChinese.""Oh, now look," objected Don. "What off earth would a Chinese Symphonybe doing with a driver-modulator system?""Broadcasting--""Nope. The idea of detecting driver radiation is as old as the hills.If any culture had uncovered driver-beam transmission, we'd all havebeen aware of it. So far as I know, we, and the Terran Electric crowdare the only ones who have had any kind of an opportunity of workingwith this sub-etheric energy. Wes, have you another miniature of therelay tube handy?""Sure. Why?""I'm going to see if this stuff can be made directional. You'rebringing whatever it is into the place on a collector plate andslamming it into an input-terminal power-transmission tube. It goesacross the table to the relay tube, and is amplified, and then istossed across more table to the load-terminal tube, where the output isimpressed across your alloy disk. Right?""Right.""I want another relay tube. I'm going to use it for a directionalinput-beam, aligning it in the same way that Jim Baler and BarneyCarroll did their first find. The one that sucked power out of theelectric light, turned off the city hall, and so on. Follow?""Perfectly. Yes, I've got a couple of them. But they're not connectedlike Walt's set-up was.""Well, that three-tube system was built on sheer guesswork some timeago. We can tap in the relay tube and haul out a set of cables thatwill energize the first relay tube. Hang her on gymbals, and we'll gohunting.""Shall I have Freddy return?""Yes. We'll have Walton's gang build us up about six of these thingsjust as we have here.""That won't take long," said Walt. "They're working on the tuning disksnow, and we should have 'em by the time that Freddy gets back here.""But this wild and woolly music. It's alien!"Wes turned from the teletype and dug in the cabinet for the extra relaytube. He up-ended the chassis containing Walt's set-up, and beganto attach leads to the voltage supply, cabling them neatly and inaccordance with the restrictions on lead-capacities that some of theanodes needed."It's alien," said Wes in agreement. "I'm going to shut it off nowwhilst I tinker with the tube.""Wait a minute," said Don. "Here comes Jim. Maybe he'd like to hear it.""Hear what?" asked Jim Baler, entering the door."We've a Sirian Symphony," explained Don, giving Jim the background allthe way up to the present time. Jim listened, and then said:"As an engineer, I've never heard anything like that in my life before.But, as a student of ancient languages and arts and sciences, I have.That's Chinese.""Oh no!""Oh yes. But definitely.""Ye gods!""I agree.""But how--where--""And/or when?"Channing sat down hard. He stared at the wall for minutes. "Chinese.Oh, great, slippery, green, howling catfish!" He picked up the phoneand called the decoupler room where the messages were sorted as todestination upon their entry into the Station."Ben? Look, have we a ship beam on anything of Chinese registry?"Ben said wait a minute while he checked. He returned and said: "Four._The Lady of Cathay_, _The Mandarin's Daughter_, _The Dragoness_, and_The Mongol Maid_. Why?""Put a ship message on each of 'em, asking whether they have anyChinese music aboard.""And then what? They can't answer.""Make this an experimental request. If any of them are using anyrecordings of Chinese music, tell them to have their electronics chiefreplace the phonograph pickup with a microphone--disturbing absolutelynothing--and to reply as if we could hear them. Get me?""Can you? Hear 'em, I mean.""We hear something, and Jim says it's Chinese.""It's worth a try, then. See you later."       *       *       *       *       *"Will they?" asked Jim, interested in the workings of this idea."Sure. Ever since we steered the _Empress of Kolain_ out of the greasewith the first Station-to-ship beam, all three of the interplanetarycompanies have been more than willing to co-operate with any of ourrequests as long as we precede the message with the explanation that itis experimental. They'll do anything we ask 'em to, short of scuttlingthe ship.""Nice hookup. Hope it works.""So do I," said Wes. "This, I mean. I've got our directional gadgethooked up.""Turn it on."The wailing of the music came in strong and clear. Wes turned the inputtube on its support, and the music passed through a loud peak and diedoff on the far side to almost zero. Wes adjusted the mobile tube formaximum response and tightened a small set-screw. "It's a shame wehaven't got a nice set of protractors and gymbals," said Wes. "I hadto tear into the desk lamp to get that flexible pipe.""Small loss. She's directional, all right. We'll get the gymbals later.Right now I don't want this turned off because we may hear somethinginteresting--Whoops, it went off by itself!""Could we dare to hope?" asked Walt."Let's wait. They'll have to hitch the microphone on--""Give 'em a half hour, at least."Twenty minutes later, a strange voice came through the speaker."Dr. Channing, of Venus Equilateral? We have been contacted by yourorganization with respect to the possibility of your being able to hearthe intership communicator system. This seems impossible, but we arenot ones to question. The fact that you are in possession of the factsconcerning our love of the music of our ancestors is proof enough thatyou must have heard something. I presume that further information isdesired, and I shall wait for your return. This is Ling Kai Chaing,Captain of the _Lady of Cathay_.""We got it!" chortled Don. He did a war dance in the lab, and the restfollowed suit. Bits of wire and oddments of one sort or another filledthe air as the big, grown-up men did a spring dance and strewed thefloor with daintily thrown junk. At the height of the racket, Ardenand Christine entered--no, they were literally hauled in, completelysurrounded, and almost smothered.Arden fought herself free and said: "What's going on?""We've just contacted a ship in space.""So what? Haven't we been doing that for months?""They've just contacted us, too!""Huh?" asked Arden, her eyes widening."None other. Wait, I'll get an answer." Don contacted Ben, in thedecoupler room and said: "Ben, hang this line on the _Lady of Cathay's_beam, will you?""Is that her?""None other.""Go ahead. She's coupled."Don pecked out a message. "Please describe the intercommunicationsystem used by your ship in detail. We have heard you, and you are,therefore, the first ship to contact Venus Equilateral from spaceflight. Congratulations."Eight minutes later, the voice of Captain Chaing returned."Dr. Channing, I am handing the microphone over to Ling Wey, ourelectronics engineer, who knows the system in and out. He'll work withyou on this problem."Ling Wey said: "Hello. This is great. But I'm not certain of how it'sdone. The output of the phono system is very small, and certainly notcapable of putting out the power necessary to reach Venus Equilateralfrom here. However, we are using a wired-radio system at seventeenhundred and ninety kilocycles in lieu of the usual cable system. Thecrew all like music, and, therefore, we play the recordings of ourancestral musicians almost incessantly."He paused for breath, and Channing said: "Walt, tap out a messageconcerning the lead-length of the cables that supply the driver anodes.Have him check them for radio frequency pickup.""I get it." The 'type began to click.       *       *       *       *       *This communication was carried on for hour after hour. Don's guesswas right, it turned out; the lead that connected the first driveranode was tuned in wave length to almost perfect resonance with thefrequency of the wired-radio communicator system. Channing thanked themprofusely, and they rang off. Soon afterward the wailing, moaning musicreturned to the air."Wonder if we could get that without the radio," said Don."Don't know. We can pack the juice on in the amplifier and see, nowthat we have it tuned on the button," said Walt."It won't," said Wes. "I've been all across the dial of the alloy disk.Nothing at all.""O.K. Well, so what if it doesn't. We've still got us a ship-to-shipcommunications system. Hey! What was that?"_That_ was a pale, flat-sounding human voice saying: "Kingman! I. C.Pfd. has been at six hundred and nine for two days, now. What's ournext move?""Kingman!" exploded Channing. "Why, the ... the--""Careful," warned Arden. "There's a lady present.""Huh?""Her," said Arden pointing at Christine."Wait," said Walt. "Maybe he'll answer."Don fiddled with the dials for a full fifteen minutes, keeping themvery close to the spot marked, hoping that Kingman's answer might notbe too far out of tune. He gave up as the answer was not to be found,and returned to the original setting. Ten minutes later the voice said:"Kingman, where in the devil is my answer? I want to know what our nextmove is. There isn't a bit of V. E. stock available. Why don't youanswer?"Then, dimly in the background, a voice spoke to the operator of theinstrument. "Kingman's probably asleep. That terrible moaning-stuffhe's been complaining about makes him turn the thing off as soon asthe day's market is off. He--and the rest of that crew--can't standit. You'll have to wait until tomorrow's market opens before he'll belistening.""O.K.," said the operator, and the set went silent."Kingman!" said Don Channing in a low, hard voice. "So he's the brightguy behind this. I get it now. Somehow he discovered a detector, andhe's been playing the market by getting the quotations by sub-etherictransmission at C^2 and beating the Northern Landing market. And didyou get the latest bit of luck? Kingman still is unaware of the factthat we are onto him--and have perfected this C^2 transmission. Here'swhere he gets caught in his own trap!""How?""We're not in too bad shape for making good, honest two-ways out ofthis sub-ether stuff. Kingman is still behind because he hasn't got areturn line back to Terra--he must be using our beams, which gives us areturn edge.""Why not get him tossed into the clink?" asked Walt."That's practical. Besides, we're sitting in a great big pile of gravyright now. We can prove Kingman has been violating the law to embezzle,mulct, steal, commit grand larceny, and so on. We're going to take aswing at Mr. Kingman and at Terran Electric that they won't forget. Wecan't lose, because I'm not a good sportsman when I find that I've beentricked. We're going after Kingman in our own fashion--and if we lose,we're going to go tinhorn and cry for the gendarmes. I'm not proud.""What do you plan?""We'll put a horde of folks on the decoupler files with the code TerranElectric filed with the government office. We can get the code, andI'm of the opinion that Kingman wouldn't take time to figure out a newcode, so he'll be using the old one. As soon as we find a message inthat code that is either addressed to Terran Electric or pertains to I.C. Preferred stock, we'll start to intercept all such messages and use'em for our own good.""That's illegal.""Yup. But who's gonna holler? Kingman can't.""But suppose we lose--?""Kingman will not know we've been tricking him. Besides, we can't losewith two ways to get ahead of his one. Come on, fellows, we've got tohelp get the extra receivers together.""How are we going to cut through the Channing Layer?""Easy. That's where we'll use the relay stations at Luna, Deimos, andthe six portables that circle Venus.""I get it. O.K., Don, let's get to work.""Right. And we'd better leave a guy here to collect any moreinteresting messages from Kingman's crowd. We can tune it right on toKingman's alloy, and that'll make that music take the back seat. Weneed narrower selectivity.""Charley's gang will find that if it is to be found," smiled Walt."We're really on the track this time."       *       *       *       *       *A dead-black spaceship drifted across the face of Luna slowly, andits course, though apparently aimless, was the course of a ship or aman hunting something. It darted swiftly, poised, and then zigzaggedforward, each straight-side of the jagged course shorter than the onebefore. It passed over a small crater and stopped short.Below, there was a spaceship parked beside a driver tube anchored inthe pumice.The black ship hovered above the parked ship, and then dropped sharply,ramming the observation dome on top with its harder, smaller bottom.The two ships tilted and fell, crushing the ground near the poiseddriver tube. Space-suited men assaulted the damaged ship, broke intothe bent and battered plates and emerged with three men who were stillstruggling to get their suits adjusted properly.Channing's men took over the poised driver tube, and in their own ship,Walt spoke over a sub-ether radio of a different type."Don, we got him."Don answered from Venus Equilateral, and his voice had no more delaythan if he had been within a hundred yards of the crater on Luna."Good. Stay there; you can contact the Lunar Relay Station from there.Wes is all ready on Station 3 above Northern Landing with his set, andJim Baler is at the Deimos Station.""Hi, Walt," came Wes' voice."Hi," said Jim Baler."Hello, fellows," said Walt. "Well, what cooks?""Kingman," said Channing. "You've got your orders, Walt. When Kingmanexpects the market to go down, tell him it's still going up. We'llfigure this out as we go along, but he won't like it at all."There was silence for a few minutes, and then Don said: "Walt,Kingman's sent a message through the Northern Landing station now. Hesays: 'Dump a block to shake the suckers loose. This is pyramided sohigh that they should all climb on the sell-wagon; running the marketdown of their own weight. When it hits a new low, we'll buy, and thistime end up by having control.' When he starts to run the market down,you buy at Terra."Minutes later, the message hit the Terra market, and Kingman's agentstarted to unload. The stock started off at six hundred and nine, andit soon dropped to five-forty. It hovered there, and then took anothergradual slide to four-seventy. Then a message came through the regularbeam station which Walt intercepted, decoded with Terran Electric's owncode book, and read as follows:"I. C. Preferred coming in fast. Shall we wait?"Walt chuckled and spoke into the driver modulator. "Kingman," hesaid, "some wiseacre is still buying. I. C. Preferred is running atseven-ninety! What now?"In the Venus Equilateral radio, he said: "Don, I just fixed him."From Venus, Wes said: "You sure did. He's just giving orders to dropsome more stock. This is too dirty to be funny, but Kingman asked forit. I know him. He's got this set up so that no one can do a thing onthis market program without orders from him. Too bad we can't withholdthe Northern Landing quotations from him."The Lunar Beam brought forth another message intended for Kingman'sinterceptor at Luna. "I. C. Preferred is dropping like a plummet. Whencan we buy?"Walt smiled and said into Kingman's set-up: "Kingman! I. C. Preferredis now at eight hundred and seventy!"Not many minutes later, Wes said: "That was foul, Walt. He's justgiven orders to run the market down at any cost.""O.K.," said Walt. "But he's going to go nuts when the Northern LandingExchange starts down without ever getting to that mythical ninehundred.""Let him wonder. Meanwhile, fellows, let's run ourselves a slide onTerran Electric. Sell the works!"Terran Electric started down just as I. C. Preferred took its thirddrop. It passed three hundred, and started down the two hundrednumbers. Walt shook his head and said to Kingman: "Kingman, we'regetting results now. She's dropped back again--to six hundred andthree." Then he said: "Kingman, someone is playing hob with T. E.Preferred. She's up to two hundred and fifty-one."To Don, Walt said: "Good thing that Kingman has that Sinese Chimphonyfor a bit of mood music, or he'd recognize my voice.""Which way will he jump?" laughed Don. "That was a slick bit ofKingman-baiting, Walt, in spite of your voice.""Kingman's taking it hard," said Wes. "We says to drop some of his ownstock so that they can use the money to manipulate the I. C. stuff.""O.K.," said Jim Baler. "This looks like a good time to think aboutbuying some of Kingman's stuff. Right?""Wait until his sales hit bottom," said Don. "Walt, tip us off.""O.K. What now?""Wait a bit and see."Terran Electric went down some more, and then Jim said: "Now?""Now," answered Don. "You too, Wes.""Me too?" asked Walt."You continue to sell!""Oh-oh," said Wes. "Kingman is wild. He wants to know what's the matterwith the market.""Tell him that your end is all right, and that I. C. Preferred is stillgoing down, but steady.""O.K.," said Walt.       *       *       *       *       *The hours went by, and Kingman became more and more frantic. I. C.Preferred would be reported at five hundred, but the Northern LandingExchange said two-ten. Meanwhile, Terran Electric--"Oh, lovely," said Don. "Beautiful. We've got us a reciprocating marketnow, better than Kingman's. When she's up at Terra, they're down atCanalopsis and Northern Landing--and vice versa. Keep it pumping, boys,and we'll get enough money to buy Kingman out."The vacillating market went on, and Don's gang continued to rock theTerran Electric stock. Then as the market was about to close for theday, Don said: "Sell 'em short!"Terran Electric stock appeared on the market in great quantities. Itsvalue dropped down and down and down, and Kingman, appraised of thefall by Walt, who magnified it by not less than two to one, apparentlygot frantic again, for he said:"We're running short. Drop your Terran stock to bolster the I. C. job!""Oh, lovely," said Don."You said that.""I repeat it. Look, fellows, gather all the T. E. Preferred and I. C.Preferred you can. Walt, tell him that Terran Electric is droppingfast, so he'll scuttle more of his stuff, and we'll pick it up slowlyenough so that we won't raise the market. How're we fixed for I. C.Preferred?""Not too bad. Can we hit him once more?""Go ahead," said Don."Kingman," said Walt. "Kingman! Hell's loose. The InterplanetaryBureau of Criminal Investigations has just decided to look into theInterplanetary Communications angle. They want to know who's trying tograb control of a public carrier!"Minutes later, Wes said: "Oh, Brother Myrtle. That did it. He just gaveorders to drop the whole thing short!""Wait until I. C. Preferred hits a new low and then we'll buy," saidDon.The flurry dropped I. C. Preferred to forty-seven, and then the agentsof Venus Equilateral stepped forth and offered to buy, at the market,all offered stock.They did.Then, as no more stock was offered, Interplanetary CommunicationsPreferred rose sharply to ninety-four and stabilized at that figure.Terran Electric stock went through a valley, made by Kingman's sales,and then headed up, made by purchases on Terra, on Mars, and on Venus.Don said: "Look, fellows, this has gone far enough. We have controlagain, and a goodly hunk of Terran Electric as well. Enough, I think,to force them to behave like a good little company and stay out ofother people's hair. Let's all get together and celebrate.""Right," echoed the men.       *       *       *       *       *A month later, Joe's was the scene of a big banquet. Barney Carrollstood up and said:"Ladies and gentlemen, we all know why we're here and what we'recelebrating, so I won't have to recount the whole affair. We all thinkDon Channing is a great guy, and Walt Franks is not far behind, if any.I'm pretty likable myself, and my lifelong sparring partner Jim Baleris no smelt, either. And so on, ad infinitum."But, ladies and gentlemen, Don Channing has a dark, deep, dire,desperate phase of his life, one that he will be remembered and cursedfor; one that will weigh about his neck like a milestone--or is itmillstone?--for all his life."Benefactor though he is, this much you shall know; I still say thatthere is no place in the inner system for a man who has made thispossible. Listen!"Barney raised his hand, and an attendant turned a standard, living roommodel radio receiver on. It burst into sound immediately."Ladies and gentlemen, the Interplanetary Network now brings to you theWhitewood Nutsies Program. Karven and Norwal, the Venusian Songbirds;Thalla; and Lillas, in person, coming to you from the jungles ofPalanortis, on Venus, by courtesy of the Inter-planet Foods Co. ofBattle Creek, Michigan!"Ladies and gentlemen, Whitewood Nutsies are _GOOD_ for you--"Walt Franks said to Christine: "Let's get out of here."Christine inspected Walt carefully. Then nodded. "Yup," she grinned."Even you sound better than the Interplanetary Network!"For once, Walt did not argue, having gained his point.                                THE END
