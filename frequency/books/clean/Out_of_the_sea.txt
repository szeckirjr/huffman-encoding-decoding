                            OUT OF THE SEA                           By Leigh Brackett           [Transcribers Note: This etext was produced from                    Astonishing Stories, June 1942.

He was down to hislast five dollars and quart of Scotch. His girl Madge had sketched himcategorically in vitriol, and married somebody else. His job on theLos Angeles _Observer_ was, like all the jobs hed ever had, finally,definitely, and for all time, cancelled.Being Webb Fallon, he was playing a fast game of doubles on thevolley-ball court at Santa Monica Beach, letting the sun and the saltair clear off a hangover.When he came off the court, feeling fine and heading for the water, bigChuck Weigal called to him.So the _Observer_ finally got wise to you, huh? How come?Fallon grinned, his teeth white against the mahogany burn of hishard, lean oval face. His corded body gleamed in the hot sun, and hisslanting grey-green eyes were mockingly bright.If you must know, he said, I was busy drowning my sorrows on thenight of the big quake, two weeks ago. I didnt know anything about ituntil I read the papers next morning. The boss seemed to think I was alittle--er--negligent.Weigal grunted. I dont wonder. A quake as bad as the Frisco one, andyou sleep through it! Phew!Fallon grinned, and went on. About half-way down the beach a brightyellow bathing suit caught his eye. He whistled softly and followed itinto the water. After all, now that Madge was gone....He knew the girl by sight. Fallon had an eye for blonde hair andDiana-esque figures. That was one thing Madge and he had fought about.The girl swam like a mermaid. Fallon lengthened his stroke, came upbeside her, and said, Hello.She blinked salt water out of sapphire blue eyes and stared. I knowyou, she said. Youre Webb Fallon.Im flattered.You neednt be. I know a girl named Madge, too.Oh. Fallons grey-green eyes narrowed. His lean face looked suddenlyugly, like a mean dog. Or more like a wolf, perhaps, with his thinstraight lips and slanting eyes.What did Madge tell you about me? he asked softly.She said you were no good. The blue eyes studied his face. And,added the girl deliberately, I think she was right.Yeah? said Fallon, very gently. He hadnt yet got over his cold rageat being jilted for a dull, prosperous prig. The girls face was likea mask cut out of brown wood and set with hard sapphires. He made atigerish, instinctive movement toward it.A wave took them unawares, knocked them together and down in astruggling tangle. They broke water, gasping in the after-swirl.Then, quite suddenly, the girl screamed.It was a short scream, strangled with sea-water, but it set the hairsprickling on Fallons neck. He looked past the girl, outward.Something was rising out of the sea.       *       *       *       *       *Webb Fallon, standing shoulder-deep in the cold water, stared in atemporary paralysis of shock. The thing simply couldnt be.There was a snout armed with a wicked sword. That and the head behindit were recognizable as those of a swordfish. But the neck behind themwas long and powerful, and set on sloping shoulders. Members likeelongated fins just becoming legs churned the surface. A wholly piscinetail whipped up gouts of spray behind the malformed silver body.Fallon moved suddenly. He grabbed the girl and started toward shore.The Thing emitted a whistling grunt and surged after them.Waves struck them; the aftersuck pulled at their legs. They floundered,like dreamers caught in nightmare swamps. And Fallon, through thethrashing and the surf and the sea-water in his ears, began to hearother sounds.There was a vast stirring whisper, a waking and surging of thingsdriven up and out. There were overtones of cries from unearthlythroats. Presently, then, there were human screams.Fallons toes found firm sand. Still clutching the girl, he splashedthrough the shallows. He could hear the wallowing thunder of creaturesbehind them, and knew that they had to run. But he faltered, staring,and the girl made a little choked sound beside him.The shallow margin of the sea was churned to froth by a nightmarehorde. The whole broad sweep of the beach was invaded by things that,in that stunned moment, Fallon saw only as confused shadows.He started to run, toward the hilly streets beyond the beach. Thecreature with the swordfish snout was almost on them. A fish, out ofthe sea! It reared its snaky neck and struck down.Fallon dodged convulsively. The sword flashed down and buried itself inthe sand not five inches from his foot.It never came out of the sand. A tail-less, stub-legged thing withthree rows of teeth in its shark-like jaws fastened onto the creaturesneck, and there was hot mammalian blood spilling out.They ran together, Fallon and the girl. The summer crowds fillingthe beaches, the promenade, the hot-dog stands and bath-houses, werefighting in blind panic up the narrow streets to the top of the bluff.It was useless to try to get through. Fallon made for an apartmenthouse.Briefly, in clear, bright colors, he saw isolated scenes. A starfishtwenty feet across wrapping itself around a woman and her stupefiedchild. A vast red crab pulling a man to bits with its claws. Somethingthat might once have been an octopus walking on four spidery legs, itsremaining tentacles plucking curiously at the volley-ball net thatbarred its way.The din of screaming and alien cries, the roar of the crowds and theslippery, thrashing bodies melted into dull confusion. Fallon and thegirl got through, somehow, to the comparative safety of the apartmenthouse lobby.They found an empty place by a bay window and stopped. Fallons legswere sagging, and his heart was a leaping pain. The girl crumpled upagainst him.They stared out of the window, dazed, detached, like spectatorswatching an imaginative motion-picture and not believing it.       *       *       *       *       *There was carnage outside, on the broad sunlit beach. Men and women andchildren died, some caught directly, others trampled down and unable toescape. But more than men were dying.Things fought and ate each other. Things of mad distortion of familiarshapes. Things unlike any living creature. Normal creatures grown outof all sanity. But all coming, coming, coming, like a living tidal wave.The window went in with a crash. A womans painted, shrieking faceshowed briefly and was gone, pulled away by a simple marine worm grownlong as a man. The breeze brought Fallon the stench of blood and fish,drowning the clean salt smell.Weve got to get out of here, he said. Come on.The girl came, numbly. Neither spoke. There was, somehow, nothing tosay. Fallon took down a heavy metal curtain rod, holding it like a club.The front doors had broken in. People trampled through in the blindstrength of terror. Fallon shrugged.No way to get past them, he said. Stay close to me. And for Godssake, dont fall down.The girls wet blonde head nodded. She took hold of the waistband ofhis trunks, and her hand was like ice against his spine.Out through broken doors into a narrow street, and then the crowdspread out a little, surging up a hillside. Police sirens werebeginning to wail up in the town.Down below, the beaches were cleared of people. And still the thingscame in from the sea. Fallon could see over the Santa Monica Pier now,and the broad sweep of sand back of the yacht harbor was black withsurging bodies.Most of the yachts were sunk. The bell-buoy had stopped ringing.The sunlight was suddenly dim. Fallon looked up. His grey-green eyeswidened, and his teeth showed white in a snarl of fear.Thundering in on queer heavy wings, their bodies hiding the sun, werebeasts that stopped his heart in cold terror.They had changed, of course. The bat-like wings had been broadenedand strengthened. They must, like the other sea-born monsters, havedeveloped lungs.But the size was still there! Five to ten feet in wing-spread--andbehind, the thin, deadly, whip-like tails.Rays! The queer creatures that fly bat-like under water--now thunderinglike giant bats through the air!There were flying fish wheeling round them like queer rigid birds. Theyhad grown legs like little dragons, and long tails.A pair of huge eels slid over the rough earth, pulled down a man andfought over the body. Policemen began to appear, and there was apopping of guns. The sirens made a mad skirling above the din.Some of the rays swooped to the crowded beach. Others came on, scentinghuman food.Guns began to crack from the cliff-tops, from the windows of apartmenthouses. Fallon caught the chatter of sub-machine guns. One of the rayswas struck almost overhead.It went out of control like a fantastic plane and crashed into thehillside, just behind Fallon and the girl. Men died shrieking underits twenty-foot, triangular bulk.It made a convulsive leap.The girl slipped in the loose rubble, and lost her hold on Fallon. Thebroad tentacles on the rays head closed in like the horns of a halfmoon, folding the girl in a narrowing circle of death.       *       *       *       *       *Fallon raised his iron curtain rod. He was irrationally conscious,with a detached fragment of his brain, of the girls sapphire eyes andthe lovely strength of her body. Her face was set with terror, but shedidnt scream. She fought.Something turned over in Fallons heart, something buried andunfamiliar. Something that had never stirred for Madge. He stepped in.The bar swung up, slashed down.The leathery skin split, but still the feelers hugged the girl closer.The great ray heaved convulsively, and something whistled past Fallonshead. It struck him across the shoulders, and laid him in dazed agonyin the dirt.The creatures tail, lashing like a thin long whip.Webb Fallon got up slowly. His back was numb. There was hot bloodflooding across his skin. The girls eyes were blue and wide, fixed onhim. Terribly fixed. She had stopped fighting.Fallon found an eye, set back on one of the tentacles. He set the endof the iron rod against it, and thrust downward....Whether it was the rod, or the initial bullet, Fallon never knew, butthe tentacles relaxed. The girl rose and came toward him, and togetherthey went up the hill.They were still together when sweating volunteers picked them up andcarried them back into the town.Fallon came to before they finished sewing up his back. The emergencyhospital was jammed. The staff worked in a kind of quiet frenzy, witha devils symphony of hysteria beating up against the windows of thewards.They hadnt any place to keep Fallon. They taped his shoulders into akind of harness to keep the wound closed, and sent him out.The girl was waiting for him in the areaway, huddled in a blanket. Theyhad given Fallon one, too, but his cotton trunks were still clammy coldagainst him. He stood looking down at the girl, his short brown hairunkempt, the hard lines of his face showing sharp and haggard.Well, he said. What are you waiting for?To thank you. You saved my life.Youre welcome, said Fallon. Now youd better go before Icontaminate you.Thats not fair. I am grateful, Webb. Truly grateful.Fallon would have shrugged, but it hurt. All right, he said wearily.You can tell Madge what a little hero I was.Please dont leave me, she whispered. I havent any place to go. Allmy clothes and money were in the apartment.He looked at her, his eyes cold and probing. Brief disappointmenttouched him, and he was surprised at himself. Then he went deeper, intothe clear sapphire eyes, and was ashamed--which surprised him even more.Whats your name? he asked. And why havent you fainted?Joan Daniels, she said. And I havent had time.Fallon smiled. Give me your shoulder, Joan, he said, and they wentout.                              CHAPTER TWO                        Catastrophe--or Weapon?Santa Monica was a city under attack. Sweating policemen struggledwith solid jams of cars driven by wild-eyed madmen. Horns hooted andblared. And through it all, like banshees screaming with eldritchmirth, the sirens wailed.Theyll declare martial law, said Fallon. I wonder how long they canhold those things back?Webb, whispered Joan, what _are_ those things?Strangely, they hadnt asked that before.Theyd hardly had time even to think it.Fallon shook his head. God knows. But its going to get worse. Hearthat gunfire? My apartment isnt far from here. Well get some clothesand a drink, and then....It was growing dark when they came out again. Fallon felt better, witha lot of brandy inside him and some warm clothes. Joan had a pair ofhis slacks and a heavy sweater.He grinned, and said, Those never looked as nice on me.Soldiers were throwing up barricades in the streets. The windows ofCorbins big department store were shattered, the bodies of dead rayslying in the debris. The rattle of gunfire was hotter, and much closer.Theyre being driven back, murmured Fallon.A squadron of bombers droned over, and presently there was the _crump_and roar of high explosives along the beaches. The streets were fairlyclear now, except for stragglers and laden ambulances, and the thinninggroups of dead.Fallon thought what must be happening in the towns farther south, withtheir flat low beaches and flimsy houses. How far did this invasionextend? What was it? And how long would it last?He got his car out of the garage behind the apartment house. Joan tookthe wheel, and he lay down on his stomach on the back seat.His back hurt like hell.One good thing, he remarked wryly. The finance company wont bechasing me through this. Just go where the traffic looks lightest, andshout if you need me.He went to sleep.It was morning when he woke. Joan was asleep on the front seat, curledup under a blanket. She had spread one over him, too.Fallon smiled, and looked out.The first thing he noticed was the unfamiliar roar of motors overhead,and the faint crackling undertone of gunfire. They were still undersiege, then, and the defenders were still giving ground.They were parked on Hollywood Boulevard near Vine. Crowds ofwhite-faced, nervous people huddled along the streets. The onlyactivity was around the newsboys.Fallon got out, stiff and cursing, and went to buy a paper. An extraarrived before he got there. The boy ripped open the bundle, let out astartled squawk, and began to yell at the top of his lungs.A low, angry roar spread down the boulevard. Fallon got a paper, andsmiled a white-toothed, ugly smile. He shook Joan awake and gave herthe paper.Theres your answer. Read it.       *       *       *       *       *She read aloud: Japs Claim Sea Invasion Their Secret Weapon!Only a few minutes ago, the Amalgamated Press recorded an officialbroadcast from Tokyo, declaring that the fantastic wave of monsterswhich have sprung from the ocean at many points along the Western Coastwas a new war-weapon of the Axis which would cause the annihilation ofAmerican and world-wide democratic civilization.The broadcast, an official High Command communique, said in part: ThePacific is wholly in our hands. American naval bases throughout theocean are useless, and the fleet where it still exists is isolated. Inall cases our new weapon has succeeded. The Pacific states, with theislands, come within our natural sphere of influence. We advise them tosubmit peacefully.Joan Daniels looked up at Fallon. At first there was only stunnedpallor in her face. Then the color came, dark and slow.Submit peacefully! she whispered. So thats it. A cowardly,fiendish, utterly terrible perversion of warfare--something so horriblethat it....Yeah, said Fallon. Save it.He was leafing through the paper. There was a lot more--hurriedopinions by experts, guesses, conjectures, and a few facts.Fallon said flatly. They seem to be telling the truth. Fragmentaryradio messages have come in from the Pacific. Monsters attacked justas suddenly as they did here, and at about the same time. They simplyclogged the guns, smothered the men, and wrecked ground equipment bysheer weight of numbers.Joan shuddered. You wouldnt think....No, grunted Fallon. You wouldnt. He flung the paper down. Yah!Not an eyewitness account in the whole rag!Joan looked at him thoughtfully. She said, Well....They fired me once, he snarled. Why should I crawl back?It was your own fault, Webb. You know it.He turned on her, and again his face had the look of a mean dog.That, he said, is none of your damned business.She faced him stubbornly, her sapphire eyes meeting his slittedgrey-green ones with just a hint of anger.You wouldnt be a bad sort, Webb, she said steadily, if you werentso lazy and so hell-fired selfish!Cold rage rose in him, the rage that had shaken him when Madge told himshe was through. His hands closed into brown, ugly fists.Joan met him look for look, her bright hair tangling over the collarof his sweater, the strong brown curves of cheek and throat catchingthe early sunlight. And again, as it had in that moment on the cliff,something turned over in Fallons heart.What do you care, he whispered, whether I am or not?For the first time her gaze flickered, and something warmer than thesunlight touched her skin.You saved my life, she said. I feel responsible for you.Fallon stared. Then, quite suddenly, he laughed. You fool, hewhispered. You damned little fool!He kissed her. And he kissed her gently, as he had never kissed Madge.They got breakfast. After that, Fallon knew, they should have goneeast, with the tense, crawling hordes of refugees. But somehow hecouldnt go. The distant gunfire drew him, the stubborn, desperateplanes.They went back, toward the hills of Bel Air. After all, there wasplenty of time to run.Things progressed as he had thought they would. Martial law wasdeclared. An orderly evacuation of outlying towns was going forward.Fallon got through the police lines with a glib lie about an invalidbrother. It wasnt hard--there was no danger yet the way he was going,and the police were badly overburdened.Fallon kept the radio on as he drove. There was a lot of wild talk--itwas too early yet for censorship. A big naval battle east of WakeIsland, another near the Aleutians. The defense, for the present, wasgetting nowhere.Up on the crest of a sun-seared hill, using powerful glasses from hiscar, Fallon shook his head with a slow finality.The morning mists were clearing. He had an unobstructed view ofHollywood, Beverly Hills, the vast bowl of land sloping away to thesea. The broad boulevards to the east were clogged with solid blackstreams. And to the west....       *       *       *       *       *To the west there were barricades. There were clouds of powder smoke,and fleets of low-flying planes. And there was something else.Something like a sluggish, devouring tide, lapping at the walls of thehuge M-G-M studios in Culver City, swamping the tarmac at Clover Field,flowing resistlessly on and on.Bombs tore great holes in the restless sea, but they flowed in uponthemselves and were filled. Big guns ripped and slashed at the swarmingcreatures. Many died. But there were always more. Many, many more.The shallow margin of the distant ocean was still churned to froth.Still the things came out of it, surging up and on.Fighting, spawning, dying--and advancing.Joan Daniels pressed close against him, shuddering. It just isntpossible, Webb! Bombers, artillery, tanks, trained soldiers. And wecant stop them! She stiffened suddenly. Webb! she cried. Lookthere!Where the bombers swooped through the smoke, another fleet was coming.A fleet of flat triangular bodies with bat-like wings, in numbers thatclouded the sun. Rays, blind and savage and utterly uncaring.Machine guns brought them down by the hundred, but more of them came.They crashed into heavy ships, fouled propellers, broke controls.Joan looked away, And there are so few planes, she whispered.Fallon nodded. The whole coast is under attack, remember, fromVancouver to Mexico. There just arent enough men, guns, or planes togo round. More are coming from the east, but.... He shrugged and wassilent.Then--then you think well have to surrender?Doesnt look hopeful, does it? Japan in control of the Pacific, andthis here. Well hold out for a while, of course. But suppose thesethings come out of the sea indefinitely?Weve got to assume they can. Joans eyes were dark and very tired.Whats to prevent Japan from loaning her weapon to her friends? Thinkof these things swarming in over England.War, said Fallon somberly. A hell of a long, rotten war.He leaned against the car, his grey-green eyes half closed. The breezecame in from the sea, heavy with the stench of amphibian bodies. Theradio droned on. The single deep line between Fallons straight browsgrew deeper. He began to talk, slowly, to Joan.The experts say that the Little Brown Brothers must have some kindof a movable projector capable of producing rays which upset theevolutionary balance and cause abnormal growth. Rays like hard X-rays,or the cosmic rays that govern reproduction.California Tech has dissected several types of monsters. They say thatindividual cell groups are affected, causing spontaneous growth inliving individuals, and that metabolism has been enormously speeded, sothat life-cycles which normally took years now take only a few weeks.They also say that huge numbers--the bulk of these creatures--aremutants, new individuals changed in the egg or the reproductive cell.All these monsters are growing and spawning at a terrific tempo.Billions of eggs, laid and hatched, even with the high mortality rate.Theyre evolving, at a fantastic rate of speed. Theyre growing legsand lungs and becoming mammals. Theyre coming out of the sea, justas our ancestors did millions of years ago. Theyre coming fast, andtheyre hungry.He fixed the girl suddenly with a bright, sharp stare.Do you think a thing as big as that is man-made?       *       *       *       *       *There was a grim, stony weariness in her face. The Japanese say so.What other explanation is there?But, said Fallon, why not South America, too?They were probably afraid the monsters might get out of hand andtackle their own people, said Joan bitterly.Maybe. Again Fallons eyes were distant. Then he clapped his handssharply and sprang up. Yes! Got it, Joan!The quick motion ripped at the wound across his back. He swayed andcaught her shoulder, but he didnt stop talking.Einar Bjarnsson! He was my last job. I interviewed him the day beforethe quake. I want to see him, Joan. Now!She took his wrists, half frightened. What is it, Webb?Listen, he said softly. Remember the radio calls from the islands?The monsters came out of the west here, didnt they? Well, outthere--_they came out of the east_!Fallon explained, as he sent the car screaming perilously along windingmountain roads. Einar Bjarnsson was an expert on undersea life. He hadcharted tide paths and sub-sea rivers, mapped the continental shelvesand the great deeps.Bjarnssons recent exploration had been in the Pacific, using aspecially constructed small submarine. His findings on deep-seaphenomena had occupied space in scientific journals and the Sundaysupplements of newspapers throughout the world.Two days before the big quake Einar Bjarnsson returned to the placehe called home--a small bachelor cabin on a hilltop, crammed withscientific traps and trophies of his exploring. Webb Fallon drew theassignment of interviewing him.I was pretty sore at Madge, then, Fallon confessed, and I had aferocious hangover. The interview didnt go so well. But I rememberBjarnsson mentioning something about a volcanic formation quite closeto the Pacific coast--something nobody had noticed before. It wasapparently extinct, and the only thing that made it notable was itsrather unusual conformation.Joan stared at him. Whats that got to do with anything?Fallon shrugged. Maybe nothing. Only I recall that the epicenter ofthe recent quake was somewhere in the vicinity of Bjarnssons volcano.I remember that damned quake quite well, because it cost me my job.Joan opened her mouth and closed it again, hard. Fallon grinned.You were going to tell me it wasnt the quake, but my own badcharacter, he said mockingly.There was something grim in the upthrust lines of her jaw. I cantmake you out, Webb, she said quietly. Sometimes I think theres goodstuff in you--and then I think Madge was right!Fallons dark oval face went ugly, and he didnt speak again untilBjarnssons house came in sight.                             CHAPTER THREE                         Bjarnssons SubmarineFallon stopped the car and got out stiffly, feeling suddenly tired anddisinterested. He hesitated. Why bother with a crazy hunch? The rollingcrash of gunfire was getting closer. Why not forget the whole thing andgo while the going was good?He realized that Joan was watching him with sapphire eyes grown puzzledand hard. Damn it! he snarled. Stop looking at me as though I were abug under glass!Joan said, Is that Bjarnsson in the doorway?For the third time Fallons hands clenched in anger. Then he turnedsharply, white about the lips with the pain it cost him, and strode upto the small rustic cabin.Einar Bjarnsson remembered him. He stood aside, a tall stooped man withmassive shoulders and a gaunt, cragged face. Coarse fair hair shotwith grey hung in his eyes, which were small and the color of frozensea-water.He said, in a deep, slow voice, Come in. I have been watching throughmy telescope. Most interesting. But it gets too close now. I amsurprised you are here. Duty to your paper, eh?Fallon let it pass. He might get more out of Bjarnsson if the explorerthought he was still with the _Observer_. And then the thought struckhim--what was he going to do if his hunch was right?Nothing. He had no influence. The statesmen were handling things.Suppose Japan did take the Pacific States? Suppose there was a war? Hecouldnt do anything about it. Let the big boys worry. Thered be abeach somewhere that he could comb in peace.He made a half turn to go out again. Then he caught sight of a map onthe far wall--a map of the Pacific.Something took him to it. He put his finger on a spot north and east ofthe Hawaiian Islands. And even then he couldnt have said why he askedhis question.Your volcanic formation was about here, wasnt it, Bjarnsson?The tall Norseman stared at him with cold shrewd eyes. Yes. Why?Look here. Fallon drew a rough circle with his fingertip, touchingthe Pacific Coast, swinging across the ocean through the Gilberts andthe Marshalls, touching Wake, and curving up again to Vancouver.The volcanic formation is the center of that circle, Fallon said.It was also the epicenter of the recent quake, according to Cal-Techseismologists. Thats what gave me the hunch. The monsters seem to befanning out in a circle from some central point located about there.That is already explained, said Bjarnsson. The Japanese may havetheir projector located there. And why not?No reason at all, Fallon admitted. You mentioned, in your interview,something about a Japanese ocean survey ship coming up just as youleft. That ship might still have been near there at the time of thequake, mightnt it?It is possible. Go on. There was a little sharp flame flickering inBjarnssons eyes.Fallon said, Could these super-evolutionary rays be caused by volcanicaction?Bjarnssons grey-blond shaggy brows met, and the flame was sharper inhis eyes. Fantastic. But so is this whole affair.... Yes! If an areaof intense radioactivity were uncovered by an earth-shift, the sea andall that swims in it might be affected.Ah! Fallons lips were drawn in a tight grin. Suppose the officersof the Japanese ship saw the beginnings of the effect. Suppose theyradioed home, and someone did some quick thinking. Suppose, in short,that theyre lying._Ja_, whispered Bjarnsson. Let us think.Ive already thought, said Fallon. Two weeks would give them timeto arrange everything. The important thing is this--if the force isman-made, even destroying the projector wont do any good. Theyllhave others. But if it were a natural force, the psychological aspectof the thing alone would be tremendous. Thered be a chance of doingsomething.The explorers deep light eyes glinted. Our people would fight betterif it was something they _could_ fight. He swung to the big telescopemounted in the west windows. Bah! It gets worse. Those creatures, theydont know when they are dead. And the way they come! We must go soon.       *       *       *       *       *He swung back to Fallon. But how to find out if you are right?You have a submarine, said Fallon.So has the Navy.But theyre all needed. Yours can go where the big ones cant--andgo deeper. These monsters are all heading for land, which means theygravitate to the surface. You might get through below.Yes. Bjarnsson strode up and down the cluttered room. We could takea depth charge. If we found the volcano to be the cause, we might closethe fissure.Time, Fallon! That is the thing. A few days, a few weeks, and thesheer pressure of these hordes will have forced the defenders back tothe mountains and the deserts. Civilian morale will break.He stopped, making a sharp gesture of futility. I am forgetting. Theradiations, Fallon. Without proper insulation, we would evolve like thesea-things. And it would take many days to make lead armor for us, evenif we could get anyone to do the work.Radiations, said Fallon slowly. Yeah. Id forgotten that. Well, thatstops that. Projector or volcano, youd never reach it.He brushed a hand across his eyes, all his brief enthusiasm burnedaway. He was getting like that. He wished he had a drink.Probably all moonshine, anyway, he said. Anyhow, theres nothing wecan do about it.Nothing! Joan Daniels spoke so sharply that both men started. Youmean youre not even going to try?Bjarnsson can pass the idea along for what its worth.You know what that means, Webb! The idea would be either laughed at orpigeonholed, especially with the Jap propagandists doing such a goodjob. The governments got a war on its hands. Even if someone did payattention, nothing would be done until too late. It never is.She gripped his arms, looking up at him with eyes like sea-blue swords.If theres a bare chance of saving them, Webb, youve got to take it!Fallon looked down at her, his wolfs eyes narrowed.Listen, he said. Im not a fiction hero. Weve got an Army, a Navy,an air force, and a secret service. Theyre getting paid for riskingtheir necks. Let them worry. I had a hunch, which may not be worth adime. I passed it along. Now Im going to clear out, before anythingmore happens to me.Joans face was cut, sharp and bitter, from brown wood. Her eyes hadfire in them, way back.Your logic, she whispered, is flawless.I saved your life, said Fallon brutally. What more do you want?The color drained from the brown wood, leaving it marble. Only theangry fires in her eyes lived, in the pale hard stone.Youre remembering how I kissed you, said Fallon, so softly that hehardly spoke at all. I dont know why I did. I dont know why I camehere. I dont know....He stopped and turned to the door. Bjarnsson, very quietly, was pickingup the phone. Fallon took the knob and turned it.I am sorry, said a quiet, sibilant voice. You cannot leave. And you,sir--put down that telephone.       *       *       *       *       *A small neat man with a yellow face stood on the threshold. He washolding a small, neat, efficient-looking automatic. Fallon backed intothe room, hearing the click of the cradle as the phone went down.You are Einar Bjarnsson? The question was toneless and purelyrhetorical. The black eyes had seen the whole room in one swift flick.I am Kashimo, said the man, and waited.Fallon, Webb said easily. This is Miss Daniels. We just dropped infor a chat. Mind if we go now?I am afraid ... said Kashimo, and spread his hands. I have beendiscourteous enough to eavesdrop. You have an inventive mind, Mr.Fallon. An inaccurate mind, but one that might prove disturbing to ourplans.Dont worry, grunted Fallon. I have no business whatsoever, and Iattend to it closely. Your plans dont matter to me at all.Indeed. Kashimo studied him with black, bright eyes. You are eithera liar or a disgrace to your country, Mr. Fallon. But I may not takechances. You and the young lady I must, sadly, cancel out.And I? Bjarnsson asked.You come with us, said Kashimo. Fallon saw four other small neat menoutside, close behind their leader in the doorway.He said, What do you mean, cancel out? He knew, before Kashimomoved his automatic.Kashimo said, Mr. Bjarnsson, please to move out of the line of fire.No one moved. The room was still, except for Joans quick-caughtbreath. And then motion beyond the west windows caught Fallons eye. Acolder fear crawled in his heart, but his voice surprised him, it wasso steady.Kashimo. Look out there.The bright black eyes flicked warily aside. They widened sharply, andthe cords went slack about the jaw. Fallon sprang.He had forgotten the wound across his back. The shock of his bodystriking Kashimo turned him sick and faint. He knew that the little manfell, staggering the others so close behind him.He knew that Joan Daniels was shouting, and that Bjarnsson had caughtup an ebony war-club and was using it. Shots boomed in his ears. Butone sound kept him from fainting--the thunder of slow relentless giantwings.He got up in unsteady darkness. A round sallow face appeared. He struckat it. Bone cracked under his knuckles, and the face vanished. Fallonfound a wall and clung to it.Hands gripped his ankle--Kashimos hands. Bjarnsson was outside moppingup. Fallon braced himself and drew his foot back. His toe caughtKashimo solidly under the angle of the jaw.Joan, said Fallon. The wings were thundering closer. Joan didntanswer. A sort of queer panic filled Fallon.Joan! he cried. Joan!Here I am, Webb. She came from beyond the door, with a heavy littleidol in her hand. It had blood on it. Her golden hair was tumbled andher neck was bleeding where a bullet had creased it.Fallon caught her. He felt her wince under his hands. He didnt knowquite what he wanted, except that she must be safe.He only said, Hurry, before those things get here.The throb of wings was deafening. Bjarnsson came in, swinging his club.His cragged face was bloody, but his pale eyes blazed.Good man, Fallon, he grunted. All right, lets go. Theres a cavebelow here. Take their guns, young lady. Well need them.The sky beyond the west windows was clogged with huge black shapes.Fallon remembered the smashed windows of the department store in SantaMonica. Joan, he said, come here.He put his arm around her shoulders. He might have walked all rightwithout her, but somehow he wanted her there.       *       *       *       *       *They dropped down the other side of the hill into a little brush-chokedcleft. There was a shallow cave at one end.There go my windows, said Bjarnsson, and cursed in Swedish. In withyou, before those flying devils find us.They were well hidden. Chances were the rays would go right overthem--after theyd finished off Kashimo and his men. Bjarnsson saidsoftly, What did they want with me, Fallon?Theres only one thing they couldnt get from somebody else, returnedFallon. Your submarine.Yes. The mechanisms are of my own design. They would need me tooperate it. Does that mean we are right about the volcano?Maybe. Theyd have made plans to control it, of course. Or they maywant your ship merely as a model.There was silence for a while. Outside, heavy wings began to beatagain. They came perilously low, went over, and were gone.Einar Bjarnsson said quietly, Im going to take the chance, Fallon.Im going to try to get my ship through.What about the radiations?If Kashimo was planning to use the ship, hell have arranged for that.Anyway, Im going to see. His ice-blue eyes stabbed at Fallon. Icant do it alone.Joan Daniels said, Ill go.Bjarnssons eyes flicked from one to the other. Fallons face was darkand almost dangerous.Wait a minute, he said gently.Joan faced him. I thought you were going away.Ive changed my mind. Looking at her, at her blue, unsympatheticeyes, Fallon wondered if he really had. Perhaps the stunning shock ofall that had happened had unsettled him.Joan put both hands on his shoulders and looked straight into his eyes.What kind of a man are you, Webb Fallon?God knows, he said. Where do you keep your boat, Bjarnsson?In a private steel-and-concrete building at Wilmington. Some of theimprovements are of interest to certain people. I keep them lockedsafely away. Or so I thought.Fallon rose stiffly. Kashimo didnt come in a car, thats certain.Hed have been arrested on sight. Any place for a plane to land nearhere?The explorer shook his head. Unless it could come straight down.Fallon snapped his finger. A helicopter! Thats it.He led the way out. They found the copter on a small level spacebeyond the shoulder of the hill. Fallon nodded.Ingenious little chaps. The ships painted like an Army plane. Anypilot would think it was a special job and let it severely alone. Heturned abruptly to Joan.Take my car, he told her. Get away from here, fast. Find someone inauthority and make him listen--just in case.She nodded. Webb, why are you going?Because there isnt time to get anyone else, he told her roughly.Because theres a story there....He stopped, startled at what he had said. Yes, he said slowly, astory. My story. Oh hell, why did you have to come along?He put his hands suddenly back of her head and tilted her face up, hisfingers buried in the warm curls at the base of her neck.I was all set, he whispered savagely. I knew all the answers. Andthen you showed up. If you hadnt, Id be half-way to Miami by now. Idstill be sure of myself. I wouldnt be so damned confused, thinking oneway and feeling another....She kissed him suddenly, warmly. Ill make somebody listen, she said.And then Ill wait--and pray.Then she was gone. In a minute he heard the car start.Come on, he snarled at Bjarnsson. I remember you said you fly.                             CHAPTER FOUR                         A Dead Man Comes BackIt was a nightmare trip. The battle below was terribly clear. Twicethey dodged flights of the giant rays, saved only because the scent offood kept the attention of the brutes on the ground.The harbor basin at Wilmington was choked with slippery, strugglingbeasts. There was hardly a sign of shipping. Bjarnsson made for theflat top of a square building, completely surrounded.A flight of rays went over just as they landed. A trap door in the roofraised and was slammed shut again.Now, said Fallon grimly, and jumped out.They were almost to the trap when a ray sighted them. Fallon shot itthrough the eye, but others followed. Bjarnsson wrenched up the trap. Asurprised yellow face peered up, vanished in a crimson smear.Bjarnsson hauled the body out and threw it as far as he could. The raysfought over it like monstrous gulls over a fish head.Fallen retched and followed Bjarnsson down.There were three other men in the building. One tried to shoot it outand was killed. The others were mechanics, with no stomachs for theguns.They looked over the sub, a small stubby thing of unusual design, andBjarnsson nodded his gaunt shaggy head.These suits of leaded fabric, he said. One big, for me. The othersmaller, for Kashimo, perhaps. Can you get into it?Fallon grunted. I guess so. Hey! Look there.Ha! A depth charge, held in the claws I use for picking specimens fromthe ocean floor. They have prepared well, Fallon.You know what that means! Fallon was aware of a forgotten, surgingexcitement. His palms came together with a ringing crack.I was right! Kashimo was going to hold you here until the Governmentcapitulated. Then he was going out to shut off the power. Theresno projector, Bjarnsson. It _was_ the volcano. If we can close thatfissure while theres still resistance, well have em licked!Bjarnssons ice-blue eyes fixed Fallon with a sharp, unwavering stare,and he spoke slowly, calmly, almost without expression.It will take about three days to get there, working together. One fitof cowardice or indecision, one display of nerves or temper may destroywhat slight chance we have.You mean, said Fallon, you wish you had someone you could dependon. He smiled crookedly. Ill do my best, Bjarnsson.They struggled into the clumsy lead armor and shuffled into the smallcontrol room of the submarine. Everything had been prepared in advance.In a few seconds, automatic machinery was lowering the sub into itsslip.Water slapped the hull. Bjarnsson started the motors. They went forwardslowly, through doors that opened electrically.Ballast hissed and snarled into the tanks.Bjarnsson said, If we can get through this first pack, into deepwater, we may make it. He pointed to a knife-switch. Pull it.Fallon did. Nothing seemed to happen. Bjarnsson sat hunched over thecontrols, cold blue eyes fixed on the periscope screen. Fallon had aswift, horrible sense of suffocation--the steel wall of the sub curvinglow over his helmeted head, the surge of huge floundering bodies in thewater outside.Something struck the hull. The little ship canted. Fallon gripped hisseat with rigid, painful hands. Bjarnssons armored, unhuman shouldersmoved convulsively with effort. Fallon felt a raw panic scream risingin his throat....       *       *       *       *       *He choked it back. Heavy muffled blows shook the submarine. The motorschurned and shook. Fallon was afraid they were going to stop. Sweatdripped in his eyes, misted his helmet pane.The screws labored on. Fallon heard the tanks filling, and knew thatthey were going deeper. The blows on the hull grew fewer, fartherbetween. Fallon began to breath again.Einar Bjarnsson relaxed, just a little. His voice came muffled by hishelmet. The worst, Fallon--were through it.Fallons throat was as dry as his face was wet. But how?Sometimes, in the deeps, one meets creatures. Hungry creatures, aslarge even as this ship. So I prepared the hull. That switch transformsus into a travelling electric shock, strong enough to discourage almostanything. I hoped it would get us through.Thinking of what might have happened, Fallon shut his jaw hard. Hisvoice was unnaturally steady as he asked, What now?Now you learn to operate the ship, in case something should happen tome. Bjarnssons small blue eyes glinted through his helmet pane. Toobad there is not a radio here, Fallon, so that you might broadcast aswe go. As it is, I fear the world may miss a very exciting story.For Gods sake, said Fallon wearily, and he wasnt swearing. Letsnot make this any tougher. Okay. This is the master switch....In the next twenty-four hours, Fallon learned to handle the submarinepassably well. Built for a crew of two, the controls were fairlysimple, once explained. Nothing else was touched. The only extra switchthat mattered was the one that released the depth charge.For an endless, monotonous hell, Fallon stood watch and watch aboutwith Bjarnsson, one at the controls, one operating the batteryof observation scopes, never sleeping. They saved on oxygen asa precaution, which added to the suffocating discomfort of thehelmet-filters.Black, close, nerve-rasping hours crawled by, became days. At last,Fallon, bent over the scope screen, licked the sweat from his thinlips and looked at Bjarnsson, a blurred dark hulk against the dim glowof the half-seen instrument panel.Fallons head ached. The hot stale air stank of oil. His body was tiredand cramped and sweat-drenched, and the wound across his shouldersthrobbed. He looked at the single narrow bunk.There was nothing out there in the water but darkness. Even thedeep-sea fish had felt the impulse and avoided the sub. Fallon got up.Bjarnsson, he said, Im going to sleep.The explorer half turned in his seat._Ja?_ he said quietly.Theres nothing out there, growled Fallon. Why should I sit andglare at that periscope?Because, Bjarnsson returned with ominous gentleness, there might besomething. We will not reach the volcano for perhaps ten hours. You hadbetter watch.Fallons hard jaw set. I cant go any longer without sleep.Bjarnssons cragged face was flushed and greasy behind his helmet, buthis eyes were like glittering frost.All the whisky and the women, he whispered. They make you soft,Fallon. The girl would have been better.A flashing glimpse of Joan as she had looked in the car that morningcrossed the eye of Fallons mind--the tumbled fair hair and thesunlight warm on throat and cheek, and her voice saying, You wouldntbe bad, Webb ... so lazy and so hell-fired selfish!He cursed and started forward. The dark blur of Bjarnsson rose,blotting out the green glow. And then the panel light rose in ashuddering arc.Fallon thought for a moment that he was fainting. The low curve of thehull spun about. He knew that he fell, and that he struck something,or that something struck him. All orientation was lost. His helmetrang against metal like a great gong, and then he was sliding down acluttered slope.A blunt projection ripped across his back. Even through the leadedsuit, the pain of it made him scream. He heard the sound as a distant,throttled echo. Then even the dim green light was gone.       *       *       *       *       *The screen flickered abominably. It showed mostly a blurred mob ofpeople, trampling back and forth. Then it steadied and there was apicture, in bright, gay colors.A starfish twenty feet across wrapping itself around a woman and herstupefied child.We saw that, said Fallon. On the beach. Remember?He thought Joan answered, but there was another picture. A vast redcrab, pulling a man to bits with its claws. And after that, theshrieking woman outside the broken window, dragged down by a worm.Wonder who got those shots? said Fallon. Again Joan answered, but hedidnt hear her. The pictures moved more rapidly. Rays, black againstthe blue sky. Planes falling. Guns firing and firing and choking tosilence. People, black endless streams of them, running, running,running.Joan pulled at him. Her face was strangely huge. Her eyes were as hehad first seen them, hard chips of sapphire. And at last he heard whatshe was saying.Your fault, Webb Fallon. This might have been stopped. But you had tosleep. You couldnt take it. Youre no good, Webb. No good. No good....Her voice faded, mixed somehow with a deep throbbing noise. Joan! heshouted. Joan! But her face faded too. The last he could see was hereyes, hard and steady and deeply blue.Joan, he whispered. There was a sound in his head like the tearing ofsilk, a sensation of rushing upward. Then he was quite conscious, hisface pressed forward against his helmet and his body twisted, bruisedand painful.The first thing he saw was Einar Bjarnsson sprawled on the floorplates. A sharp point of metal had ripped his suit from neck to waist,laying his chest bare.For a moment of panic horror, Fallon sought for tears in his own suit.There were none. He relaxed with a sob of relief, and looked up at thelow curve of the hull.It was still whole. Fallon shuddered. What product of abnormalevolution had attacked them in the moment that he had looked away?Strange he hadnt seen it coming, before.The dim, still bulk of Einar Bjarnsson drew his gaze. Crouched thereon his knees, it seemed to Fallon that the whole universe drew in andcentered on that motionless body.I killed him, Fallon whispered. I looked away. I might have seen thething in time, but I looked away. I killed him.For a long time he couldnt move. Then, like the swift stroke of aknife, terror struck him.He was alone under the sea.He got up. The chronometer showed an elapsed time of nearly two hours.The course, held by an Iron Mike, was steady. The beast that hadattacked them must have lost interest.Fallon clung to a stanchion and thought, harder than he had everthought in his life.He couldnt go on by himself. There had to be two men, to gaugedistances, spot the best target, control the sub in the resultantblast. Why couldnt he forget the volcano? There were lots of islandsin the Pacific, beyond the affected sphere.He could stay drunk on palm wine as well as Scotch.Hed never see Joan again, of course. Joan, accusing, hard-eyed,contemptuous. Joan, condemning him for murder....Fallon laughed, a sharp, harsh bark. Joan, hell! That was my own mind,condemning me!       *       *       *       *       *His gaze went back to Bjarnssons body, rolling slightly with themotion of the ship. It boiled down to that. Murder. His careless,selfish murder of Bjarnsson. The murder of countless civilians. War,bitter, brutal, desperate.Fallon drew a long, shuddering breath. His head dropped forward in hishelmet, and his slanting wolfs eyes were closed. Then he turned andsat down at the controls.The single forward scope field gave him vision enough to steer.Anything might attack from the sides or the stern--another beast grownincredibly huge, but not yet a lung breather.Alone, he probably wouldnt succeed. He wouldnt live to know whetherhe had or not. His gloved hands clenched over the levers that wouldchange the course, send him away to safety.Savagely he forced his hands away. He gripped the wheel. Time slid byhim, black and silent as the water outside. And then....Something moved in the dark behind him.Slowly, slowly, Fallon rose and turned. The veins of his lean face werelike knotted cords. The hard steel of the hull held him, tight andclose, smothering.Blurred, faint movement. The soft scrape of metal against metal. He hadbeen so sure Bjarnsson was dead. Hed been dazed and sick, he hadntlooked closely. But hed been sure. Bjarnsson, lying so still, with hissuit ripped open._His suit ripped open._ Volcanic rays would be seeping into his flesh.Rays of change--perhaps they even brought the dead to life.There was a grating clang, and suddenly Fallon screamed, a short chokedsound that hurt his throat.Bjarnssons face looked at him. Bjarnssons face, with every gauntbone, every vein and muscle and convolution of the brain traced inlines of cold white fire.The shrouding leaden suit slipped from wide, stooped shoulders. Theheart beat in pulses of flame within the glowing cage of the ribs.The coil and flow of muscles in arm and thigh was a living, beautifulrhythm of light.Fallon, said Einar Bjarnsson. Turn back.The remembered voice, coming from that glowing, pulsing throat, was themost horrible thing of all.Fallon licked the cold sweat from his lips. No, he said.Turn back, or you will be killed.It doesnt matter, whispered Fallon. Ive got to try.Bjarnsson laughed. Fallon could see his diaphragm contract in a surgeof flame, see the ripple of the laughter.A wave of anger cut across Fallons terror, cold and sane.I did this to you, Bjarnsson, he said. Im trying to make up for it.I thought you were dead. Perhaps, if you put your armor back on, we canpatch it up somehow, and it may not be too late.But it is too late. So, you blame yourself, eh?I left my post. Otherwise, you might have dodged that thing.Dodged it? Tiny sparkles of light shot through Bjarnssons brain.Oh, _ja_. Perhaps. And he laughed again. So you will not turn back?Not even for the beautiful Joan?Fallons eyes closed, but the lines of his jaw were stern with anger.Do you have to torture me?Wait, said Bjarnsson. Wait a little. Then I will know.       *       *       *       *       *His voice was suddenly strange. Fallon opened his eyes. The glowingfire in the explorers body was growing brighter, so that it blurredthe lines of vein and bone and sinew.No, said Bjarnsson. No need for torture. Turn back, Fallon.God, how he wanted to! No, he whispered. Ive got to try.Bjarnssons voice came to him, almost as an echo.We were fools, Fallon. Fools to think that we could stop this thingwith a single puny bomb. Kashimo was a fool, too, but he was a gambler.But we, Fallon, you and I--we were the bigger fools.The kind of fools, said Fallon doggedly, that men have always been.And damn it, I think Id rather be the fool I am than the smart guy Iwas!Bjarnssons laughter echoed in his helmet. Fallon had a moments eeriefeeling that he heard with his brain instead of his ears.Wonderful, Fallon, wonderful! You see how circumstance makes ustraitors to ourselves? But there is no need for heroics. You can turnback, Fallon.The lines of Bjarnssons body were quite gone. He loomed against thedarkness as a pillar of shining mist. Fallons weary eyes were dazzledwith it.No, he muttered stubbornly. No.Bjarnssons voice rolled in on him suddenly, soul-shaking as an organ.Voice--or mind? A magnificent, thundering strength.This is evolution, Fallon. So shall we be, a million million yearsfrom now. This is living, Fallon. It is godhood! Take off your suit,Fallon! Grow with me!Joan, said Fallon wearily. Joan, dearest.Cosmic laughter, shuddering in his mind. And then,Turn back, Fallon. In an hour it will be too late.The shining mist was dimming, drawing in upon itself. And at the core,a tiny light was growing, a frosty white flame that seared Fallonsbrain.Turn back! Turn back!He fought, silently. But the light and the voice poured into him.Abruptly, something in him relaxed. Hed been so long without rest.He knew, very dimly, that he turned and changed the course, back towardthe coast of California.       *       *       *       *       *From somewhere, out of the gulfs between the stars, a voice spoke tohim as he lay sprawled across the control panel.There was no need for you to die, Fallon. Now, I can see much. Itwas no monster that struck us, but the first shock of a series ofquakes, which will close the fissure far better than any human agency.Therefore, what happened to me was not your fault.And I am glad it happened. I, Bjarnsson, was growing old, I hadnothing but science to hold me to Earth. Now my knowledge is boundless,and I am not confined by the fetters of the flesh. I am Mind--as someday we will all be.You will be safe, Fallon. The invasion will fail as the power is shutoff, and America can deal with any further dangers. Marry Joan, and behappy.I dont know about myself, yet. The possibilities are too vast to beexplored in a minute. I am not dead, Fallon. Remember that! But-- and,here Fallon heard an echo of Bjarnssons harsh, mocking laughter--ifyou should ever cease to be a fool and become again a smart guy, Ishall find a way to send you back along evolution, to a stupid ape!I go now, Fallon. _Skoal!_ And will you name your first-born Einar? Ican see that it will be a son!
