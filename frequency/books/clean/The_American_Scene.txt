PREFACEThe following pages duly explain themselves, I judge, as to the Authorspoint of view and his relation to his subject; but I prefix this word onthe chance of any suspected or perceived failure of such references. Myvisit to America had been the first possible to me for nearly a quarterof a century, and I had before my last previous one, brief and distantto memory, spent other years in continuous absence; so that I was toreturn with much of the freshness of eye, outward and inward, which,with the further contribution of a state of desire, is commonly held aprecious agent of perception. I felt no doubt, I confess, of my greatadvantage on that score; since if I had had time to become almost asfresh as an inquiring stranger, I had not on the other hand had enoughto cease to be, or at least to feel, as acute as an initiated native. Imade no scruple of my conviction that I should understand and shouldcare better and more than the most earnest of visitors, and yet that Ishould vibrate with more curiosityon the extent of ground, that is, onwhich I might aspire to intimate intelligence at allthan the pilgrimwith the longest list of questions, the sharpest appetite forexplanations and the largest exposure to mistakes.I felt myself then, all serenely, not exposed to grave mistakesthoughthere were also doubtless explanations which would find me, and quite ascontentedly, impenetrable. I would take my stand on my gatheredimpressions, since it was all for them, for them only, that I returned;I would in fact go to the stake for themwhich is a sign of the valuethat I both in particular and in general attach to them and that I haveendeavoured to preserve for them in this transcription. My cultivatedsense of aspects and prospects affected me absolutely as an enrichmentof my subject, and I was prepared to abide by the law of that sensetheappearance that it would react promptly in some presences only to remainimperturbably inert in others. There would be a thousand mattersmattersalready the theme of prodigious reports and statisticsas to which Ishould have no sense whatever, and as to information about which myrecord would accordingly stand naked and unashamed. It shouldunfailingly be proved against me that my opportunity had found meincapable of information, incapable alike of receiving and of impartingit; for then, and then only, would it be clearly enough attested that I_had_ cared and understood.There are features of the human scene, there are properties of thesocial air, that the newspapers, reports, surveys and blue-books wouldseem to confess themselves powerless to handle, and that yetrepresented to me a greater array of items, a heavier expression ofcharacter, than my own pair of scales would ever weigh, keep them asclear for it as I might. I became aware soon enough, on the spot, thatthese elements of the human subject, the results of these attemptedappreciations of life itself, would prove much too numerous even for acapacity all given to them for some ten months; but at least therefore,artistically concerned as I had been all my days with the human subject,with the appreciation of life itself, and with the consequent questionof literary representation, I should not find such matters scant orsimple. I was not in fact to do so, and they but led me on and on. Howfar this might have been my several chapters show; and yet even here Ifall short. I shall have to take a few others for the rest of my story.                                                                   H. J.

They referred partly, these instantvibrations, to a past recalled from very far back; fell into a train ofassociation that receded, for its beginning, to the dimness of extremeyouth. Ones extremest youth had been full of New York, and one wasabsurdly finding it again, meeting it at every turn, in sights, sounds,smells, even in the chaos of confusion and change; a process underwhich, verily, recognition became more interesting and more amusing inproportion as it became more difficult, like the spelling-out of foreignsentences of which one knows but half the words. It was not, indeed, atHoboken, on emerging from the comparatively assured order of the greatberth of the ship, that recognition _was_ difficult: there, only tooconfoundingly familiar and too serenely exempt from change, thewaterside squalor of the great city put forth again its most inimitablenotes, showed so true to the barbarisms it had not outlived that onecould only fall to wondering what obscure inward virtue had preservedit. There was virtue evident enough in the crossing of the water, thatbrave sense of the big, bright, breezy bay; of light and space andmultitudinous movement; of the serried, bristling city, held in the easyembrace of its great good-natured rivers very much as a battered andaccommodating beauty may sometimes be distinguished by a gallant lessfastidious, with his open arms, than his type would seem to imply. Butwhat was it that was still holding together, for observation, on thehither shore, the same old sordid facts, all the ugly items that hadseemed destined so long ago to fall apart from their very cynicism?therude cavities, the loose cobbles, the dislodged supports, theunreclaimed pools, of the roadway; the unregulated traffic, as ofinnumerable desperate drays charging upon each other with tragiclong-necked, sharp-ribbed horses (a length and a sharpness allemphasized by the anguish of effort); the corpulent constables, withhelmets askew, swinging their legs, in high detachment, from coigns ofcontemplation; the huddled houses of the other time, red-faced, offtheir balance, almost prone, as from too conscious an affinity withsaloon civilization.It was, doubtless, open to the repentant absentee to feel these thingssweetened by some shy principle of picturesqueness; and I admit that Iasked myself, while I considered and bumped, why what was sauce for thegoose should _not_ be in this case sauce for the gander; and whyantique shabbiness shouldnt plead on this particular waterside thecause it more or less successfully pleads on so many others. The lightof the September day was lovely, and the sun of New York rests mostly,with a laziness all its own, on that dull glaze of crimson paint, asthick as on the cheek of the cruder coquetry, which is, in general,beneath its range, the sign of the old-fashioned. Yes; I could remindmyself, as I went, that Naples, that Tangiers or Constantinople hasprobably nothing braver to flaunt, and mingle with excited recognitionthe still finer throb of seeing in advance, seeing even to alarm, manyof the responsibilities lying in wait for the habit of headlong criticalor fanciful reaction, many of the inconsistencies in which it wouldprobably have, at the best, more or less defiantly to drape itself. Suchmeditations, at all events, bridged over alike the weak places ofcriticism and some of the rougher ones of my material passage. Nothingwas left, for the rest of the episode, but a kind of fluidity ofappreciationa mild, warm wave that broke over the succession of aspectsand objects according to some odd inward rhythm, and often, no doubt,with a violence that there was little in the phenomena themselvesflagrantly to justify. It floated me, my wave, all that day and thenext; so that I still think tenderlyfor the short backward view isalready a distance with toneof the service it rendered me and of thevarious perceptive penetrations, charming coves of still blue water,that carried me up into the subject, so to speak, and enabled me to stepashore. The subject was everywherethat was the beauty, that theadvantage: it was thrilling, really, to find ones self in presence of atheme to which everything directly contributed, leaving no touch ofexperience irrelevant. That, at any rate, so far as feeling it went;treating it, evidently, was going to be a matter of prodigiousdifficulty and selectionin consequence of which, indeed, there mighteven be a certain recklessness in the largest surrender to impressions.Clearly, however, these were not for the presentand such as theywereto be kept at bay; the hour of reckoning, obviously, would come,with more of them heaped up than would prove usable, a greater quantityof vision, possibly, than might fit into decent form: whereby,assuredly, the part of wisdom was to put in as much as possible of onesrecklessness while it was fresh.It was fairly droll, for instance, the quantity of vision that began topress during a wayside rest in a house of genial but discriminatinghospitality that opened its doors just where the fiddle-string ofassociation could most intensely vibrate, just where the sense of oldNew York, of the earlier stages of the picture now so violentlyoverpainted, found most of its occasionsfound them, to extravagance,within and without. The good easy Square, known in childhood, and as ifthe light were yellower there from that small accident, bristled withreminders as vague as they were sweet; within, especially, the place wasa cool backwater, for time as well as for space; out of the slightly dimdepths of which, at the turn of staircases and from the walls ofcommunicating rooms, portraits and relics and records, faintly, quaintlysthetic, in intention at least, and discreetlyyet bravely, too, andall so archaically and patheticallyBohemian, laid traps, of apleasantly primitive order, for memory, for sentiment, for relentingirony; gross little devices, on the part of the circumscribed past,which appealed with scarce more emphasis than so many tail-pieces ofclosed chapters. The whole impression had fairly a rococo tone; and itwas in this perceptibly golden air, the air of old empty New Yorkafternoons of the waning summer-time, when the long, the perpendicularrattle, as of buckets, forever thirsty, in the bottomless well offortune, almost dies out in the merciful cross-streets, that the amplerearward loggia of the Club seemed serenely to hang; the glazed,disglazed, gallery dedicated to the array of small spread tables forwhich blank backs, right and left and opposite, made a privacy; backsblank with the bold crimson of the New York house-painter, and playingupon the chord of remembrance, all so absurdly, with the scarcely lesssimplified green of their great cascades of Virginia creeper, as yetunturned: an admonition, this, for piety, as well as a remindersinceone had somehow failed to treasure it upthat the rather pettifoggingplan of the city, the fruit, on the spot, of an artless age, happened toleave even so much margin as that for consoling chances. There wereplenty of thesewhich I perhaps seem unduly to patronize in speaking ofthem as only consolingfor many hours to come and while the easy wavethat I have mentioned continued to float me: so abysmal are theresources of the foredoomed student of manners, or so helpless, atleast, his case when once adrift in that tide.If in Gramercy Park already, three hours after his arrival, he had felthimself, this victim, up to his neck in what I have called hissubject, the matter was quite beyond calculation by the time he hadtumbled, in such a glorified four-wheeler, and with such an oddconsciousness of roughness superimposed upon smoothness, far down-townagain, and, on the deck of a shining steamer bound for the Jersey shore,was taking all the breeze of the Bay. The note of manners, the note thatbegins to sound, everywhere, for the spirit newly disembarked, with thefirst word exchanged, seemed, on the great clean deck, fairly tovociferate in the breezeand not at all, so far, as was pleasant toremark, to the harshening of that element. Nothing could have been moreto the spectators purpose, moreover, than the fact he was ready to hailas the most characteristic in the world, the fact that what surroundedhim was a rare collection of young men of business returning, as thephrase is, and in the pride of their youth and their might, to theirhomes, and that, if treasures of type were not here to bedisengaged, the fault would be all his own. It was perhaps this simplesense of treasure to be gathered in, it was doubtless this veryconfidence in the objective reality of impressions, so that they coulddeliciously be left to ripen, like golden apples, on the treeit was allthis that gave a charm to ones sitting in the orchard, gave a strangeand inordinate charm both to the prospect of the Jersey shore and toevery inch of the entertainment, so divinely inexpensive, by the way.The immense liberality of the Bay, the noble amplitude of the boat, thegreat unlocked and tumbled-out city on one hand, and the low, accessiblemystery of the opposite State on the other, watching any approach, toall appearance, with so gentle and patient an eye; the gaiety of thelight, the gladness of the air, and, above all (for it most came back tothat), the unconscious affluence, the variety in identity, of the youngmen of business: these things somehow left speculation, left curiosityexciting, yet kept it beguilingly safe. And what shall I say more of allthat presently followed than that it sharpened to the lastpleasantnessquite draining it of fears of fatuitythat consciousness ofstrolling in the orchard that was all ones own to pluck, and counting,overhead, the apples of gold? I figure, I repeat, under this name thosethick-growing items of the characteristic that were surely going to dropinto ones hand, for vivid illustration, as soon as one could begin tohold it out.Heavy with fruit, in particular, was the whole spreading bough thatrustled above me during an afternoon, a very wonderful afternoon, that Ispent in being ever so wisely driven, driven further and further, intothe large lucidity ofwell, of what else shall I call it but a NewJersey condition? That, no doubt, is a loose label for the picture; butimpressions had to range themselves, for the hour, as they could. I hadcome forth for a view of such parts of the condition as might peep outat the hour and on the spot, and it was clearly not going to be therestless analysts own fault if conditions in general, everywhere,should strike him as peculiarly, as almost affectingly, at the mercy ofobservation. They came out to meet us, in their actuality, in the softafternoon; they stood, artless, unconscious, unshamed, at the very gatesof Appearance; they might, verily, have been there, in their plenitude,at the call of some procession of drums and bannersthe principal factsof the case being collected along our passage, to my fancy, quite as ifthey had been principal citizens. And then there was the further fact ofthe case, ones own ridiculous property and signthe romantic, if notthe pathetic, circumstance of ones having had to wait till now to readeven such meagre meanings as this into a page at which ones geographymight so easily have opened. It might have threatened, for twentyminutes, to be almost complicating, but the truth was recorded: it wasan adventure, unmistakably, to have a revelation made so convenienttobe learning at last, in the maturity of ones powers, what New Jerseymight connote. This was nearer than I had ever come to any suchexperience; and it was now as if, all my life, my curiosity had beengreater than I knew. Such, for an excited sensibility, are therefinements of personal contact. These influences then were present, asa source of glamour, at every turn of our drive, and especially present,I imagined, during that longest perspective when the road took no turn,but showed us, with a large, calm consistency, the straight blue band ofsummer sea, between the sandy shore and the reclaimed margin of whichthe chain of big villas was stretched tight, or at least kept straight,almost as for the close stringing of more or less monstrous pearls. Theassociation of the monstrous thrusts itself somehow into my retrospect,for all the decent humility of the low, quiet coast, where the shadowsof the waning afternoon could lengthen at their will and the chariots ofIsrael, on the wide and admirable road, could advance, in the glitteringeye of each array of extraordinarily exposed windows, as through anharmonious golden haze.There was gold-dust in the air, no doubtwhich would have been again anelement of glamour if it had not rather lighted the scene with too crudea confidence. It was one of the phases, full of its own marks and signs,of New York, the immense, in _villeggiatura_and, presently, with littleroom left for doubt of what particular phase it might be. The huge newhouses, up and down, looked over their smart, short lawns as with acertain familiar prominence in their profiles, which was borne out bythe accent, loud, assertive, yet benevolent withal, with which theyconfessed to their extreme expensiveness. Oh, yes; we were awfullydear, for what we are and for what we doit was proud, but it wasrather rueful; with the odd appearance everywhere as of florid creationswaiting, a little bewilderingly, for their justification, waiting forthe next clause in the sequence, waiting in short for life, for time,for interest, for character, for identity itself to come to them, quiteas large spread tables or superfluous shops may wait for guests andcustomers. The scene overflowed with curious suggestion; it comes backto me with the afternoon air and the amiable flatness, the note of thesea in a drowsy mood; and I thus somehow think of the great white boxesas standing there with the silvered ghostliness (for all the silverinvolved) of a series of candid new moons. It could only be theoccupants, moreover, who were driving on the vast, featureless highway,to and fro in front of their ingenuous palaces and as if pretending notto recognize them when they passed; German Jewrywasnt itconceivable?tending to the stout, the simple, the kind, quite visiblyto the patriarchal, and with the old superseded shabbiness of LongBranch partly for the goal of their course; the big brown woodenbarracks of the hotels, the bold rotunda of the gaming-roommonumentsalready these, in truth, of a more artless age, and yet with too littlehistory about them for dignity of ruin. Dignity, if not of ruin at leastof reverence, was what, at other points, doubtless, we failedconsiderably less to read into the cottage where Grant lived and thecottage where Garfield died; though they had, for all the world, thosemodest structures, exactly the effect of objects diminished by recessioninto spaceas if to symbolize the rapidity of their recession into time.They have been left so far behind by the expensive, as the expensive isnow practised; in spite of having apparently been originally asufficient expression of it.This could pass, it seemed, for the greatest vividness of thepicturethat the expensive, for New York in _villeggiatura_, even onsuch subordinate showing, is like a train covering ground at maximumspeed and pushing on, at present, into regions unmeasurable. Itincluded, however, other lights, some of which glimmered, to my eyes, aswith the promise of great future intensityhanging themselves asdirectly over the question of manners as if they had been a row oflustres reflected in the polished floor of a ball-room. Here was theexpensive as a power by itself, a power unguided, undirected,practically unapplied, really exerting itself in a void that could makeit no response, that had nothingpoor gentle, patient, rueful, butaltogether helpless, void!to offer in return. The game was that of itsdoing, each party to the whole combination, what it could, but with theresult of the common efforts falling so short. Nothing could be of alivelier interestwith the question of manners always in viewthan tonote that the most as yet accomplished at such a cost was the air ofunmitigated publicity, publicity as a condition, as a doom, from whichthere could be no appeal; just as in all the topsy-turvy order, thedefeated scheme, the misplaced confidence, or whatever one may call it,there was no achieved protection, no constituted mystery of retreat, nosaving complexity, not so much as might be represented by a foot ofgarden wall or a preliminary sketch of interposing shade. The homelyprinciple under which the picture held at all together was that of thefamous freedom of the cat to look at the king; that seemed, so clearly,throughout, the only motto that would work. The ample villas, in theirfull dress, planted each on its little square of brightly-green carpet,and as with their stiff skirts pulled well down, eyed each other, atshort range, from head to foot; while the open road, the chariots, thebuggies, the motors, the pedestrianswhich last number, indeed, wasremarkably smallregarded at their ease both this reciprocity and theparties to it. It was in fact all _one_ participation, with an effectdeterrent to those ingenuities, or perhaps indeed rather to thosecommonplaces, of conjecture produced in general by the outward show ofthe fortunate life. That, precisely, appeared the answer to the questionof manners: the fact that in such conditions there couldnt _be_ anymanners to speak of; that the basis of privacy was somehow wanting forthem; and that nothing, accordingly, no image, no presumption ofconstituted relations, possibilities, amenities, in the social, thedomestic order, was inwardly projected. It was as if the projection hadbeen so completely outward that one could but find ones self almostuneasy about the mere perspective required for the common acts of thepersonal life, that minimum of vagueness as to what takes place in itfor which the complete home aspires to provide.What had it been their idea to _do_, the good peopledo, exactly, _for_their manners, their habits, their intercourse, their relations, theirpleasures, their general advantage and justification? Do, that is, inaffirming their wealth with such innocent emphasis and yet not at thesame time affirming anything else. It would have rested on thecold-blooded critic, doubtless, to explain why the crudity of wealth didstrike him with so direct a force; accompanied after all with noparaphernalia, no visible redundancies of possession, not so much as alodge at any gate, nothing but the scale of many of the houses and theircandid look of having cost as much as they knew how. Unmistakably theyall proclaimed itthey would have cost still more had the way but beenshown them; and, meanwhile, they added as with one voice, they wouldtake a fresh start as soon as ever it should be. We are onlyinstalments, symbols, stop-gaps, they practically admitted, and with noshade of embarrassment; expensive as we are, we have nothing to do withcontinuity, responsibility, transmission, and dont in the least carewhat becomes of us after we have served our present purpose. On thedetail of this impression, however, I neednt insist; the essence of it,which was all that was worth catching, was ones recognition of the oddtreachery that may practically lie in wait for isolated opulence. Thehighest luxury of all, the supremely expensive thing, is constitutedprivacyand yet it was the supremely expensive thing that the goodpeople had supposed themselves to be getting: all of which, I repeat,enriched the case, for the restless analyst, with an illustrativeimportance. For what did it offer but the sharp interest of the matcheverywhere and everlastingly played between the short-cut and the longroad?an interest never so sharp as since the short-cut has been able tofind itself so endlessly backed by money. Money in fact _is_ theshort-cutor the short-cut money; and the long road having, in theinstance before me, so little operated, operated for the effect, as wemay say, of the cumulative, the game remained all in the hands of itsadversary.The example went straight to the point, and thus was the dramapresented: what turn, on the larger, the general stage, was the gamegoing to take? The whole spectacle, with the question, opened out,diffusing positively a multitudinous murmur that was in my ears, forsome of the more subtly-romantic parts of the drive, as who should say(the sweet American vaguenesses, hailed again, the dear old nameless,promiscuous lengths of woodside and waterside), like the collectiveafternoon hum of invisible insects. Yes; it was all actually going to bedrama, and _that_ drama; than which nothing could be more to the occultpurpose of the confirmed, the systematic story-seeker, or to that evenof the mere ancient contemplative person curious of character. The very_donne_ of the piece could be given, the subject formulated: the greatadventure of a society reaching out into the apparent void for theamenities, the consummations, after having earnestly gathered in so manyof the preparations and necessities. Into the apparent voidI had toinsist on that, since without it there would be neither comedy nortragedy; besides which so little was wanting, in the way of vacancy, tothe completeness of the appearance. What would lurk beneath thisorindeed what wouldnt, what mightntto thicken the plot from stage tostage and to intensify the action? The story-seeker would be present,quite intimately present, at the general effortshowing, doubtless, asquite heroic in many a caseto gouge an interest _out_ of the vacancy,gouge it with tools of price, even as copper and gold and diamonds areextracted, by elaborate processes, from earth-sections of smallsuperficial expression. What was such an effort, on its associated side,for the attentive mind, but a more or less adventurous fight, carried onfrom scene to scene, with fluctuations and variations, the shiftingquantity of success and failure? Never would be such a chance to see howthe short-cut works, and if there be really any substitute forroundabout experience, for troublesome history, for the long, theimmitigable process of time. It was a promise, clearly, of the highestentertainment.                                   IIIt was presently to come back to me, however, that there were othersorts, tooso many sorts, in fact, for the ancient contemplative person,that selection and omission, in face of them, become almost a pain, andthe sacrifice of even the least of these immediate sequences ofimpression in its freshness a lively regret. But without muchforeshortening is no representation, and I was promptly to becomeconscious, at all events, of quite a different part of the picture, andof personal perceptions, to match it, of a different order. I woke up,by a quick transition, in the New Hampshire mountains, in the deepvalleys and the wide woodlands, on the forest-fringed slopes, thefar-seeing crests of the high places, and by the side of the liberalstreams and the lonely lakes; things full, at first, of the sweetness ofbelated recognition, that of the sense of some bedimmed summer of thedistant prime flushing back into life and asking to give again as muchas possible of what it had given beforeall in spite, too, of muchunacquaintedness, of the newness, to my eyes, through the mild Septemberglow, of the particular rich region. I call it rich without compunction,despite its several poverties, caring little that half the charm, orhalf the response to it, may have been shamelessly subjective; sincethat but slightly shifts the ground of the beauty of the impression.When you wander about in Arcadia you ask as few questions as possible.That _is_ Arcadia in fact, and questions drop, or at least getthemselves deferred and shiftlessly shirked; in conformity with whichtruth the New England hills and woodssince they were not all, for theweeks to come, of mere New Hampshirethe mild September glow and eventhe clear October blaze were things to play on the chords of memory andassociation, to say nothing of those of surprise, with an admirable artof their own. The tune may have dropped at last, but it succeeded for amonth in being strangely sweet, and in producing, quite with intensity,the fine illusion. Here, moreover, was interest of the sort that couldcome easily, and therefore not of the sortquite the contrarythatinvolved a consideration of the millions spent; a fact none the fainter,into the bargain, for having its curious, unexpected, inscrutable side.Why was the whole connotation so _delicately_ Arcadian, like that of theArcadia of an old tapestry, an old legend, an old love-story in fifteenvolumes, one of those of Mademoiselle de Scudri? Why, in default ofother elements of the higher finish, did all the woodwalks and nestlednooks and shallow, carpeted dells, why did most of the larger viewsthemselves, the outlooks to purple crag and blue horizon, insist onreferring themselves to the idyllic _type_ in its purity?as if thehigher finish, even at the hand of nature, were in some sort aperversion, and hillsides and rocky eminences and wild orchards, inshort any common sequestered spot, could strike one as the moreexquisitely and ideally Sicilian, Theocritan, poetic, romantic,academic, from their not bearing the burden of too much history. Thehistory was there in its degree, and one came upon it, on sunnyafternoons, in the form of the classic abandoned farm of the rudeforefather who had lost patience with his fate. These scenes of old,hard New England effort, defeated by the soil and the climate andreclaimed by nature and timethe crumbled, lonely chimney-stack, theovergrown threshold, the dried-up well, the cart-track vague andlostthese seemed the only notes to interfere, in their meagreness, withthe queer _other_, the larger, eloquence that one kept reading into thepicture. Even the wild legend, immediately local, of the Indian who,having, a hundred years ago, murdered a husbandman, was pursued, byroused avengers, to the topmost peak of Chocorua Mountain, and thence,to escape, took his leap into the abysseven so sharp an echo of adefinite far-off past, enriching the effect of an admirable silveredsummit (for Chocorua Mountain carries its grey head quite with thegrandest air), spent itself in the mere idleness of the undiscriminated,tangled actual. There was one thinkable reason, of course, foreverything, which hung there as a possible answer to any question,should any question insist. Did one by chance exaggerate, did onerhapsodize amiss, and was the apparent superior charm of the whole thingmainly but an accident of ones own situation, the state of havinghappened to be deprived to excessthat is for too longof naturalism in_quantity_? Here it was in such quantity as one hadnt for years had todeal with; and that might by itself be a luxury corrupting the judgment.It was absurd, perhaps, to have ones head so easily turned; but therewas perfect convenience, at least, in the way the parts of theimpression fell together and took a particular light. This light, fromwhatever source proceeding, cast an irresistible spell, bathed thepicture in the confessed resignation of early autumn, the charmingsadness that resigned itself with a silent smile. I say silent becausethe voice of the air had dropped as forever, dropped to a stillnessexquisite, day by day, for a pilgrim from a land of stertorousbreathing, one of the windiest corners of the world; the leaves of theforest turned, one by one, to crimson and to gold, but never broke off:all to the enhancement of this strange conscious hush of the landscape,which kept one in presence as of a world created, a stage set, a sort ofample capacity constituted, forwell, for things that wouldnt, afterall, happen: more the pity for them, and for me and for you. This viewof so many of the high places of the hills and deep places of the woods,the lost trails and wasted bowers, the vague, empty, rock-roughenedpastures, the lonely intervals where the afternoon lingered and thehidden ponds over which the season itself seemed to bend as a youngbedizened, a slightly melodramatic mother, before taking some guiltyflight, hangs over the crib of her sleeping childthese things put you,so far as you were preoccupied with the human history of places, into amood in which appreciation became a positive wantonness and the sense ofquality, plucking up unexpectedly a spirit, fairly threatened to takethe game into its hands. You discovered, when once it was stirred, anelegance in the commonest objects, and a mystery even in accidents thatreally represented, perhaps, mere plainness unashamed. Why otherwise,for instance, the inveterate charm of the silver-grey rock croppingthrough thinly-grassed acres with a placed and composed felicity thatsuggested the furniture of a drawing-room? The great boulders in thewoods, the pulpit-stones, the couchant and rampant beasts, the isolatedcliffs and lichened cathedrals, had all, seen, as one passed, throughtheir drizzle of forest light, a special New Hampshire beauty; but Inever tired of finding myself of a sudden in some lonely confined place,that was yet at the same time both wide and bright, where I couldrecognize, after the fashion of the old New Hampshire sociability, everyfacility for spending the day. There was the odditythe place wasfurnished by its own good taste; its bosky ring shut it in, the two orthree gaps of the old forgotten enclosure made symmetrical doors, thesweet old stones had the surface of grey velvet, and the scattered wildapples were like figures in the carpet.It might be an ado about triflesand half the poetry, roundabout, thepoetry in solution in the air, was doubtless but the alertness of thetouch of autumn, the imprisoned painter, the Bohemian with a rustyjacket, who had already broken out with palette and brush; yet the waythe colour begins in those days to be dabbed, the way, here and there,for a start, a solitary maple on a woodside flames in single scarlet,recalls nothing so much as the daughter of a noble house dressed for afancy-ball, with the whole family gathered round to admire her beforeshe goes. One speaks, at the same time, of the orchards; but there areproperly no orchards where half the countryside shows, all September,the easiest, most familiar sacrifice to Pomona. The apple-tree, in NewEngland, plays the part of the olive in Italy, charges itself with theeffect of detail, for the most part otherwise too scantly produced, and,engaged in this charming care, becomes infinitely decorative anddelicate. What it must do for the too under-dressed land in May and Juneis easily supposable; but its office in the early autumn is to scattercoral and gold. The apples are everywhere and every interval, every oldclearing, an orchard; they have run down from neglect and shrunkenfrom cheapnessyou pick them up from under your feet but to bite intothem, for fellowship, and throw them away; but as you catch their youngbrightness in the blue air, where they suggest strings ofstrange-coloured pearls tangled in the knotted boughs, as you note theirmanner of swarming for a brief and wasted gaiety, they seem to ask to bepraised only by the cheerful shepherd and the oaten pipe. The questionof the encircled waters too, larger and smallerthat again was perhapsan ado about trifles; but you cant, in such conditions, and especiallyat first, resist the appeal of their extraordinarily mild faces andwooded brims, with the various choice spots where the great straightpines, interspaced beside them, and yielding to small strands as finelycurved as the eyebrows of beauty, make the sacred grove and the Americanclassic temple, the temple for the worship of the evening sky, the cultof the Indian canoe, of Fenimore Cooper, of W. C. Bryant, of theimmortalizable water-fowl. They look too much alike, the lakes and theponds, and this is, indeed, all over the world, too much a reproach tolakes and pondsto all save the pick of the family, say, like George andChamplain; the American idea, moreover, is too inveterately that woodsshall grow thick to the water. Yet there is no feature of grace thelandscape could so ill sparelet alone ones not knowing what other,what baser, promiscuity mightnt oppress the banks if that of the freeovergrowth didnt. Each surface of this sort is a breathing-space in thelarge monotony; the rich recurrence of water gives a polish to themanner itself, so to speak, of nature; thanks to which, in any case, thememory of a characteristic perfection attaches, I find, to certain hoursof declining day spent, in a shallow cove, on a fallen log, by thescarce-heard plash of the largest liquid expanse under Chocorua; asituation interfused with every properest item of sunset and eveningstar, of darkening circle of forest, of boat that, across the water, putnoiselessly outof analogy, in short, with every typical triumph of theAmerican landscape school, now as rococo as so many squares ofingenious wool-work, but the remembered delight of our childhood. On_terra firma_, in New England, too often dusty or scrubby, the guaranteeis small that some object at variance, cruelly at variance, with theglamour of the landscape school may not put out. But that boat acrossthe water is safe, is sustaining as far as it goes; it puts out from thecove of romance, from the inlet of poetry, and glides straight over,with muffled oar, to thewell, to the right place.The consciousness of quantity, rather, as opposed to quality, to which Ijust alluded, quantity inordinate, quantity duly impressive and duly, ifneed be, overwhelming, had been the form of vigilance posting itself atthe windowwhence, incontestably, after a little, yielding to the somarked agitation of its sister-sense, it stepped back into the shadow ofthe room. If memory, at any rate, with its message so far to carry, hadplayed one a trick, imagination, or some finer faculty still, could playanother to match it. If it had settled to a convenience of the mind thatNew England scenery was hard and dry and thin, scrubby and meagre andplain, here was that comfort routed by every plea of fancythough of afancy indeed perhaps open to the charge of the morbidand by everyrefinement of appeal. The oddest thing in the world would delightfullyhave happenedand happened just therein case one had really found theright word for the anomaly of ones surprise. What would the right wordbe but that nature, in these lights, was no single one of the horridthings I have named, but was, instead of them all, that quite otherhappy and charming thing, _feminine_?feminine from head to foot, inexpression, tone and touch, mistress throughout of the feminine attitudeand effect. That had by no means the figure recalled from far back, butwhen once it had fully glimmered out it fitted to perfection, it becamethe case like a crown of flowers and provided completely for onesrelation to the subject.Oh Italy, thou woman-land! breaks out Browning, more than once,straight at _that_ mark, and with a force of example that, for thisother collocation, served much more as an incitement than as a warning.Reminded vividly of the identities of latitude and living so much in thesame relation to the sun, you never really in New Hampshirenor inMassachusetts, I was soon able to observelook out at certain hours forthe violet spur of an Apennine or venture to speak, in your admiration,of Tuscan or Umbrian forms, without feeling that the ground has quitegratefully borne you. The matter, however, the matter of the insidiousgrace, is not at all only a question of amusing coincidence; somethingintrinsically lovable everywhere lurkswhich most comes out indeed, nodoubt, under the consummate art of autumn. How shall one lightly enoughexpress it, how describe it or to what compare it?since, unmistakably,after all, the numbered items, the few flagrant facts, fail perfectly toaccount for it. It is like some diffused, some slightly confounding,sweetness of voice, charm of tone and accent, on the part of someenormous family of rugged, of almost ragged, rusticsa tribe of sons anddaughters too numerous to be counted and homogeneous perhaps tomonotony. There was a voice in the air, from week to week, a spiritualvoice: Oh, the _lands_ all right!it took on fairly a fondness ofemphasis, it rebounded from other aspects, at times, with such atenderness. Thus it sounded, the blessed note, under many promptings,but always in the same form and to the effect that the poor dear landitselfif that was all that was the matterwould beautifully do. Itseemed to plead, the pathetic presence, to be liked, to be loved, to bestayed with, lived with, handled with some kindness, shown even somecourtesy of admiration. What was that but the feminine attitude?not theactual, current, impeachable, but the old ideal and classic; the air ofmeeting you everywhere, standing in wait everywhere, yet always withoutconscious defiance, only in mild submission to your doing what you wouldwith it. The mildness was of the very essence, the essence of all theforms and lines, all the postures and surfaces, all the slimness andthinness and elegance, all the consent, on the part of trees and rocksand streams, even of vague happy valleys and fine undistinguished hills,to be viewed, to their humiliation, in the mass, instead of being viewedin the piece.It is perhaps absurd to have to hasten to add that doing what you wouldwith it, in these irresponsible senses, simply left out of account, forthe country in general, the proved, the notorious fact that nothinguseful, nothing profitable, nothing directly economic, _could_ be doneat all. Written over the great New Hampshire region at least, andstamped, in particular, in the shadow of the admirable high-perched coneof Chocorua, which rears itself, all granite, over a huge interposingshoulder, quite with the _allure_ of a minor Matterhorneverywherelegible was the hard little historic record of agricultural failure anddefeat. It had to pass for the historic background, that traceable truththat a stout human experiment had been tried, had broken down. One wasin presence, everywhere, of the refusal to consent to history, and ofthe consciousness, on the part of every site, that this preciouscompound is in no small degree being insolently made, on the other sideof the continent, at the expense of such sites. The touching appeal ofnature, as I have called it therefore, the Do something kind for me,is not so much a Live upon me and thrive by me as a Live _with_ me,somehow, and let us make out together what we may do for eachothersomething that is not merely estimable in more or less greasygreenbacks. See how sympathetic I am, the still voice seemedeverywhere to proceed, and how I am therefore better than my fate; seehow I lend myself to poetry and sociabilitypositively to sthetic use:give me that consolation. The appeal was thus not only from the rudeabsence of the company that had gone, and the still ruder presence ofthe company left, the scattered families, of poor spirit and loosehabits, who had feared the risk of change; it was to a listening ear,directlythat of the summer people, to whom, in general, one soonbegan to figure so much of the country, in New England, as looking forits future; with the consequence in fact that, from place to place, thesummer people themselves almost promised to glow with a reflected light.It was a clue, at any rate, in the maze of contemplation, for thisvision of the relation so established, the disinherited, theimpracticable land throwing itself, as for a finer argument, on thenon-rural, the intensely urban class, and the class in question throwingitself upon the land for reasons of its own. What would come of such an_entente_, on the great scale, for both parties?that special wondermentwas to strike me everywhere as in order. How populations with money tospare may extract a vulgar joy from show sections of the earth, likeSwitzerland and Scotland, we have seen abundantly proved, so that thisparticular lesson has little more to teach us; in America, however,evidently, the difference in the conditions, and above all in the scaleof demonstration, is apt to make lessons new and larger.Once the whole question had ranged itself under that headwhat would thesummer people, as a highly comprehensive term, do with the aspects(perhaps as a highly comprehensive term also), and what would theaspects do with the summer people?it became conveniently portable andrecurrently interesting. Perhaps one of the best reasons I can give forthis last side of it was that it kept again and again presenting theidea of that responsibility for _appearances_ which, in such anassociation as loomed thus large, was certain to have to fix itselfsomewhere. What was one to say of appearances as they actuallyprevailedfrom the moment, I mean, they were not of the charming orderthat nature herself could care for? The appearances of man, theappearances of woman, and of their conjoined life, the general latentspectacle of their arrangements, appurtenances, manners, devices, openedup a different chapter, the leaves of which one could but musingly turn.A better expression of the effect of most of this imagery on the mindshould really be sought, I think, in its seeming, through its sadconsistency, a mere complete negation of appearancesusing the term inthe sense of any familiar and customary care for looks. Even therecognition that, the scattered summer people apart, the thin populationwas poor and bare had its bewilderment, on which I shall presentlytouch; but the poverty and the bareness were, as we seemed to measurethem, a straight admonition of all we had, from far back, so easily andcomfortably taken for granted, in the rural picture, on the other sideof the world. There was a particular thing that, more than any other,had been pulled out of the view and that left the whole show, humanlyand socially, a collapse. This particular thing was exactly the fact ofthe _importance_, the significance, imputable, in a degree, toappearances. In the region in which these observations first languishedinto life that importance simply didnt exist at all, and its absencewas everywhere forlornly, almost tragically, attested. There was thelittle white wooden village, of course, with its houses in queeralignment and its rudely-emphasized meeting-house, in particular, verynearly as unconsecrated as the store or the town pump; but thisrepresented, throughout, the highest tribute to the amenities. A sordidugliness and shabbiness hung, inveterately, about the wayside farms,and all their appurtenances and incidentsabove all, about theirinmates; when the idea of appearance was anywhere expressed (and itshighest flights were but in the matter of fresh paint or a sweptdooryard), a summer person was usually the author of the boon. Theteams, the carts, the conveyances in their kinds, the sallow, saturninenatives in charge of them, the enclosures, the fences, the gates, thewayside bits, of whatever sort, so far as these were referable tohuman attention or human neglect, kept telling the tale of thedifference made, in a land of long winters, by the suppression of thetwo great factors of the familiar English landscape, the squire and theparson.What the squire and the parson do, between them, for appearances (whichis what I am talking of) in scenes, predominantly Anglo-Saxon, subjectto their sway, is brought home, as in an ineffable glow, when theelements are reduced to composing, in the still larger Anglo-Saxonlight, without them. Here was no church, to begin with; and the shrilleffect of the New England meeting-house, in general, so merelycontinuous and congruous, as to type and tone, with the common objectsabout it, the single straight breath with which it seems to blow theground clear of the seated solidity of religion, is an impression thatresponds to the renewed sight of one of these structures as promptly asthe sharp ring to the pressure of the electric button. One lives amongEnglish ancientries, for instance, as in a world toward the furnishingof which religion has done a large part. And here, immediately, was aroom vast and vacant, with a vacancy especially reducible, for most ofthe senses, to the fact of that elimination. Perpetually, inevitably,moreover, as the restless analyst wandered, the eliminated thing _parexcellence_ was the thing most absent to sightand for which, oh! athousand times, the small substitutes, the mere multiplication of thesigns of theological enterprise, in the tradition and on the scale ofcommercial and industrial enterprise, had no attenuation worthmentioning. The case, in the New Hampshire hills at least, was quite thesame for the pervasive Patron, whose absence made such a hole. We wenton counting up all the blessings we had, too unthankfully, elsewhereowed to him; we lost ourselves in the intensity of the truth that tocompare a simplified social order with a social order in which feudalismhad once struck deep was the right way to measure the penetration offeudalism. If there was no point here at which they had perceptiblybegun, there was on the other side of the world no point at which theyhad perceptibly ceased. Ones philosophy, ones logic might perhaps bemuddled, but one clung to them for the convenience of their explanationof so much of the ugliness. The uglinessone pounced, indeed, on this ason a talisman for the futurewas the so complete abolition of _forms_;if, with so little reference to their past, present or futurepossibility, they could be said to have been even so much honoured as tobe abolished.The pounce at any rate was, for a guiding light, effectual; the guidinglight worked to the degree of seeming at times positively to save therestless analyst from madness. He could make the absence of formsresponsible, and he could thus react without bitternessreact absolutelywith pity; he could judge without cruelty and condemn without despair;he could think of the case as perfectly definite and say to himselfthat, could forms only _be_, as a recognized accessory to manners,introduced and developed, the ugliness might begin scarcely to knowitself. He could play with the fancy that the people might at last growfairly to like themfar better, at any rate, than the class in questionmay in its actual ignorance suppose: the necessity would be to give it,on an adequate scale and in some lucid way, a taste of the revelation.What form, meanwhile, _could_ there be in the almost sophisticateddinginess of the present destitution? One thoughtfully asked that,though at the cost of being occasionally pulled up by odd glimpses ofthe underlying existence of a standard. There was the wage-standard, tobegin with; the well-nigh awestruck view of the high rate ofremuneration open to the most abysmally formless of hired men, indeedto field or house labour, expert or inexpert, on the part of either sex,in any connection: the ascertainment of which was one of thebewilderments I just now spoke of, one of the failures of consistencyin the grey revelation. After this there was the standard, ah! the veryhigh standard, of sensibility and propriety, so far as tribute on thisground was not owed by the parties themselves, but owed _to_ them, notto be rendered, but to be received, and with a stiff, a warningly stiff,account kept of it. Didnt it appear at moments a theme for endlessstudy, this queer range of the finer irritability in the breasts ofthose whose fastidiousness was compatible with the violation of almostevery grace in life _but_ that one? Are you the woman of the house? arustic cynically squalid, and who makes it a condition of _any_intercourse that he be received at the front door of the house, not atthe back, asks of a _matresse de maison_, a summer person trained toresignation, as preliminary to a message brought, as he then mentions,from the washerlady. These are the phenomena, of course, that promptthe woman of the house, and perhaps still more the man, to throwherself, as I say, on the land, for what it may give her of balm andbeautya character to which, as I also say, the land may affect theseunfortunates as so consciously and tenderly playing up. The lesson hadperhaps to be taught; if the Patron is at every point so out of thepicture, the end is none the less not yet of the demonstration, on thepart of the figures peopling it, that they are not to be patronized.Once to see this, however, was again to focus the possible evolution ofmanners, the latent drama to come: the sthetic enrichment of the summerpeople, so far as they should be capable or worthy of it, by contactwith the consoling background, so full of charming secrets, and theforces thus conjoined for the production and the imposition of forms.Thrown back again almost altogether, as by the Jersey shore, on theexcitement of the speculative, one could extend unlimitedlyby which Imean one could apply to a thousand phases of the waiting spectacletheidea of the possible drama. So everything worked round, afresh, to thepromise of the large interest.                                  IIIIf the interest then was large, this particular interest of the socialside of the general scene, more and more likely to emerge, what betterproof could I want again than the differences of angle at which itcontinued to present itself? The differences of angleas obvious mostimmediately, for instance, north of the mountains, and first of all inthe valley of the Sacogathered into their train a hundred happyvariations. I kept tight hold of my temporary clue, the plea of thecountrys amiability, as I have called it, its insinuating appeal fromtoo rigorous a doom; but there was a certain strain in this, from day today, and relief was apparent as soon as the conditions changed. Theychanged, notably, by the rapid and complete drop of the sordid elementfrom the picture; it was, for all the world, of a sudden, as ifAppearance, precious principle, had again asserted its rights. Thatconfidence, clearly, at North Conway, had come to it in the course ofthe long years, too many to reckon over, that separated my late from myearly visionthough I recognized as disconcerting, toward the close ofthe autumn day, to have to owe this perception, in part, to the greatstraddling, bellowing railway, the high, heavy, dominant American trainthat so reverses the relation of the parties concerned, suggestingsomehow that the country exists for the cars, which overhang it like aconquering army, and not the cars for the country. This presence hadlearned to penetrate the high valleys and had altered, unmistakably, theold felicity of proportion. The old informal earthy coach-road was afirm highway, wide and whiteand ground to dust, for all its firmness,by the whirling motor; without which I might have followed it, back andback a little, into the near, into the far, country of youthleft lying,however, as the case stood, beyond the crest of a hill. Only the highrock-walls of the Ledges, the striking sign of the spot, were there;grey and perpendicular, with their lodged patches of shrub-like forestgrowth, and the immense floor, below them, where the Saco spreads andturns and the elms of the great general meadow stand about likecandelabra (with their arms reversed) interspaced on a green table.There hung over these things the insistent hush of a September Sundaymorning; nowhere greater than in the tended woods enclosing theadmirable country home that I was able to enjoy as a centre forcontemplation; woods with their dignity maintained by a large and artfulclearance of undergrowth, and repaying this attention, as always, bysomething of the semblance of a sacred grove, a place prepared for highuses, even if for none rarer than high talk. There was a latentpoetryold echoes, ever so faint, that _would_ come back; it made ageneral meaning, lighted the way to the great modern farm, all socontemporary and exemplary, so replete with beauty of beasts andconvenience of man, with a positive dilettantism of care, but making oneperhaps regret a little the big, dusky, heterogeneous barns, the moreBohemian bucolics, of the earlier time. I went down into the valleythatwas an impression to woo by stages; I walked beside one of those greatfields of standing Indian corn which make, to the eye, so perfect a notefor the rest of the American rural picture, throwing the conditions backas far as our past permits, rather than forward, as so many other thingsdo, into the age to come. The maker of these reflections betook himselfat last, in any case, to an expanse of rock by a large bend of the Saco,and lingered there under the infinite charm of the place. The rich, fulllapse of the river, the perfect brownness, clear and deep, as of liquidagate, in its wide swirl, the large indifferent ease in its pace andmotion, as of some great benevolent institution smoothly working; allthis, with the sense of the deepening autumn about, gave I scarce knowwhat pastoral nobleness to the scene, something raising it out of thereach of even the most restless of analysts. The analyst in fact couldscarce be restless here; the impression, so strong and so final,persuaded him perfectly to peace. This, on September Sunday mornings,was what American beauty _should_ be; it filled to the brim its idea andits measurealbeit Mount Washington, hazily overhung, happened not tocontribute to the effect. It was the great, gay river, singing as itwent, like some reckless adventurer, goodhumoured for the hour and withhis hands in his pockets, that argued the whole case and carriedeverything assentingly before it.Who, for that matter, shall speak, who shall begin to speak, of thealacrity with which, in the New England scene (to confine ourselves forthe moment only to that), the eye and the fancy take to the water?taketo it often for relief and security, the corrective it supplies to thedanger of the common. The case is rare when it is not better than theother elements of the picture, even if these be at their best; and itsstrength is in the fact that the common has, for the most part, to stopshort at its brink; no water being intrinsically less distinguishedsavewhen it is dirtythan any other. By a fortunate circumstance, moreover,are not the objects usually afloat on American lakes and rivers, to saynothing of bays and sounds, almost always white and wonderful,high-piled, characteristic, fantastic things, begotten of the nativeconditions and shining in the native light? Let my question, however,not embroider too extravagantly my mere sense of driving presently,though after nightfall, and in the public conveyance, into a villagethat gave out, through the dusk, something of the sense of a flourishingSwiss village of the tourist season, as one recalls old Alpineassociations: the swing of the coach, the cold, high air, the scatteredhotels and their lighted windows, the loitering people who might becelebrated climbers or celebrated guides, the resonance of the bridge asone crossed, the gleam of the swift river under the lamps. My villagehad no happy name; it was, crudely speaking, but Jackson, N. H., just asthe swift river that, later on, in the morning light, to the immediatevision, easily surpassed everything else, was only the river of theWildcata superiority strictly comparative. The note of this superioritywas in any case already there, for the first, for the nocturnalimpression; scarce seen, only heard as yet, it could still give thegloom a larger lift than any derived from a tour of the piazzas of thehotels. This tour, undertaken while supper was preparing, in theinterest of a study of manners, left room, all the same, for muchsupport to the conviction I just expressed, the conviction that, namefor name, the stream had got off better than the village, that streams_couldnt_, at the worst, have such cruel names as villages, and thatthis too, after all, was an intimation of their relative value. Thatinference was, for the actual case, to be highly confirmed; the WildcatRiver, on the autumn morning, in its deep valley and its precipitousbed, was as headlong and romantic as one could desire; though, indeed, Iam not, in frankness, prepared to say better things of it than of thegreat picture, the feature of the place, to a view of which I mounted anhour or two after breakfast.Here, at least, where a small and charming country-house had seateditself very much as the best box, on the most expensive tier, rakes theprospect for grand operahere might manners too be happily studied, saveperhaps for their being enjoyed at too short range. Here, verily, wereverandahs of contemplation, but admitting to such images of furnishedpeace, within, as could but illustrate a rare personal history. This wasa felicity apart; whereas down in the valley, the night before, thestory told at the lighted windows of the inns was precisely, was aboveall, of advantages impartially diffused and shared. That, at any rate,would seem in each instance the most direct message of the lifedisplayed to the observer, on the fresher evenings, in the halls andparlours, the large, clean, bare spaces (almost penally clean and bare),where plain, respectable families seemed to sit and study in silence,with a kind of awe indeed, as from a sense of inevitable doom, theirreflected resemblances, from group to group, their baffling identitiesof type and tone, their inability to escape from participations andcommunities. My figure of the opera-box, for the other, the removed,case, is justified meanwhile by the memory of the happy vision that wasto make up to me for having missed Mount Washington at Intervale; thesomething splendidly scenic in the composition of the Presidentialrange, hung in the air, across the valley, with its most eminent objectholding exactly the middle of the stage and the grand effect stretchingwithout a break to either wing. Mount Washington, seen from such a pointof vantage, a kind of noble equality of intercourse, looks admirably,solidly _seated_, as with the other Presidential peaks standing at hischair; and the picture is especially sublime far off to the right, withthe grand style of Carters Dome, a masterly piece of drawing againstthe sky, and the romantic dip of Carters Notch, the very ideal of thepass (other than Alpine) that announces itself to the winding wayfarer,for beauty and interest, from a distance. The names, Presidential andother, minister little to the poetry of association; but that,throughout the American scene, is a source of irritation with which therestless analyst has had, from far back, to count. Charming places,charming objects, languish, all round him, under designations that seemto leave on them the smudge of a great vulgar thumbwhich is precisely apart of what the pleading land appears to hint to you when it murmurs,in autumn, its intelligent refrain. If it feels itself better than somany of the phases of its fate, so there are spots where you see it turnup at you, under some familiar tasteless infliction of this order, theplaintive eye of a creature wounded with a poisoned arrow.You learn, after a little, not to insist on namesthat is not to inquireof them; and are happiest perchance when the answer is made you as itwas made me by a neighbour, in a railway train, on the occasion of mygreatly admiring, right and left of us, a tortuous brawling river. I hadsupposed it for a moment, in my innocence, the Connecticutwhich itdecidedly was not; it was only, as appeared, a stream _quelconque_, astream without an identity. That was better, somehow, than the adventureof a little latermy learning, too definitely, that another stream,ample, admirable, in every way distinguished, a stream worthy ofRuysdael or Salvator Rosa, was known but as the Farmington River. This Icould in no manner put up withthis taking by the greater of thecomparatively common little names of the less. Farmington, as I waspresently to learn, is a delightful, a model village; but villages,fords, bridges are not the godparents of the element that makes thempossible, they are much rather the godchildren. So far as suchreflections might be idle, however, in an order so differentlydetermined, they easily lost themselves, on the morrow of Jackson, N.H., in an impression of sharper intensity; that of a drive away, on thetop of the coach, in the wondrous, lustrous early morning and in companythat positively gave what it had to give quite as if it had had mycuriosity on its conscience. That curiosity held its breath, in truth,for fear of breaking the spellthe spell of the large liberty with whicha pair of summer girls and a summer youth, from the hotel, took allnature and all society (so far as society was present on the top of thecoach) into the confidence of their personal relation. Their personalrelationthat of the young man was with the two summer girls, whose ownwas all with _him_; any other, with their mother, for instance, who satspeechless and serene beside me, with the other passengers, with thecoachman, the guard, the quick-eared four-in-hand, being for the timecompletely suspended. The freedoms of the young threewho were, by theway, not in their earliest bloom eitherwere thus bandied in the void ofthe gorgeous valley without even a consciousness of its shriller, itsrecording echoes. The whole phenomenon was documentary; it started, forthe restless analyst, innumerable questions, amid which he felt himselfsink beyond his depth. The immodesty was too colossal to be anything butinnocenceyet the innocence, on the other hand, was too colossal to beanything but inane. And they were alive, the slightly stale three: theytalked, they laughed, they sang, they shrieked, they romped, they scaledthe pinnacle of publicity and perched on it flapping their wings;whereby they were shown in possession of many of the movements of life.Life, however, involved in some degree experienceif only theexperience, for instance, of the summer apparently just spent, at agreat cost, in the gorgeous valley. How was _that_, how was theperception of any concurrent presence, how was the human or socialfunction at all, compatible with the _degree_ of the inanity? There was,as against this, the possibility that the inanity was feigned, if notthe immodesty; and the fact that there would have been more immodesty infeigning it than in letting it flow clear. These were maddeningmystifications, and the puzzle fortunately dropped with the arrival ofthe coach at the station.                                   IVClearly, none the less, there were puzzles and puzzles, and I had almostimmediately the amusement of waking up to anotherthis one of adifferent order altogether. The point was that if the bewilderments Ihave just mentioned had dropped, most other things had dropped too: thechallenge to curiosity here was in the extreme simplification of thepicture, a simplification on original lines. Not that there was notstill much to think ofif only because one had to stare at the verywonder of a picture so simplified. The thing now was to catch this note,to keep it in the ear and see, really, how far and how long it wouldsound. The simplification, for that immediate vision, was to a broadband of deep and clear blue sea, a blue of the deepest and clearestconceivable, limited in one quarter by its far and sharp horizon of sky,and in the other by its near and sharp horizon of yellow sandover-fringed with a low woody shore; the whole seen through thecontorted cross-pieces of stunted, wind-twisted, far-spreading, quitefantastic old pines and cedars, whose bunched bristles, at the ends oflong limbs, produced, against the light, the most vivid of allreminders. Cape Cod, on this showing, was exactly a pendent, picturedJapanese screen or banner; a delightful little triumph ofimpressionism, which, during my short visit at least, never departed,under any provocation, from its type. Its type, so easily formulated, socompletely filled, was there the last thing at night and the first thingin the morning; there was rest for the mindfor that, certainly, of therestless analystin having it so exactly under ones hand. After thatone could read into it other meanings without straining or disturbingit. There was a couchant promontory in particular, half bosky with theevergreen boskage of the elegant kakemono, half bare with the barenessof refined, the _most_ refined, New England decorationa low, hospitableheadland projected, as by some water-colourist master of the trick, intoa mere brave wash of cobalt. It interfered, the sweet promontory, withits generous Boston bungalow, its verandahs still haunted with oldsummer-times, and so wide that the present could elbow and yet notjostle the pastit interfered no whit, for all its purity of style, withthe human, the social question always dogging the steps of the ancientcontemplative person and making him, before each scene, wish really toget _into_ the picture, to cross, as it were, the threshold of theframe. It never lifts, verily, this obsession of the story-seeker,however often it may flutter its wings, it may bruise its breast,against surfaces either too hard or too blank. The _manners_, themanners: where and what are they, and what have they to tell?thathaunting curiosity, essential to the honour of his office, yet making itmuch of a burden, fairly buzzes about his head the more pressingly inproportion as the social mystery, the lurking human secret, seems moreshy.Then it is that, as he says to himself, the secret must be mostqueerand it might therefore well have had, so insidiously sounded, asupreme queerness on Cape Cod. For not the faintest echo of it trembledout of the blankness; there were always the little white houses of thevillage, there were always the elegant elms, feebler and more featheryhere than further inland; but the life of the little community waspractically locked up as tight as if it had _all_ been a question ofpainted Japanese silk. And that was doubtless, for the story-seeker,absolutely the little story: the constituted blankness was the wholebusiness, and ones opportunity was all, thereby, for a study ofexquisite emptiness. This was stuff, in its own way, of a beautifulquality; that impression came to me with a special sweetness that I havenot forgotten. The help in the matter was that I had not forgotten,either, a small pilgrimage or two of far-away earlier yearsthe sense asof absent things in other summer-times, golden afternoons that referredthemselves for their character simply to sandy roads and primitivefarms, crooked inlets of mild sea and, at the richest, largepossibilities of worked cranberry-swamp. I remembered, in fine,Mattapoisett, I remembered Marion, as admirable examples of thatfrequent New England phenomenon, the case the consummate example ofwhich I was soon again to recognize in Newportthe presence of an_unreasoned_ appeal, in nature, to the sense of beauty, the appeal on abasis of items that failed somehow, count and recount them as one would,to justify the effect and make up the precious sum. The sum, at Newportabove all, as I was soon again to see, is the exquisite, theirresistible; but you falter before beginning to name the parts of theexplanation, conscious how short the list may appear. Thus everything,in the whole range of imagery, affirms itself and interposes; you will,you inwardly determine, arrive at some notation of manners even if youperish in the attempt. Thus, as I jogged southward, from Boston, in atrain that stopped and stopped again, for my fuller enlightenment, andthat insisted, the good old promiscuous American car itself, on havingas much of its native character as possible for my benefit, I alreadyknew I must fall back on old props of association, some revival of theprocess of seeing the land grow mild and vague and interchangeablyfamiliar with the sea, all under the spell of the reportedgulf-stream, those mystic words that breathe a softness wherever theysound.It was imperative here that they should do what they could for me, andthey must have been in full operation when, on my arrival at the smallstation from which I was to drive across to Cotuitacross the Cape, aswho should say, romantic thought, though I strain a point geographicallyfor the romanceI found initiation awaiting me in the form of minimizedhorse-and-buggy and minimized man. The man was a little boy in tightknickerbockers, the horse barely an animal at all, a mere ambling spiritin shafts on the scale of a hairpin, the buggy disembodied save for itswheels, the whole thing the barest infraction of the road, of the void:circumstances, altogether, that struck the note, the right, thepersistent onethat of my baffled endeavour, while in the neighbourhood,to catch life in the fact, and of my then having to recognize it aspresent _without_ facts, or with only the few (the little white houses,the feathery elms, the band of ocean blue, the stripe of sandy yellow,the tufted pines in angular silhouette, the cranberry-swamps stringedacross, for the picking, like the ruled pages of ledgers), that fell,incorruptibly silent, into the picture. We were still far from our goal,that first hour, when I had recognized the full pictorial and othervalue of my little boy and his little accessories; had seen, in theamiable waste that we continued to plough till we struck, almost with ashock, the inconsistency of a long stretch of new stone road, that,socially, economically, every contributive scrap of this detail wasrequired. I drained my small companion, by gentle pressure, of suchsidelights as he could project, consisting almost wholly, as they did,of a prompt and shrill, an oddly-emphasized Yes, _sir_! to eachinterrogative attempt to break ground. The summer people had alreadydepartedwith, as it seemed to me, undue precipitation; the very hoteloffered, in its many-windowed bulk, the semblance of a mere huge brittlesea-shell that children tired of playing with it have cast again uponthe beach; the alignments of white cottages were, once more, as if thechildren had taken, for a change, to building houses of cards and thenhad deserted _them_. I remember the sense that something _must_ be donefor penetration, for discovery; I remember an earnest stroll, undertakenfor a view of waterside life, which resulted in the perception of ayoung man, in a spacious but otherwise unpeopled nook, a clear,straightforward young man to converse with, for a grand opportunity,across the water, waist-high in the quiet tide and prodding thesea-bottom for oysters; also in the discovery of an animated centre ofindustry of which oysters again were the motive: a mute citizen or twopacking them in boxes, on the beach, for the Boston market, the hammerof some vague carpentry hard by, and, filling the air more than anythingelse, the unabashed discourse of three or four school-children atleisure, visibly prominent and apparently in charge of the life of theplace. I remember not less a longish walk, and a longer drive, into lowextensions of woody, piney, pondy landscape, veined with blue inlets andtrimmed, on opportunity, with blond beachesthrough all of which Ipursued in vain the shy spectre of a revelation. The only revelationseemed really to be that, quite as in New Hampshire, so many people hadleft that the remaining characters, on the sketchy page, were too fewto form a word. With this, accordingly, of what, in the bright air, forthe charmed visitor, were the softness and sweetness of impression_made_? I had again to take it for a mystery.                                   VThis was really, for that matter, but the first phase of a resumed, orrather of a greatly-enlarged, acquaintance with the New England villagein its most exemplary state: the state of being both sunned and shaded;of exhibiting more fresh white paint than can be found elsewhere inequal areas, and yet of correcting that conscious, that doubtless oftensomewhat embarrassed, hardness of countenance with an art of its own.The descriptive term is of the simplest, the term that suffices for thewhole family when at its best: having spoken of them as elm-shaded,you have said so much about them that little else remains. It is but aquestion, throughout, of the quantity, the density, of their shade;often so thick and ample, from May to November, that their function, inthe social, in the economic, order would seem on occasion to consistsolely of their being passive to that effect. To note the latter,accordingly, to praise it, to respond to its appeal for admiration,practically represents, as you pass beneath the great feathery arches,the only comment that may be addressed to the scene. The charmingthingif that be the best way to take itis that the scene is everywherethe same; whereby tribute is always ready and easy, and you are sparedall shocks of surprise and saved any extravagance of discrimination.These communities stray so little from the type, that you often askyourself by what sign or difference you know one from the other. Thegoodly elms, on either side of the large straight street, rise fromtheir grassy margin in double, ever and anon in triple, file; the whitepaint, on wooden walls, amid open dooryards, reaffirms itself eternallybehind themthough hanging back, during the best of the season, with asun-checkered, amusing vagueness; while the great verdurous vista, thehigh canopy of meeting branches, has the air of consciously playing thetrick and carrying off the picture. See with how little we do it; countover the elements and judge how few they are: in other words come backin winter, in the months of the naked glare, when the white paint looksdead and dingy against the snow, the poor dear old whitepaintimmemorial, ubiquitous, save as venturing into brown oryellowwhich is really all we have to build on! Some such sense as thatyou may catch from the murmur of the amiable elmsif you are a veryrestless analyst indeed, that is a very indiscreet listener.As you wouldnt, however, go back in winter on any account whatever, andleast of all for any such dire discovery, the picture hangs undisturbedin your gallery, and you even, with extended study of it, class it amongyour best mementos of the great autumnal harmony. The truth is that, forsix or seven weeks after the mid-September, among the mountains ofMassachusetts and Connecticut, the mere _fusion_ of earth and air andwater, of light and shade and colour, the almost shameless tolerance ofnature for the poor human experiment, are so happily effective that youlose all reckoning of the items of the sum, that you in short find inyour draught, contentedly, a single strong savour. By all of which Idont mean to say that this sweetness of the waning year has not moretaste in the presence of certain objects than in the presence of certainothers. Objects remarkable enough, objects rich and rare perhaps,objects at any rate curious and interesting, emerge, for genialreference, from the gorgeous blur, and would commit me, should I givethem their way, to excesses of specification. So I throw myself backupon the fusion, as I have called itwith the rich light hanging on buthalf-a-dozen spots. This renews the vision of the MassachusettsBerkshireland beyond any other, in America, to-day, as one was muchreminded, of leisure on the way to legitimation, of the social idyll, ofthe workable, the expensively workable, American form of country life;and, in especial, of a perfect consistency of surrender to the argumentof the verdurous vista. This is practically the last word of suchcommunities as Stockbridge, Pittsfield, Lenox, or of such villages asSalisbury and Farmington, over the Connecticut border. I speak ofconsistency in spite of the fact that it has doubtless here and there,under the planted elms, suffered some injury at the hands of the summerpeople; for really, beneath the wide mantle of parti-coloured Nature,nothing matters but the accidental liability of the mantle here andthere to fall thickest. Thus it is then that you do, after a little,differentiate, from place to place, and compare and even prefer; thus itis that you recognize a scale and a range of amplitudenay, more,wonderful to say, on occasion an emergence of detail; thus it is, infine, that, while accepting the just eminence of Stockbridge andPittsfield, for instance, you treat yourself on behalf of Farmington tosomething like a luxury of discrimination.I may perhaps not go the length of asserting that Farmington might braveundismayed the absolute removal of the mantle of charity; since thegreat elm-gallery there struck me as not less than elsewhere essentiallymistress of the scene. Only there were particular felicities therewithin the generaland anything very particular, in the land at large,always gave the case an appearance of rarity. When the great elm-galleryhappens to be garnished with old houses, and the old houses happen toshow style and form and proportion, and the hand of time, further, hasbeen so good as to rest on them with all the pressure of protection andnone of that of interference, then it is that the New England villagemay placidly await any comer. Farmington sits with this confidence onthe top of a ridge that presents itself in its fringed lengtha straightavenue seen in profileto the visitor taking his way from the stationacross a couple of miles of level bottom that speak, for New England, ofa luxury of culture; and nothing could be more fastidious andexceptional, and thereby more impressive in advance, than suchupliftedness of posture. What is it but the note of the aristocratic inan air that so often affects us as drained precisely, and well-nigh toour gasping, of any exception to the common? The indication I hereglance at secures for the place in advance, as you measure itsdetachment across the valley, a positively thrilled attention. Thencomes, under the canopy of autumn, your vision of the grounds of thismild haughtiness, every one of which you gratefully allow. Stay as manyhours as you willand my stay was but of hoursthey dont break down;you trace them into fifty minor titles and dignities, all charmingaspects and high refinements of the older New England domesticarchitecture. Not only, moreover, are the best houses so goodthe goodones are so surprisingly numerous. That is all they seem together tosay. We are good, yeswe are excellent; though, if we know it verywell, we make no vulgar noise about it: we only just stand here, in ourlong double line, in the manner of mature and just slightly-reducedgentlewomen seated against the wall at an evening party (some partywhere mature gentlewomen unusually abound), and neither too boldlyaffront the light nor shrink from the favouring shade. That again, onthe spot, is the discreet voice of the airwhich quavered away, for me,into still other admissions.It takes but the barest semitone to start the story-seeker curious ofmannersthe story-seeker impenitent and uncorrected, as happened in thiscase, by a lesson unmistakably received, or at least intended, a shorttime before. He had put a question, on that occasion, with an expectancydoubtless too crude; he had asked a resident of a large city of themiddle West what might be, credibly, the conditions of the lifesocially led there. He had not, at Farmington, forgotten the ominouspause that had preceded the reply: The conditions of the life? Why, thesame conditions as everywhere else. He had not forgotten, either, thethrill of his sense of this collapse of his interlocutor: the casebeing, obviously, that it is of the very nature of conditions, asreported on by the expertand it was to the expert he had appealedtovary from place to place, so that they fall into as many groups, andconstitute as many stamps, as there are different congregations of men.His interlocutor was not of the expert_that_ had really been thelesson; and it was with a far different poetry, the sweet shyness ofveracity, that Farmington confessed to idiosyncrasies. I have too littlespace, however, as I had then too little time, to pretend to have liftedmore than the smallest corner of this particular veil; besides which, ifit is of the essence of the land, in these regions, to throw you back,after a little, upon the possible humanities, so it often results fromthe social study, too baffling in many a case, that you are thrown backupon the land. That agreeable, if sometimes bewildering, seesaw isperhaps the best figure, in such conditions, for the restless analyststenor of life. It was an effect of the fusion he has endeavoured tosuggest; it is certainly true, at least, that, among the craggy hills,among little mountains that turned so easily, at any opening, toclearness of violet and blue, among the wood-circled dells that seemedto wait as for afternoon dances, among the horizons that recalled attheir will the Umbrian note and the finer drawing, every ugliness meltedand dropped, any wonderment at the other face of the medal seemed moretrouble than it was worth. It was enough that the white village or thepainted farm could gleam from afar, on the faintly purple slope, like athing of mystery or of history; it was enough that the charminghill-mass, happily presented and foreshortened, should lie there likesome beast, almost heraldic, resting his nose on his paws.Those images, for retrospect, insistently supplant the others; though Ihave notes enough, I find, about the others tooabout the inscrutabilityof the village street in general, for instance, in any relation but itsrelation to its elms. What _they_ seemed to say is what I havementioned; but what secrets, meanwhile, did the rest of the scene keep?_Were_ there any secrets at all, or had the outward blankness, thequantity of absence, as it were, in the air, its inward equivalent aswell? There was the high, thin church, made higher, made highest, andsometimes, as at Farmington, made as pretty as a monstrous Dutch toy, byits steeple of quaint and classic carpentry; but this monument appearedto _testify_ scarce more than some large white card, embellished with astencilled border, on which a message or a sentence, an invitation or arevelation, might be still to be inscribed. The present, the positive,was mainly represented, ever, by the level railway-crossing, gainingexpression from its localization of possible death and destruction,where the great stilted, strident, yet so almost comically impersonaltrain, which, with its so often undesignated and so always unservantedstations, and its general air of bossing the neighbourhoods it warns,for climax of its characteristic curtness, to look out for its rush,is everywhere a large contribution to ones impression of a kind ofmonotony of acquiescence. This look as of universal acquiescence playssomehow through the visible vacancyseems a part of the thinness, thepassivity, of that absence of the settled standard which contains, as Imore and more felt, from day to day, the germ of the most final of allmy generalizations. I neednt be too prompt with itso much higher mayit hold its head, I foresee, when it flowers, perfectly, as aconclusion, than when it merely struggles through the side of thesubject as a tuft for provisional clutching. It sprouts in that soil,none the less, betimes, this apprehension that the common man and thecommon woman have here their appointed paradise and sphere, and that thesign of it is the abeyance, on many a scene, of any wants, any tastes,any habits, any traditions but theirs. The bullying railway orders themoff their own decent avenue without a fear that they will stand up toit; the tone of the picture is the pitch of their lives, and when youlisten to what the village street seems to say, marking it, at the end,with your Is that _all_? it is as if you had had your account of ascheme fashioned preponderantly in their image.I mean in _theirs_ exactly, with as little provision for what is toofoul for them as for what is too fair: the very middle, the golden mean,of the note of the common, to which the two extremes of condition areequally wanting; though with the mark strongest, if anywhere, againstdusky misfortune and precarious dependence. The romance of costume, forbetter or worse, the implication of vices, accomplishments, manners,accents, attitudes, is as absent for evil as for good, for a lowconnection as for a high: which is why the simplification covers so muchground, that of public houses, that of kinds of people, that ofsuggestions, however faint, of discernible opportunity, of anydeviation, in other words, into the _un_common. There are no kinds ofpeople; there are simply people, very, very few, and all of one kind,the kind who thus simply invest themselves for you in the grey truththat they dont go to the public house. Its a negative garment, but itmust serve you; which it makes shift to do while you keep on asking,from the force of acquired habit, what may be behind, what beneath, whatwithin, what may represent, in such conditions, the appeal of the sensesor the tribute to them; what, in such a show of life, may take the place(to put it as simply as possible) of amusement, of social and sensualmargin, overflow and by-play. Of course there is by-play here and there;here and there, of course, extremes _are_ touched: otherwise, the wholeconcretion, in its thinness, would crack, and the fact is that two orthree of these strong patches of surface-embroidery remain with me ascurious and interesting. Never was such by-play as in a great new houseon a hilltop that overlooked the most composed of communities; a houseapparently conceivedand with great felicityon the lines of a magnifiedMount Vernon, and in which an array of modern impressionisticpictures, mainly French, wondrous examples of Manet, of Degas, of ClaudeMonet, of Whistler, of other rare recent hands, treated us to themomentary effect of a large slippery sweet inserted, without a warning,between the compressed lips of half-conscious inanition. One hadntquite known one was starved, but the morsel went down by the mereauthority of the thing consummately _prepared_. Nothing else had been,in all the circle, prepared to anything like the same extent; and thoughthe consequent taste, as a mixture with the other tastes, was of thequeerest, no proof of the sovereign power of art could have been, forthe moment, sharper. It happened to be that particular artit might aswell, no doubt, have been another; it made everything else shrivel andfade: it was like the sudden trill of a nightingale, lord of the hushedevening.These appeared to be, over the land, always possible adventures;obviously I should have others of the same kind; I could let them, inall confidence, accumulate and wait. But, if that was one kind ofextreme, what meanwhile was the other kind, the kind portentouslyalluded to by those of the sagacious who had occasionally put it beforeme that the village street, the arched umbrageous vista, half so candidand half so cool, is too frequently, in respect to morals, but awhited sepulchre? They had so put it before me, these advisers, but theyhad as well, absolutely and all tormentingly, so left it: partly as ifthe facts were too abysmal for a permitted distinctness, and partly, nodoubt, as from the general American habit of indirectness, of positiveprimness, of allusion to those matters that are sometimes collectivelyspoken of as the great facts of life. It had been intimated to me thatthe great facts of life are in high fermentation on the other side ofthe ground glass that never for a moment flushes, to the casual eye,with the hint of a lurid light: so much, at least, one had noalternative, under pressure, but to infer. The inference, however, stillleft the question a prey to vaguenessit being obvious that vicerequires forms not less than virtue, or perhaps even more, and thatforms, up and down the prospect, were exactly what one waited in vainfor. The theory that no community _can_ live wholly without by-play, andthe confirmatory word, for the particular case, of more initiatedreporters, these things were all very well; but before a scene peeled asbare of palpable pretext as the American sky is often peeled of clouds(in the interest of the slightly acid juice of its light), where and howwas the application to be made? It came at last, the applicationthat, Imean, of the portentous hint; and under it, after a fashion, theelements fell together. Why the picture _shouldnt_ bristle with thetruththat was all conceivable; that the truth could only strike inward,horribly inward, not playing up to the surfacethis too needed noinsistence; what was sharpest for reflection being, meanwhile, a coupleof minor appearances, which one gathered as one went. That our littlearts of pathetic, of humorous, portrayal may, for all their claim to anedifying realism, have on occasion small veracity and couragethatagain was a remark pertinent to the matter. But the strangest link inthe chain, and quite the horridest, was this other, of high value to therestless analystthat, as the interesting puts in its note but whereit can and where it will, so the village street and the lonely farm andthe hillside cabin became positively richer objects under the smutch ofimputation; twitched with a grim effect the thinness of their mantle,shook out of its folds such crudity and levity as they might, andborrowed, for dignity, a shade of the darkness of Cencidrama, ofmonstrous legend, of old Greek tragedy, and thus helped themselves outfor the story-seeker more patient almost of anything than of flatness.There was not flatness, accordingly, though there might be diredreariness, in some of those impressions gathered, for a climax, in theBerkshire country of Massachusetts, which forced it upon the fancy thathere at last, in far, deep mountain valleys, where the winter is fierceand the summer irresponsible, was that heart of New England which makesso pretty a phrase for print and so stern a fact, as yet, for feeling.During the great loops thrown out by the lasso of observation from thewonder-working motor-car that defied the shrinkage of autumn days, thisremained constantly the best formula of the impression and even of theemotion; it sat in the vehicle with us, but spreading its wings to themagnificence of movement, and gathering under them indeed most of themeanings of the picture. The heart of New England, at this rate, was anample, a generous, heart, the largest demands on which, as to extent andvariety, seemed not to overstrain its capacity. But it was where themountain-walls rose straight and made the valleys happiest orsaddestone couldnt tell which, as to the felicity of the image, and itdidnt much matterthat penetration was, for the poetry of it, deepest;just as generalization, for an opposite sort of beauty, was grandest onthose several occasions when we perched for a moment on the summit of apass, a real little pass, slowly climbed to and keeping its otherside, with an art all but Alpine, for a complete revelation, and hungthere over the full vertiginous effect of the long and steep descent,the clinging road, the precipitous fall, the spreading, shimmering landbounded by blue horizons. We liked the very vocabulary, reduced towhatever minimum, of these romanticisms of aspect; again and again theland would do beautifully, if that were all that was wanted, and itdeserved, the dear thing, thoroughly, any verbal caress, any tendernessof term, any share in a claim to the grand manner, to which we couldresponsively treat it. The grand manner was in the winding ascent, therocky defile, the sudden rest for wonder, and all the splendid reverseof the medal, the world belted afresh as with purple sewn withpearlsmelting, in other words, into violet hills with vague white townson their breasts.That was, at the worst, for October afternoons, the motor helping, ourfrequent fare; the habit of confidence in which was, perhaps, on nooccasion so rewarded as on that of a particular plunge, from one of thehighest places, through an ebbing golden light, into the great Lebanonbowl, the vast, scooped hollow in one of the hither depths of which(given the quarter of our approach) we found the Shaker settlement oncemore or less, I believe, known to fame, ever so grimly planted. Thegrimness, even, was all right, when once we had admiringly dropped downand down and down; it would have done for that of a Buddhist monasteryin the Himalayasthough more savagely clean and more economicallyimpersonal, we seemed to make out, than the communities of older faithsare apt to show themselves. I remember the mere chill of contiguity,like the breath of the sepulchre, as we skirted, on the wide, hard floorof the valley, the rows of gaunt windows polished for no whitest,stillest, meanest face, even, to look out; so that they resembled theparallelograms of black paint criss-crossed with white lines thatrepresent transparency in Nuremberg dolls-houses. It wore, the wholesettlement, as seen from without, the strangest air of active, operativedeath; as if the state of extinction were somehow, obscurely,administered and appliedthe final hush of passions, desires, dangers,converted into a sort of huge stiff brush for sweeping away rubbish, orstill more, perhaps, into a monstrous comb for raking in profit. Thewhole thing had the oddest appearance of mortification made to pay.This was really, however, sounding the heart of New England beyond itsdepth, for I am not sure that the New York boundary had not been, justthere, overpassed; there flowered out of that impression, at any rate,another adventure, the very bravest possible for a shortened day, ofwhich the motive, whether formulated or not, had doubtless virtuallybeen to feel, with a far-stretched arm, for the heart of New York. _Had_New York, the miscellaneous monster, a heart at all?this inquiry, amidso much encouraged and rewarded curiosity, might have been well on theway to become sincere, and we kept groping, between a prompt start andan extremely retarded return, for any stray sign of an answer.The answer, perhaps, in the event, still eluded us, but the pursuititself, away across State lines, through zones of other manners, throughimages of other ideals, through densities of other values, into aseparate sovereign civilization in shortthis, with a view of theautumnal Hudson for an added incentive, became, in all the conditions,one of the finer flowers of experience. To be on the lookout fordifferences was, not unnaturally, to begin to meet them just over theborder and see them increase and multiply; was, indeed, with a mildconsistency, to feel it steal over us that we were, as we advanced, in alooser, shabbier, perhaps even rowdier world, where the roads were of aneasier virtue and the farms of a scantier pride, where the absence ofthe ubiquitous sign-post of New England, joy of lonely corners, left thegreat spaces with an accent the less; where, in fine, the waysidebravery of the commonwealth of Massachusetts settled itself, for memory,all serenely, to suffer by no comparison whatever. And yet it wasnt,either, that this other was not also a big, bold country, with ridgeupon ridge and horizon by horizon to deal with, insistently, pantingly,puffingly, pausingly, before the great river showed signs of taking upthe tale with its higher hand; it wasnt, above all, that the moststriking signs by which the nearness of the river was first announced,three or four fine old houses overlooking the long road, reputedly Dutchmanors, seats of patriarchs and patroons, and unmistakably rich valuesin the vast, vague scene, had not a nobler archaic note than even thebest of the New England colonial; it wasnt that, finally, the Hudson,when we reached the town that repeats in so minor a key the name of thestream, was not autumnal indeed, with majestic impenetrable mists thatveiled the waters almost from sight, showing only the dim Catskills, offin space, as perfunctory graces, cheaply thrown in, and leaving us toroam the length of a large straight street which was, yes, decidedly,for comparison, for curiosity, not as the streets of Massachusetts.The best here, to speak of, was that the motor underwent repair and thatits occupants foraged for dinnerfinding it indeed excellently at aquiet cook-shop, about the middle of the long-drawn way, after we hadencountered coldness at the door of the main hotel by reason of ourFrench poodle. This personage had made our group, admirably composed toour own sense as it was, only the more illustrious; but mindsindifferent to an opportunity of intercourse, if but the intercourse ofmere vision, with fine French poodles, may be taken always as sufferingwhere they have sinned. The hospitality of the cook-shop was meanwhiletouchingly, winningly unconditioned, yet full of character, of local, ofnational truth, as we liked to think: documentary, in a high degreewetalked it overfor American life. Wasnt it interesting that withAmerican life so personally, so freely affirmed, the superstition ofcookery should yet be so little denied? It was the queer old complexionof the long straight street, however, that most came home to me: Hudson,in the afternoon quiet, seemed to stretch back, with fumbling friendlyhand, to the earliest outlook of my consciousness. Many matters had comeand gone, innumerable impressions had supervened; yet here, in the stirof the senses, a whole range of small forgotten things revived, thingsintensely Hudsonian, more than Hudsonian; small echoes and tones andsleeping lights, small sights and sounds and smells that made one, foran hour, _as_ smallcarried one up the rest of the river, the very riverof life indeed, as a thrilled, roundabouted pilgrim, by primitivesteamboat, to a mellow, medival Albany.                                   VIIt is a convenience to be free to confess that the play of perceptionduring those first weeks was quickened, in the oddest way, by thewonderment (which was partly also the amusement) of my finding how manycorners of the general, of the local, picture had anciently never beenunveiled for me at all, and how many unveiled too briefly and tooscantly, with quite insufficient bravery of gesture. That might make oneask by what strange law one had lived in the other time, with gaps, tothat number, in ones experience, in ones consciousness, with so manymuffled spots in ones general vibrationand the answer indeed to such aquestion might carry with it an infinite penetration of retrospect, apenetration productive of ghostly echoes as sharp sometimes as aches orpangs. So many had been the easy things, the contiguous places, theconspicuous objects, to right or to left of the path, that had beeneither unaccountably or all too inevitably left undiscovered, and whichwere to live on, to the inner vision, through the long years, as mereblank faces, round, empty, metallic, senseless disks dangling fromfamiliar and reiterated names. Why, at the same time, one might ask, hadthe consciousness of irritation from these vain forms not grown greater?why had the inconvenience, or the disgrace, of early privation become anaccepted memory? All, doubtless, in the very interest, precisely, ofthis eventual belated romance, and so that adventures, even of minortype, so preposterously postponed should be able to deck themselves atlast with a kind of accumulation of freshness.So the freshness, all the autumn, kept breaking through thestalenesswhen the staleness, so agreeably flavoured with hospitality,and indeed with new ingredients, was a felt element at all. There wasafter all no moment perhaps at which one element stood out so verysharply from the otherthe hundred emendations and retouches of the oldpicture, its greater depth of tone, greater show of detail, greater sizeand scale, tending by themselves to confound and mislead, in a manner,the lights and shades of remembrance. Very promptly, in the Bostonneighbourhoods, the work of time loomed large, and the difference madeby it, as one might say, for the general richness. The richness mighthave its poverties still and the larger complexity its crudities; but,all the same, to look back was to seem to have been present at anextraordinary general process, that of the rapid, that of the ceaselessrelegation of the _previous_ (on the part of the whole visible order) toone of the wan categories of misery. What was taking place was aperpetual repudiation of the past, so far as there had been a past torepudiate, so far as the past was a positive rather than a negativequantity. There had been plenty in it, assuredly, of the negative, andthat was but a shabbiness to disown or a deception to expose; yet therehad been an old conscious commemorated life too, and it was this thathad become the victim of supersession. The pathos, so to call it, of theimpression was somehow that it didnt, the earlier, simpler condition,still resist or protest, or at all expressively flush through; it wasconsenting to become a past with all the fine candour with which it hadtried to affirm itself, in its day, as a presentand very much, for thatmatter, as with a due ironic forecast of the fate in store for thehungry, triumphant actual.This savours perhaps of distorted reflection, but there was really alight over it in which the whole spectacle was to shine. _The will togrow_ was everywhere written large, and to grow at no matter what orwhose expense. I had naturally seen it before, I had seen it, on theother side of the world, in a thousand places and forms, a thousand hitsand misses: these things are the very screeches of the pipe to whichhumanity is actually dancing. But here, clearly, it was a question ofscale and space and chance, margin and elbow-room, the quantity of floorand loudness of the dance-music; a question of the ambient air, aboveall, the permitting medium, which had at once, for the visitorspersonal inhalation, a dry taste in the mouth. Thin and clear andcolourless, what would it ever say no to? or what would it ever paintthick, indeed, with sympathy and sanction? With so little, accordingly,within the great frame of the picture, to prevent or to prescribe, itwas as if anything might be done there that any sufficient number ofsubscribers to any sufficient number of sufficiently noisy newspapersmight want. That, moreover, was but another name for the largest andstraightest perception the restless analyst had yet risen totheperception that awaits the returning absentee from this great country,on the wharf of disembarkation, with an embodied intensity that nosuperficial confusion, no extremity of chaos any more than any briefmercy of accident, avails to mitigate. The waiting observer need belittle enough of an analyst, in truth, to arrive at that consciousness,for the phenomenon is vivid in direct proportion as the ship draws near.The great presence that bristles for him on the sounding dock, and thatshakes the planks, the loose boards of its theatric stage to aninordinate unprecedented rumble, is the monstrous form of Democracy,which is thereafter to project its shifting angular shadow, at one timeand another, across every inch of the field of his vision. It is thehuge democratic broom that has made the clearance and that one seems tosee brandished in the empty sky.That is of course on one side no great discovery, for what does even thesimplest soul ever sail westward for, at this time of day, if not toprofit, so far as possible, by the working of democratic institutions?The political, the civic, the economic view of them is a study that maybe followed, more or less, at a distance; but the way in which theydetermine and qualify manners, feelings, communications, modes ofcontact and conceptions of lifethis is a revelation that has its fullforce and its lively interest only on the spot, where, when once caught,it becomes the only clue worth mentioning in the labyrinth. Thecondition, notoriously, represents an immense boon, but what does theenjoyment of the boon represent? The clue is never out of your hands,whatever other objects, extremely disconnected from it, may appear atthe moment to fill them. The democratic consistency, consummately andimmitigably complete, shines through with its hard light, whateverequivocal gloss may happen momentarily to prevail. You may talk of otherthings, and you do, as much as possible; but you are really thinking ofthat one, which has everything else at its mercy. What indeed is thiscircumstance that the condition is thus magnified but the commandingvalue of the picture, its message and challenge to intelligentcuriosity? Curiosity is fairly fascinated by the sense of the immensityof the chance, and by the sense that the whole of the chance has beentaken. It is rarely given to us to see a great game played as to thevery endand that was where, with his impression of nothing to prevent,of nothing, anywhere around him, to prevent anything, the ancientcontemplative person, floating serenely in his medium, had yetoccasionally to gasp before the assault of the quantity of illustration.The illustration might be, enormously, of something deficient, absentinwhich case it was for the aching void to be (as an aching void) strikingand interesting. As an explication or an implication the democraticintensity could always figure.                                  VIIThere was little need, for that matter, to drag it into the foregroundon the evening of my renewed introduction to the particular Bostonneighbourhoodthe only one of them allwith which I had been formerlysomewhat acquainted. I had alighted in New York but three days before,and my senses were all so full of it that as I look back I can againfeel it, under the immediate Cambridge impression, assert itself byturning quite to insidious softness, to confused and surprisedrecognition. I had driven out from Boston through the warm Septembernight and through a town-picture as of extraordinary virtuous vacancy(without so much as the figure of a policeman in sight from the SouthStation to the region of Harvard Square), and I remember how the odoroushourcharged with the old distinctively American earth-smell, which inthe darkness fairly poetized the suburbs, and with the queer, far, wildthrob of shrilling insectsprescribed to me the exact form of theresponse to the question as to ones sense of a great change alreadyso often sounded. A great change? No change at all. Where then wouldthe intensity be? But _changes_ever so many and so amusing and soagreeable. The intensity is compatible with _them_nothing, clearly, isgoing to be so interesting as to make out, with plenty of good-will, howcompatible! There was unmistakably everywhere a more embroideredsurfacethe new free figures played over the canvas; so that at thisrate, in the time to come, how far might the embroidery not go, whatsilk and gold mightnt it weave into the pattern? It wasnt of course aquestion of rhapsodizingCambridge was Cambridge still, and all faithfulto its type; but the rustle of the trees in the summer night had alarger tone, the more frequent lamplight slept on ampler walls, the bodyof impression was greater and the University, above all, seemed in moreconfident possession. It massed there in multiplied forms, with new andstrange architectures looming through the dark; it appeared to havewandered wide and to be stretching forth, in many directions, long,acquisitive arms.This vision, for the moment, of a great dim, clustered but restlesslyexpansive Harvard, hushed to vacation stillness as to a deep ambitiousdream, was, for the impressible story-seeker, practically the germ ofthe most engaging of the generalized images of reassurance, thefurniture, so to speak, of the _other_ scale, that the extension of hisview was to cause him to cultivate. Reassurance is required, before thespectacle of American manners at large, whenever one most acutelyperceives how little honour they tend to heap on the art ofdiscrimination, and it is at such hours that, turning in his frequentstupefaction, the restless analyst reaches out for support to thenearest faint ghost of a constituted Faculty. It takes no exceptionalexposure to the promiscuous life to show almost any institutionpretending to university form as stamped here with the character andfunction of the life-saving monasteries of the dark ages. They glow, thehumblest of them, to the imaginationthe imagination that fixes thesurrounding scene as a huge Rappacini-garden, rank with each variety ofthe poison-plant of the money-passionthey glow with all the vividnessof the defined alternative, the possible antidote, and seem to call onus to blow upon the flame till it is made inextinguishable. So littletime had it taken, at any rate, to suggest to me that a new and higherprice, in American conditions, is attaching to the cloister,literallythe place inaccessible (to put it most pertinently) to theshout of the newspaper, the place to perambulate, the place to think,apart from the crowd. Doubtless indeed I was not all aware of it at thetime, but the image I touch upon in connection with those first momentswas to remain with me, the figure of the rich old Harvard organismbrooding, exactly, through the long vacation, brooding through thesummer night, on discriminations, on insistences, on sublime andexquisite heresies to come.After that arrived daylight recognitions, but they were really for themost part offered me, as in a full cup, by the accident of a couple ofhours that were to leave me the pure essence, the finer sense of them.These were a matter of a fortnight later, as I had had immediately tomake an absence, and the waning September afternoon of the secondoccasion took on a particular quality for this deferred surrender of adozen stored secrets. Secrets I call them because the total impressionwas of the production of some handful of odds and ends that had lurked,for long, in a locked drawer, and which, being brought out, mightpromote, by their blinking consciousness, either derision or respect.They excited, as befell, an extraordinary tendernesson which conclusionit was fortunate to be able afterwards to rest. I wandered, for thedays end, with a young modern for whom the past had not been and whowas admirably unconscious of the haunting moral of the wholemutationthe tune to which the pampered present made the other time lookcomparatively grim. Each item of the pampered state contributed to thiseffectthe finer _mise en scne_, the multiplied resources, halls,faculties, museums, undergraduate and postgraduate habitations (theselast of so large a luxury); the pompous little club-houses, visited, allvacant, in the serious tell-tale twilight that seemed to give them,intellectually, away; the beautiful new Union, with its great gravenoble hall, of which there would be so much more to be said; and aboveall, doubtless, the later majesties of the Law School, in the nearpresence of which the tiny old disinherited seat of that subject,outfaced and bedimmed, seemed unable to make even a futile plea forquaintness. I went into the new Law Library, immense and supremein theshadow of which I caught myself sniffing the very dust, prehistoric butstill pungent, of the old. I saw in the distance a distinguished friend,all alone, belatedly working there, but to go to him I should have hadto cross the bridge that spans the gulf of time, and, with a suspicionof weak places, I was nervous about its bearing me.What such delicacies came to, then and afterwards, for the wholeimpression, was the instinct not to press, not to push on, till forced,through any half-open door of the real. The real was there, certainlyenough, outside and all round, but there was standing-ground, moreimmediately, for a brief idyll, and one would walk in the idyll, if onlyfrom hour to hour, while one could. This could but mean that one wouldcultivate the idyllic, for the social, for the pictorial illusion, byevery invoking and caressing art; and in fact, as a consequence, thereflection of our observers experience for the next few weeksthat isso long as the spell of the autumn lastedwould be but the history ofhis more or less ingenious arts. With the breaking of the autumn, lateron, everything broke, everything wenteverything was transposed at leastinto another key. But for the time so much had been gainedthe happytrick had been played.                                  VIIIIt was after all in the great hall of the Union perhaps (to come back tothat delicate days end) that the actual vibration of response seemedmost to turn to audible musicrepeated, with all its suggestiveness, onanother occasion or two. For the case was unmistakably that just there,more than anywhere, by a magnificent stroke, an inspiration workingperhaps even beyond its consciousness, the right provision had been madefor the remembering mind. The place was addressed in truth so largely toan enjoying and producing future that it might seem to frown on merecommemoration, on the backward vision; and yet, at the moment I speakof, its very finest meaning might have been that of a liberal monumentto those who had come and gone, to the company of the lurking ghosts.The air there was full of them, and this was its service, that it caredfor them all, and so eased off the intensity of their appeal. And yet itappeared to play that part for a reason more interesting than reducibleto wordsa reason that mainly came out for me while, in the admirablehall aforesaid, I stood before Sargents high portrait of Major HenryLee Higginson, _donatorio_ of the house (as well as author, all roundabout, of innumerable other civil gifts); a representation of life andcharacter, a projection of genius, which even that great painter hasnever outdone. Innumerable, ever, are the functions performed and theblessings wrought by the supreme work of art, but I know of no case inwhich it has been so given to such a work to make the human statementwith a great effect, to interfuse a group of public acts with thepersonality, with the characteristics, of the actor. The acts wouldstill have had all their value if the portrait had had less, but theywould not assuredly have been able to become so interesting, would nothave grown to affect each beneficiary, however obscure, as proceeding,for him, from a possible relation, a possible intimacy. It is to thequestion of intimacy with somebody or other that all great practicalpublic recognition is finally carried backbut carried only by the magiccarpet, when the magic carpet happens to be there. Mr. Sargentsportrait of Henry Higginson is exactly the magic carpet.That was the pull (one kept on feeling) that this happy commemorativecreation of the Union had over the great official, the great bristlingbrick Valhalla of the early seventies, that house of honour and ofhospitality which, under the name of the Alumni Hall, dispenses (apartfrom its containing a noble auditorium) laurels to the dead and dinnersto the living. The recording tablets of the members of the Universitysacrificed, on the Northern side, in the Civil War, are too impressivenot to retain here always their collective beauty; but the monumentaloffice and character suffer throughout from the too scant presence ofthe massive and the mature. The great structure speads and soars withthe best will in the world, but succeeds in resembling rather somehigh-masted ship at sea, in slightly prosaic equilibrium, than a thingof builded foundations and embrasured walls. To which it is impossiblenot immediately to add that these distinctions are relative and thesecomparisons almost odious, in face of the recent generations, gatheredin from beneath emptier skies, who must have found in the big buildingas it stands an admonition and an ideal. So much the better for the bigbuilding, assuredly, and none so calculably the worse for thegenerations themselves. The reflection follows close moreover that,tactfully speaking, criticism has no close concern with Alumni Hall; itis as if that grim visitor found the approaches closed to himhad toenter, to the loss of all his identity, some relaxing air of meresentimental, mere shameless association. He turns his back, a trifleruefully whistling, and wanders wide; so at least I seemed to see himdo, all September, all October, and hereabouts in particular: I felt himresignedly reduced, for the time, to looking over, to looking through,the fenceall the more that at Cambridge there was at last something inthe nature of a fence so to be dealt with.The smaller aspects, the sight of mere material arrears made up, mayseem unduly to have held me when I say that few fresh circumstancesstruck me as falling more happily into the picture than this especialdecency of the definite, the palpable affirmation and belateddelimitation of College Yard. The high, decorated, recurrent gates andthe still insufficiently high iron palingsrepresenting a vast ring andeven now incompletemay appear, in spots, extemporized and thin; butthat signifies little in presence of the precious idea on the side ofwhich, in the land of the open door, the all-abstract outline, thetimid term and the general concession, they bravely range themselves.The open dooras it figures here in respect to everything but trademaymake a magnificent place, but it makes poor places; and in places,despite our large mistrust of privacy, and until the national ingenuityshall have invented a substitute for them, we must content ourselveswith living. This especial drawing of the belt at Harvard is anadmirably interesting example of the way in which the formal enclosureof objects at all interesting immediately refines upon their interest,immediately establishes values. The enclosure may be impressive fromwithout, but from within it is sovereign; nothing is more curious thanto trace in the aspects so controlled the effect of their establishedrelation to it. This resembles, in the human or social order, theimproved situation of the foundling who has discovered his family or ofthe actor who has mastered his part.The older buildings, in the Yard, profit indeed, on the spot, to thestory-seeking mind, by the fact of their comparative exhibition of thetone of timeso prompt an ecstasy and so deep a relief reward, inAmerica, everywhere, any suggested source of interest that is not theinterest of importunate newness. That source overflows, all others runthin; but the wonder and the satisfaction are that in College Yard morethan one of these should have finally been set to running thick. Thebest pieces of the earlier cluster, from Massachusetts to Stoughton,emerge from their elongation of history with a paler archaic pink intheir brickwork; their scant primitive details, small quaintnesses ofform, have turned, each, to the expressive accent that no short-cut ofstyle can ever successfully imitate, and from their many-panedwindows, where, on the ensconced benches, so many generations havelooked out, they fall, in their minor key, into the great main currentof ghostly gossip. See, see, we are getting on, we are getting almostripe, ripe enough to justify the question of taste about us. We aregrowing a complexionwhich takes almost as long, and is in fact prettywell the same thing, as growing a philosophy; but we are putting it onand entering into the dignity of time, the beauty of life. We are in aword beginning to begin, and we have that best sign of it, havent we?that we make the vulgar, the very vulgar, think we are beginning toend.That moreover was not the only relation thus richly promoted; therecould be no unrest of analysis worthy of the name that failed toperceive how, after term had opened, the type of the young men comingand going in the Yard gained, for vivacity of appeal, through this moremarked constitution of a _milieu_ for it. Here, verily, questions couldswarm; for there was scarce an impression of the local life at largethat didnt play into them. One thing I had not yet doneI had not been,under the best guidance, out to Ellis Island, the seat of theCommissioner of Immigration, in the bay of New York, to catch in thefact, as I was to catch later on, a couple of hours of the ceaselessprocess of the recruiting of our race, of the plenishing of our hugenational _pot au feu_, of the introduction of freshof perpetually freshso far it isnt perpetually staleforeign matter into our heterogeneoussystem. But even without that a haunting wonder as to what might bebecoming of us all, typically, ethnically, and therebyphysiognomically, linguistically, _personally_, was always in order. Theyoung men in their degree, as they flocked candidly up to college,struck me as having much to say about it, and there was always the senseof light on the subject, for comparison and reference, that a longexperience of other types and other manners could supply. Swarmingingenuous youths, _whom did they look like the sons of_?that inquiry,as to any group, any couple, any case, represented a game that it waspositively thrilling to play out. There was plenty to make it so, forthere was, to begin with, both the forecast of the thing that mighteasily settle the issue and the forecast of the thing that might easilycomplicate it.No impression so promptly assaults the arriving visitor of the UnitedStates as that of the overwhelming preponderance, wherever he turns andtwists, of the unmitigated business-man face, ranging through itsvarious possibilities, its extraordinary actualities, of intensity. AndI speak here of facial cast and expression alone, leaving out of accountthe questions of voice, tone, utterance and attitude, the chorus ofwhich would vastly swell the testimony and in which I seem to discern,for these remarks at large, a treasure of illustration to come. Nothing,meanwhile, is more concomitantly striking than the fact that the women,over the landallowing for every element of exceptionappear to be of amarkedly finer texture than the men, and that one of the liveliest signsof this difference is precisely in their less narrowly specialized,their less commercialized, distinctly more generalized, physiognomiccharacter. The superiority thus noted, and which is quite another matterfrom the universal fact of the mere usual female femininity, is far fromconstituting absolute distinction, but it constitutes relative, and itis a circumstance at which interested observation snatches, from thefirst, with an immense sense of its _porte_. There are, with all thequalifications it is yet open to, fifty reflections to be made upon thetruth it seems to represent, the appearance of a queer deep split orchasm between the two stages of personal polish, the two levels of theconversable state, at which the sexes have arrived. It is at all eventsno exaggeration to say that the imagination at once embraces it as _the_feature of the social scene, recognizing it as a subject fruitful beyondthe common, and wondering even if for pure drama, the drama of manners,anything anywhere else touches it. If it be a subject, verilywith thebig vision of the intersexual relation as, at such an increasing rate, aprey to itthe right measure for it would seem to be offered in the artof the painter of life by the concrete example, the art of the dramatistor the novelist, rather than in that of the talker, the reporter atlarge. The only thing is that, from the moment the painter begins tolook at American life brush in hand, he is in danger of seeing, incomparison, almost nothing else in itnothing, that is, socharacteristic as this apparent privation, for the man, of his rightkind of woman, and this apparent privation, for the woman, of her rightkind of man.The right kind of woman for the American man may really be, of course,as things are turning out with him, the woman as to whom his mostworkable relation is to support her and bear with herjust as the rightkind of man for the American woman may really be the man who intervenesin her life only by occult, by barely divinable, by practicallydisavowed courses. But the ascertainment and illustration of thesetruths would be, exactly, very conceivably high sport for the ironicpoetwho has surely hitherto neglected one of his greatest currentopportunities. It in any case remains vivid that American life may, asregards much of its manifestation, fall upon the earnest view as asociety of women located in a world of men, which is so different amatter from a collection of men of the world; the men supplying, as itwere, all the canvas, and the women all the embroidery. Just thisvividness it was that held up the torch, through the Cambridge autumn,to that question of the affiliation of the encountered Harvardundergraduate which I may not abandon. In what proportion of instanceswould it stick out that the canvas, rather than the embroidery, was whathe had to show? In what proportion would he wear the stamp of theunredeemed commercialism that should betray his paternity? In whatproportion, in his appearance, would the different social valueimputable to his mother have succeeded in interposing? The discernedanswer to these inquiries is really, after all, too precious (in itscharacter of contribution to ones total gathered wisdom) to be givenaway prematurely; but there was at least always the sense, to which theimagination reverted, that in the collegiate cloisters and academicshades of other countries this absence of a possible _range_ of originand breeding in a young type had not been so felt. The question oforigin, the question of breeding, had been largenever settled inadvance; there had been fifty _sorts_ of persons, fifty representativesof careers, to whom the English, the French, the German universitarianof tender years might refer you for a preliminary account of him.I speak of my keeping back, for the present, many of my ultimateperceptions, but I may none the less recall my having had, all theseason, from early, the ring in my ears of a reply I had heard made, onthe spot, to a generous lady offering entertainment to a guest, astranger to the scene, whose good impression she had had at heart. Whatkind of people should I like to meet? Why, my dear madam, have you morethan _one_ kind? At the same time that I could remember this, however,I could also remember that the consistently _bourgeois_ fathers mustthemselves in many cases have had mothers whose invitation to their maleoffspring to clutch at their relatively finer type had not succeeded ingetting itself accepted. That constituted a fatal precedent, and itwould have to be in the female offspring, probably, that one should lookfor evidences of the clutchingan extension of the inquiry for whichthere was plenty of time. What did escape from submersion, meanwhile, asis worth mentioning, was the golden state of being reminded at momentsthat there are no such pleasure-giving accidents, for the mind, asviolations of the usual in conditions that make them really precariousand rare. As the usual, in our vast crude democracy of trade, is thenew, the simple, the cheap, the common, the commercial, the immediate,and, all too often, the ugly, so any human product that those elementsfail conspicuously to involve or to explain, any creature, or even anyfeature, not turned out to pattern, any form of suggested rarity,subtlety, ancientry, or other pleasant perversity, prepares for us arecognition akin to rapture. These lonely ecstasies of the truly opensense make up often, in the hustling, bustling desert, for suchsinkings of the starved stomach as have led one too often to have totighten ones sthetic waistband.                                   IXAll of which is sufficiently to imply, again, that for adventurouscontemplation, at any of the beguiled hours of which I pretend here butto give the general happier drift, there was scarce such a thing as avariation of insistence. As every fact was convertible into a fancy,there was only an encouraged fusion of possible felicities and possiblemistakes, stop-gaps before the awful advent of a serious sense ofcritical responsibility. Or say perhaps rather, to alter the image,that there was only a builded breakwater against the assault of mattersdemanding a _literal_ notation. I walked, at the best, but on thebreakwaterlooking down, if one would, over the flood of the real, butmuch more occupied with the sight of the old Cambridge ghosts, whoseemed to advance one by one, even at that precarious eminence, to meetme. My small story would gain infinitely in richness if I were able toname them, but they swarmed all the while too thick, and of but two orthree of them alone is it true that they push their way, of themselves,through any silence. It was thus at any rate a questionas I have indeedalready sufficiently shownof what one read _into_ anything, not of whatone read out of it; and the occasions that operated for that mild magicresolve themselves now into three or four of an intrinsic colour so dimas to be otherwise well-nigh indistinguishable. Why, if one could tellit, would it be so wonderful, for instance, to have stood on the lowcliff that hangs over the Charles, by the nearer side of Mount Auburn,and felt the whole place bristle with merciless memories? It was late inthe autumn and in the dayalmost evening; with a wintry pink light inthe west, the special shade, fading into a heartless prettiness of grey,that shows with a polar chill through the grim tracery of November. Justopposite, at a distance, beyond the river and its meadows, the whiteface of the great empty Stadium stared at me, as blank as a risingmoonwith Soldiers Field squaring itself like some flat memorial slabthat waits to be inscribed. I had seen it inscribed a week or two beforein the fantastic lettering of a great intercollegiate game of football,and that impression had been so documentary, as to the capacity of theAmerican public for momentary gregarious emphasis, that I regret havingto omit here all the reflections it prompted.They were not, however, what was now relevant, save in so far as themany-mouthed uproar they recalled was a voice in the more multitudinousmodern hum through which one listened almost in vain for the sound ofthe old names. One of these in particular rose to my lipsit wasimpossible to stand there and not reach out a hand to J. R. L. as to aresponsive personal presence, the very genius of the spot, who had givenit from so early the direct literary consecration without which even themost charming seats of civilization go through life awkwardly andruefully, after the manner of unchristened children. They lack thus, forthe great occasions, the great formal necessities, their papers. Itwas thanks to Lowell even more immediately than to Longfellow thatCambridge _had_ its papersthough if I find myself putting that wordinto the past tense it is perhaps because of the irresistibleadmonition, too (proceeding so from a thousand local symptoms), thattitles embodied in literary form are less and less likely, in theHarvard air, to be asked for. That is clearly not the way the wind sets:we see the great University sit and look very hard, at blue horizons ofpossibility, across the high table-land of her future; but the light ofliterary desire is not perceptibly in her eye (nothing is more strikingthan the recent drop in her of any outward sign of literary curiosity);precisely for which reason it was, doubtless, in part, that the changedworld seemed reflected with a certain tragic intensity even in facesever so turned to cheerful lights as those of my two constructivecompanions.I had passed high, square, sad old Elmwood on the way to my cliff overthe Charles, and had wonderingly lingered a little about it. I hadpassed Mr. Longfellows immemorial, historical, admired residence, stillample and symmetrical and visibly tourist-haunted (the only detectedruffle of its noble calm); elements of the picture that had rekindledfor an hour the finer sensibility, the finer continuity and piety. Itwas because of these things, again, that I felt the invoked pair besideme presently turn away, as under a chill, from that too spectral (in itsown turn) stare of the Stadiumperceived as a portent of the more_roaring_, more reported and excursionized scene; and in particularseemed to see J. R. L.s robust humour yield to the recognition of theirony of fate, dear to every poet, in one of its most pointed forms.That humour had played of old, charmingly, over the thesis thatCambridge, Mass., was, taken altogether, the most inwardly civilized,most intimately humane, among the haunts of men; whereby it hadcommitted itself, this honest adventurer, to a patient joy in thedevelopment of the _genius loci_, and was therefore without provision,either of poetry or of prose, against the picture of proportions andrelations overwhelmingly readjusted. If the little old place, with itsaccessible ear, had been so brave, what was the matter with the big newone, going in, as it would itself say, for greater braveries still?Nothing, no doubt, but that the possession of an ear would be ceasing tocount as an advantage. In what produced form, for instance, if he hadbeen right, was now represented the love of letters of which he had beenso distinguished an example? If he had on the other hand _not_ beenrightwell, it would all be rather dreadful. Such, at all events, may bethe disconcertments of a revisiting spiritwhen he has happened torevisit too ingenious an old friend.The old friend moreover had meanwhile had, and in relation to thislarge loose fringe of the town, there so freely disposed, one of hisvery own disconcertments; he had turned his steps, for the pleasure ofmemory, to Fresh Pond, dear to the muses of youth, the Sundayafternoons of spring, and had to accept there his clearest visionperhaps of the new differences and indifferences. The little nestlinglake of other days had ceased to nestle; there was practically noFresh Pond any more, and I seemed somehow to see why the muses hadfled even as from the place at large. The light flutter of their robeshad surrounded far-away walks and talks: one could at this day, onprinted, on almost faded pages, give chapter and verse for the effect,audible on the Sunday afternoons, of their habit of murmurous hintedapproval. Other things had come by makeweight; the charming CountryClub on toward Watertown, all verandahs and golf-links andtennis-lawns, all tea and ices and self-consciousness; and there hadcome, thereabouts too, the large extension of the Park System, theadmirable commissioners roads that reach across the ruder countrysidelike the arms of carnivorous giants stretching over a tea-table ofblackberries and buns. But these things were in the eternal Americannote, the note of the gregarious, the concentric, and pervadedmoreover by the rustle of petticoats too distinguishable from anygarmenthem of the sacred nine. The desecrated, the destroyed resorthad favoured, save on rare feast-days, the single stroll, or at theworst the double, dedicated to shared literary secrets; which was whyI almost angrily missed, among the ruins, what I had mainly gone backto recoversome echo of the dreams of youth, the titles of tales, thecommunities of friendship, the sympathies and patiences, in fine, ofdear W. D. H.                                   II                           NEW YORK REVISITED                                   IThe single impression or particular vision most answering to thegreatness of the subject would have been, I think, a certain hour oflarge circumnavigation that I found prescribed, in the fulness of thespring, as the almost immediate crown of a return from the Far West. Ihad arrived at one of the transpontine stations of the PennsylvaniaRailroad; the question was of proceeding to Boston, for the occasion,without pushing through the terrible townwhy terrible, to my sense,in many ways, I shall presently explainand the easy and agreeableattainment of this great advantage was to embark on one of the mightiest(as appeared to me) of train-bearing barges and, descending the westernwaters, pass round the bottom of the city and remount the other currentto Harlem; all without losing touch of the Pullman that had brought mefrom Washington. This absence of the need of losing touch, this breadthof effect, as to the whole process, involved in the prompt floating ofthe huge concatenated cars not only without arrest or confusion, but asfor positive prodigal beguilement of the artless traveller, haddoubtless much to say to the ensuing state of mind, the happily-excitedand amused view of the great face of New York. The extent, the ease, theenergy, the quantity and number, all notes scattered about as if, in thewhole business and in the splendid light, nature and science werejoyously romping together, might have been taking on again, for theirsymbol, some collective presence of great circling and plunging,hovering and perching seabirds, white-winged images of the spirit, ofthe restless freedom of the Bay. The Bay had always, on otheropportunities, seemed to blow its immense character straight into onesfacecoming at you, so to speak, bearing down on you, with the fullforce of a thousand prows of steamers seen exactly on the line of theirlongitudinal axis; but I had never before been so conscious of itsboundless cool assurance or seemed to see its genius so grandly at play.This was presumably indeed because I had never before enjoyed theremarkable adventure of taking in so much of the vast bristlingpromontory from the water, of ascending the East River, in especial, toits upper diminishing expanses.Something of the air of the occasion and of the mood of the momentcaused the whole picture to speak with its largest suggestion; whichsuggestion is irresistible when once it is sounded clear. It is all,absolutely, an expression of things lately and currently _done_, done ona large impersonal stage and on the basis of inordinate gainit is notan expression of any other matters whatever; and yet the sense of thescene (which had at several previous junctures, as well, put forth to myimagination its power) was commanding and thrilling, was in certainlights almost charming. So it befell, exactly, that an element ofmystery and wonder entered into the impressionthe interest of trying tomake out, in the absence of features of the sort usually supposedindispensable, the reason of the beauty and the joy. It is indubitably agreat bay, a great harbour, but no one item of the romantic, or evenof the picturesque, as commonly understood, contributes to its effect.The shores are low and for the most part depressingly furnished andprosaically peopled; the islands, though numerous, have not a grace toexhibit, and one thinks of the other, the real flowers of geography inthis order, of Naples, of Capetown, of Sydney, of Seattle, of SanFrancisco, of Rio, asking how if _they_ justify a reputation, New Yorkshould seem to justify one. Then, after all, we remember that there arereputations and reputations; we remember above all that the imaginativeresponse to the conditions here presented may just happen to proceedfrom the intellectual extravagance of the given observer. When thispersonage is open to corruption by almost any large view of an intensityof life, his vibrations tend to become a matter difficult even for _him_to explain. He may have to confess that the group of evident facts failsto account by itself for the complacency of his appreciation. Thereforeit is that I find myself rather backward with a perceived sanction, ofan at all proportionate kind, for the fine exhilaration with which, inthis free wayfaring relation to them, the wide waters of New Yorkinspire me. There is the beauty of light and air, the great scale ofspace, and, seen far away to the west, the open gates of the Hudson,majestic in their degree, even at a distance, and announcing stillnobler things. But the real appeal, unmistakably, is in that note ofvehemence in the local life of which I have spoken, for it is the appealof a particular type of dauntless power.The aspect the power wears then is indescribable; it is the power ofthe most extravagant of cities, rejoicing, as with the voice of themorning, in its might, its fortune, its unsurpassable conditions, andimparting to every object and element, to the motion and expression ofevery floating, hurrying, panting thing, to the throb of ferries andtugs, to the plash of waves and the play of winds and the glint oflights and the shrill of whistles and the quality and authority ofbreeze-borne criesall, practically, a diffused, wasted clamour of_detonations_something of its sharp free accent and, above all, ofits sovereign sense of being backed and able to back. The universal_applied_ passion struck me as shining unprecedentedly out of thecomposition; in the bigness and bravery and insolence, especially, ofeverything that rushed and shrieked; in the air as of a greatintricate frenzied dance, half merry, half desperate, or at least halfdefiant, performed on the huge watery floor. This appearance of thebold lacing-together, across the waters, of the scattered members ofthe monstrous organismlacing as by the ceaseless play of an enormoussystem of steam-shuttles or electric bobbins (I scarce know what tocall them), commensurate in form with their infinite workdoes perhapsmore than anything else to give the pitch of the vision of energy. Onehas the sense that the monster grows and grows, flinging abroad itsloose limbs even as some unmannered young giant at his larks, andthat the binding stitches must for ever fly further and faster anddraw harder; the future complexity of the web, all under the sky andover the sea, becoming thus that of some colossal set of clockworks,some steel-souled machine-room of brandished arms and hammering fistsand opening and closing jaws. The immeasurable bridges are but as thehorizontal sheaths of pistons working at high pressure, day and night,and subject, one apprehends with perhaps inconsistent gloom, tocertain, to fantastic, to merciless multiplication. In the light ofthis apprehension indeed the breezy brightness of the Bay puts on thesemblance of the vast white page that awaits beyond any other perhapsthe black overscoring of science.Let me hasten to add that its present whiteness is precisely itscharming note, the frankest of the signs you recognize and remember itby. That is the distinction I was just feeling my way to name as themain ground of its doing so well, for effect, without technical scenery.There are great imposing portsGlasgow and Liverpool and Londonthathave already their page blackened almost beyond redemption from any suchlight of the picturesque as can hope to irradiate fog and grime, andthere are others, Marseilles and Constantinople say, or, for all I knowto the contrary, New Orleans, that contrive to abound before everythingelse in colour, and so to make a rich and instant and obvious show. Butmemory and the actual impression keep investing New York with the tone,predominantly, of summer dawns and winter frosts, of sea-foam, ofbleached sails and stretched awnings, of blanched hulls, of scoureddecks, of new ropes, of polished brasses, of streamers clear in the blueair; and it is by this harmony, doubtless, that the projection of theindividual character of the place, of the candour of its avidity and thefreshness of its audacity, is most conveyed. The tall buildings, whichhave so promptly usurped a glory that affects you as rather surprised,as yet, at itself, the multitudinous sky-scrapers standing up to theview, from the water, like extravagant pins in a cushion alreadyoverplanted, and stuck in as in the dark, anywhere and anyhow, have atleast the felicity of carrying out the fairness of tone, of taking thesun and the shade in the manner of towers of marble. They are not all ofmarble, I believe, by any means, even if some may be, but they areimpudently new and still more impudently novelthis in common with somany other terrible things in Americaand they are triumphant payers ofdividends; all of which uncontested and unabashed pride, with flash ofinnumerable windows and flicker of subordinate gilt attributions, islike the flare, up and down their long, narrow faces, of the lamps ofsome general permanent celebration.You see the pin-cushion in profile, so to speak, on passing betweenJersey City and Twenty-third Street, but you get it broadside on, thisloose nosegay of architectural flowers, if you skirt the Battery, wellout, and embrace the whole plantation. Then the American beauty, therose of interminable stem, becomes the token of the cluster at largetothat degree that, positively, this is all that is wanted for emphasis ofyour final impression. Such growths, you feel, have confessedly arisenbut to be picked, in time, with a shears; nipped short off, by waitingfate, as soon as science, applied to gain, has put upon the table,from far up its sleeve, some more winning card. Crowned not only with nohistory, but with no credible possibility of time for history, andconsecrated by no uses save the commercial at any cost, they are simplythe most piercing notes in that concert of the expensively provisionalinto which your supreme sense of New York resolves itself. They neverbegin to speak to you, in the manner of the builded majesties of theworld as we have heretofore known suchtowers or temples or fortressesor palaceswith the authority of things of permanence or even of thingsof long duration. One story is good only till another is told, andsky-scrapers are the last word of economic ingenuity only till anotherword be written. This shall be possibly a word of still uglier meaning,but the vocabulary of thrift at any price shows boundless resources, andthe consciousness of that truth, the consciousness of the finite, themenaced, the essentially _invented_ state, twinkles ever, to myperception, in the thousand glassy eyes of these giants of the meremarket. Such a structure as the comparatively windowless bell-tower ofGiotto, in Florence, looks supremely serene in its beauty. You dontfeel it to have risen by the breath of an interested passion that,restless beyond all passions, is for ever seeking more pliable forms.Beauty has been the object of its creators idea, and, having foundbeauty, it has found the form in which it splendidly rests.Beauty indeed was the aim of the creator of the spire of Trinity Church,so cruelly overtopped and so barely distinguishable, from yourtrain-bearing barge, as you stand off, in its abject helpless humility;and it may of course be asked how much of this superstition finds voicein the actual shrunken presence of that laudable effort. Where, for theeye, is the felicity of simplified Gothic, of noble pre-eminence, thatonce made of this highly-pleasing edifice the pride of the town and thefeature of Broadway? The answer is, as obviously, that these charmingelements are still there, just where they ever were, but that they havebeen mercilessly deprived of their visibility. It aches and throbs, thissmothered visibility, we easily feel, in its caged and dishonouredcondition, supported only by the consciousness that the dishonour is nofault of its own. We commune with it, in tenderness and pity, throughthe encumbered air; our eyes, made, however unwillingly, at home instrange vertiginous upper atmospheres, look down on it as on a poorineffectual thing, an architectural object addressed, even in its primeaspiration, to the patient pedestrian sense and permitting thereby arelation of intimacy. It was to speak to me audibly enough on two orthree other occasionseven through the thick of that frenzy of Broadwayjust where Broadway receives from Wall Street the fiercest applicationof the maddening lash; it was to put its tragic case there withirresistible lucidity. Yes, the wretched figure I am making is aslittle as you see my faultit is the fault of the buildings whose veryfirst care is to deprive churches of their visibility. There are but twoor threetwo or three outward and visible churchesleft in New Yorkanyway, as you must have noticed, and even they are hideouslythreatened: a fact at which no one, indeed, appears to be shocked, fromwhich no one draws the least of the inferences that stick straight outof it, which every one seems in short to take for granted either withremarkable stupidity or with remarkable cynicism. So, at any rate, theymay still effectively communicate, ruddy-brown (where not browny-black)old Trinity and any pausing, any attending survivor of the clearerageand there is yet more of the bitterness of history to be tasted insuch a tacit passage, as I shall presently show.Was it not the bitterness of history, meanwhile, that on that day ofcircumnavigation, that day of highest intensity of impression, of whichI began by speaking, the ancient rotunda of Castle Garden, viewed fromjust opposite, should have lurked there as a vague nonentity? One hadknown it from far, far back and with the indelibility of the childishvisionfrom the time when it was the commodious concert-hall of NewYork, the firmament of long-extinguished stars; in spite of whichextinction there outlives for me the image of the infant phenomenonAdelina Patti, whom (another large-eyed infant) I had been benevolentlytaken to hear: Adelina Patti, in a fan-like little white frock andpantalettes and a hussar-like red jacket, mounted on an armchair, itsback supporting her, wheeled to the front of the stage and warbling likea tiny thrush even in the nest. Shabby, shrunken, barely discernibleto-day, the ancient rotunda, adjusted to other uses, had afterwards, formany decades, carried on a conspicuous lifeand it was the presentremoteness, the repudiated barbarism of all this, foreshortened by onesown experience, that dropped the acid into the cup. The sky-scrapers andthe league-long bridges, present and to come, marked the point where theagethe age for which Castle Garden could have been, in its day, avaluehad come out. That in itself was nothingages do come out, as amatter of course, so far from where they have gone in. But it had doneso, the latter half of the nineteenth century, in ones own more or lessimmediate presence; the difference, from pole to pole, was so vivid andconcrete that no single shade of any one of its aspects was lost. Thisimpact of the whole condensed past at once produced a horrible, hatefulsense of personal antiquity.Yet was it after all that those monsters of the mere market, as I havecalled them, had more to say, on the question of effect, than I had atfirst allowed?since they are the element that looms largest for methrough a particular impression, with remembered parts and piecesmelting together rather richly now, of down-town seen and felt fromthe inside. FeltI use that word, I dare say, all presumptuously, fora relation to matters of magnitude and mystery that I could beginneither to measure nor to penetrate, hovering about them only inmagnanimous wonder, staring at them as at a world of immovably-closeddoors behind which immense material lurked, material for the artist,the painter of life, as we say, who shouldnt have begun so early and sofatally to fall away from possible initiations. This sense of a baffledcuriosity, an intellectual adventure forever renounced, was surelyenough a state of feeling, and indeed in presence of the differenthalf-hours, as memory presents them, at which I gave myself up both tothe thrill of Wall Street (by which I mean that of the whole wide edgeof the whirlpool), and the too accepted, too irredeemable ignorance, Iam at a loss to see what intensity of response was wanting. Theimagination might have responded more if there had been a slightly lesssettled inability to understand what every one, what any one, was reallydoing; but the picture, as it comes back to me, is, for all this foolishsubjective poverty, so crowded with its features that I rejoice, Iconfess, in not having more of them to handle. No open apprehension,even if it be as open as a public vehicle plying for hire, can carrymore than a certain amount of life, of a kind; and there was nothing atplay in the outer air, at least, of the scene, during these glimpses,that didnt scramble for admission into mine very much as I had seen themob seeking entrance to an up-town or a down-town electric car fight forlife at one of the apertures. If it had been the final function of theBay to make one feel ones age, so, assuredly, the mouth of Wall Streetproclaimed it, for ones private ear, distinctly enough; the breath ofexistence being taken, wherever one turned, as that of youth on the runand with the prize of the race in sight, and the new landmarks crushingthe old quite as violent children stamp on snails and caterpillars.The hour I first recall was a morning of winter drizzle and mist, ofdense fog in the Bay, one of the strangest sights of which I was on myway to enjoy; and I had stopped in the heart of the business quarter topick up a friend who was to be my companion. The weather, such as itwas, worked wonders for the upper reaches of the buildings, round whichit drifted and hung very much as about the flanks and summits ofemergent mountainmassesfor, to be just all round, there _was_ someevidence of their having a message for the eyes. Let me parenthesize,once for all, that there are other glimpses of this message, up and downthe city, frequently to be caught; lights and shades of winter andsummer air, of the literally finishing afternoon in particular, whenrefinement of modelling descends from the skies and lends the whitetowers, all new and crude and commercial and over-windowed as they are,a fleeting distinction. The morning I speak of offered me my firstchance of seeing one of them from the insidewhich was an opportunity Isought again, repeatedly, in respect to others; and I became consciousof the force with which this vision of their prodigious working, and ofthe multitudinous life, as if each were a swarming city in itself, thatthey are capable of housing, may beget, on the part of the freeobserver, in other words of the restless analyst, the impulse todescribe and present the facts and express the sense of them. Each ofthese huge constructed and compressed communities, throbbing, throughits myriad arteries and pores, with a single passion, even as acomplicated watch throbs with the one purpose of telling you the hourand the minute, testified overwhelmingly to the _character_ of NewYorkand the passion of the restless analyst, on his side, is for theextraction of character. But there would be too much to say, just here,were this incurable eccentric to let himself go; the impression inquestion, fed by however brief an experience, kept overflowing the cupand spreading in a wide waste of speculation. I must dip into thesedepths, if it prove possible, later on; let me content myself for themoment with remembering how from the first, on all such ground, mythought went straight to poor great wonder-working mile Zola and _his_love of the human aggregation, the artificial microcosm, which had tospend itself on great shops, great businesses, great apartment-houses,of inferior, of mere Parisian scale. His image, it seemed to me, reallyasked for compassionin the presence of this material that his energy ofevocation, his alone, would have been of a stature to meddle with. Whatif _Le Ventre de Paris_, what if _Au Bonheur des Dames_, what if_Pot-Bouille_ and _LArgent_, could but have come into being under theNew York inspiration?The answer to that, however, for the hour, was that, in all probability,New York was not going (as it turns such remarks) to produce both themaximum of business spectacle and the maximum of ironic reflection ofit. Zolas huge reflector got itself formed, after all, in a far otherair; it had hung there, in essence, awaiting the scene that was to playover it, long before the scene really approached it in scale. Thereflecting surfaces, of the ironic, of the epic order, suspended in theNew York atmosphere, have yet to show symptoms of shining out, and themonstrous phenomena themselves, meanwhile, strike me as having, withtheir immense momentum, got the start, got ahead of, in proper parlance,any possibility of poetic, of dramatic capture. That conviction came tome most perhaps while I gazed across at the special sky-scraper thatoverhangs poor old Trinity to the northa south face as high and wide asthe mountain-wall that drops the Alpine avalanche, from time to time,upon the village, and the village spire, at its foot; the interest ofthis case being above all, as I learned, to my stupefaction, in the factthat the very creators of the extinguisher are the churchwardensthemselves, or at least the trustees of the church property. What wasthe case but magnificent for pitiless ferocity?that inexorable law ofthe growing invisibility of churches, their everywhere reduced orabolished _presence_, which is nine-tenths of their virtue, receivingthus, at such hands, its supreme consecration. This consecration waspositively the greater that just then, as I have said, the vastmoney-making structure quite horribly, quite romantically justifieditself, looming through the weather with an insolent cliff-likesublimity. The weather, for all that experience, mixes intimately withthe fulness of my impression; speaking not least, for instance, of theway the state of the streets and the assault of the turbid air seemedall one with the look, the tramp, the whole quality and _allure_, theconsummate monotonous commonness, of the pushing male crowd, moving inits dense masswith the confusion carried to chaos for any intelligence,any perception; a welter of objects and sounds in which relief,detachment, dignity, meaning, perished utterly and lost all rights. Itappeared, the muddy medium, all one with every other element and note aswell, all the signs of the heaped industrial battle-field, all thesounds and silences, grim, pushing, trudging silences too, of theuniversal will to moveto move, move, move, as an end in itself, anappetite at any price.In the Bay, the rest of the morning, the dense raw fog that delayed thebig boat, allowing sight but of the immediate ice-masses through whichit thumped its way, was not less of the essence. Anything blander, as amedium, would have seemed a mockery of the facts of the terrible littleEllis Island, the first harbour of refuge and stage of patience for themillion or so of immigrants annually knocking at our official door.Before this door, which opens to them there only with a hundred formsand ceremonies, grindings and grumblings of the key, they standappealing and waiting, marshalled, herded, divided, subdivided, sorted,sifted, searched, fumigated, for longer or shorter periodsthe effect ofall which prodigious process, an intendedly scientific feeding of themill, is again to give the earnest observer a thousand more things tothink of than he can pretend to retail. The impression of Ellis Island,in fine, would beas I was to find throughout that so many of myimpressions would bea chapter by itself; and with a particular page forrecognition of the degree in which the liberal hospitality of theeminent Commissioner of this wonderful service, to whom I had beenintroduced, helped to make the interest of the whole watched dramapoignant and unforgettable. It is a drama that goes on, without a pause,day by day and year by year, this visible act of ingurgitation on thepart of our body politic and social, and constituting really an appealto amazement beyond that of any sword-swallowing or fire-swallowing ofthe circus. The wonder that one couldnt keep down was the thought thatthese two or three hours of ones own chance vision of the business werebut as a tick or two of the mighty clock, the clock that never, neverstopsleast of all when it strikes, for a sign of so much winding-up,some louder hour of our national fate than usual. I think indeed thatthe simplest account of the action of Ellis Island on the spirit of anysensitive citizen who may have happened to look in is that he comesback from his visit not at all the same person that he went. He haseaten of the tree of knowledge, and the taste will be for ever in hismouth. He had thought he knew before, thought he had the sense of thedegree in which it is his American fate to share the sanctity of hisAmerican consciousness, the intimacy of his American patriotism, withthe inconceivable alien; but the truth had never come home to him withany such force. In the lurid light projected upon it by those courts ofdismay it shakes himor I like at least to imagine it shakes himto thedepths of his being; I like to think of him, I positively _have_ tothink of him, as going about ever afterwards with a new look, for thosewho can see it, in his face, the outward sign of the new chill in hisheart. So is stamped, for detection, the questionably privileged personwho has had an apparition, seen a ghost in his supposedly safe oldhouse. Let not the unwary, therefore, visit Ellis Island.The after-sense of that acute experience, however, I myself found, wasby no means to be brushed away; I felt it grow and grow, on thecontrary, wherever I turned: other impressions might come and go, butthis affirmed claim of the alien, however immeasurably alien, to sharein ones supreme relation was everywhere the fixed element, the remindernot to be dodged. Ones supreme relation, as one had always put it, wasones relation to ones countrya conception made up so largely of onescountrymen and ones countrywomen. Thus it was as if, all the while,with such a fond tradition of what these products predominantly were,the idea of the country itself underwent something of that profaneoverhauling through which it appears to suffer the indignity of change.Is not our instinct in this matter, in general, essentially the safeonethat of keeping the idea simple and strong and continuous, so thatit shall be perfectly sound? To touch it overmuch, to pull it about, isto put it in peril of weakening; yet on this free assault upon it, thisreadjustment of it in _their_ monstrous, presumptuous interest, thealiens, in New York, seemed perpetually to insist. The combination thereof their quantity and their qualitythat loud primary stage of alienismwhich New York most offers to sightoperates, for the native, as theirnote of settled possession, something they have nobody to thank for; sothat _un_settled possession is what we, on our side, seem reduced totheimplication of which, in its turn, is that, to recover confidence andregain lost ground, we, not they, must make the surrender and accept theorientation. We must go, in other words, _more_ than half-way to meetthem; which is all the difference, for us, between possession anddispossession. This sense of dispossession, to be brief about it,haunted me so, I was to feel, in the New York streets and in the packedtrajectiles to which one clingingly appeals from the streets, just asone tumbles back into the streets in appalled reaction from _them_, thatthe art of beguiling or duping it became an art to be cultivatedthoughthe fond alternative vision was never long to be obscured, theimagination, exasperated to envy, of the ideal, in the order inquestion; of the luxury of some such close and sweet and _whole_national consciousness as that of the Switzer and the Scot.                                   IIMy recovery of impressions, after a short interval, yet with their flusha little faded, may have been judged to involve itself with excursionsof memorymemory directed to the antecedent timereckless almost toextravagance. But I recall them to-day, none the less, for that value inthem which ministered, at happy moments, to an artful evasion of theactual. There was no escape from the ubiquitous alien into the future,or even into the present; there was an escape but into the past. I countas quite a triumph in this interest an unbroken ease of frequentation ofthat ancient end of Fifth Avenue to the whole neighbourhood of whichones earlier vibrations, a very far-away matter now, were attuned. Theprecious stretch of space between Washington Square and FourteenthStreet had a value, had even a charm, for the revisiting spirita mildand melancholy glamour which I am conscious of the difficulty ofrendering for new and heedless generations. Here again the assault ofsuggestion is too great; too large, I mean, the number of hares started,before the pursuing imagination, the quickened memory, by this fact ofthe felt moral and social value of this comparatively unimpaired morselof the Fifth Avenue heritage. Its reference to a pleasanter, easier,hazier past is absolutely comparative, just as the past in questionitself enjoys as such the merest courtesy-title. It is all recenthistory enough, by the measure of the whole, and there are flaws anddefacements enough, surely, even in its appearance of decency ofduration. The tall building, grossly tall and grossly ugly, has failedof an admirable chance of distinguished consideration for it, and thedignity of many of its peaceful fronts has succumbed to the presence ofthose industries whose foremost need is to make a good thing of them.The good thing is doubtless being made, and yet this lower end of theonce agreeable street still just escapes being a wholly bad thing. Whatheld the fancy in thrall, however, as I say, was the admonition,proceeding from all the facts, that values of this romantic order are atbest, anywhere, strangely relative. It was an extraordinary statement onthe subject of New York that the space between Fourteenth Street andWashington Square _should_ count for tone, figure as the old ivory ofan overscored tablet.True wisdom, I found, was to let it, to make it, so count and figure asmuch as it would, and charming assistance came for this, I also found,from the young good-nature of May and June. There had been neitherassistance nor good-nature during the grim weeks of mid-winter; therehad been but the meagre fact of a discomfort and an ugliness lessformidable here than elsewhere. When, toward the top of the town,circulation, alimentation, recreation, every art of existence, gave waybefore the full onset of winter, when the upper avenues had become as somany congested bottle-necks, through which the wine of life simplyrefused to be decanted, getting back to these latitudes resembled reallya return from the North Pole to the Temperate Zone: it was as if thewine of life had been poured for you, in advance, into some pleasant oldpunch-bowl that would support you through the temporary stress. Yourcondition was not reduced to the endless vista of a clogged tube, of athoroughfare occupied as to the narrow central ridge with trolley-carsstuffed to suffocation, and as to the mere margin, on either side, withsnow-banks resulting from the cleared rails and offering themselves as afield for all remaining action. Free existence and good manners, in NewYork, are too much brought down to a bare rigour of marginal relation tothe endless electric coil, the monstrous chain that winds round thegeneral neck and body, the general middle and legs, very much as theboa-constrictor winds round the group of the Laocoon. It struck me thatwhen these folds are tightened in the terrible stricture of thesnow-smothered months of the year, the New York predicament leaves farbehind the anguish represented in the Vatican figures. To come and gowhere East Eleventh Street, where West Tenth, opened their kind shortarms was at least to keep clear of the awful hug of the serpent. Andthis was a grace that grew large, as I have hinted, with the approach ofsummer, and that made in the afternoons of May and of the first half ofJune, above all, an insidious appeal. There, I repeat, was the delicacy,there the mystery, there the wonder, in especial, of the unquenchableintensity of the impressions received in childhood. They are made thenonce for all, be their intrinsic beauty, interest, importance, small orgreat; the stamp is indelible and never wholly fades. This in fact givesit an importance when a lifetime has intervened. I found myselfintimately recognizing every house my officious tenth year had, in theway of imagined adventure, introduced to meincomparable master ofceremonies after all; the privilege had been offered since to millionsof other objects that had made nothing of it, that had gone as theycame; so that here were Fifth Avenue corners with which ones connectionwas fairly exquisite. The lowered light of the days ends of earlysummer became them, moreover, exceedingly, and they fell, for the quietnorthward perspective, into a dozen delicacies of composition and tone.One could talk of quietness now, for the shrinkage of life so marked,in the higher latitudes of the town, after Easter, the visible earlyflight of that society which, by the old custom, used never to budgebefore June or July, had almost the effect of clearing some of thestreets, and indeed of suggesting that a truly clear New York might havean unsuspected charm or two to put forth. An approach to peace andharmony might have been, in a manner, promised, and the sense of otherdays took advantage of it to steal abroad with a ghostly tread. It keptmeeting, half the time, to its discomfiture, the lamentable little Archof Triumph which bestrides these beginnings of WashingtonSquarelamentable because of its poor and lonely and unsupported andunaffiliated state. With this melancholy monument it could make no termsat all, but turned its back to the strange sight as often as possible,helping itself thereby, moreover, to do a little of the pretendingrequired, no doubt, by the fond theory that nothing hereabouts waschanged. Nothing _was_, it could occasionally appear to methere was nonew note in the picture, not one, for instance, when I paused before alow house in a small row on the south side of Waverley Place and livedagain into the queer medival costume (preserved by thedaguerreotypists art) of the very little boy for whom the scene hadonce embodied the pangs and pleasures of a dames small school. The damemust have been Irish, by her name, and the Irish tradition, onlyintensified and coarsened, seemed still to possess the place, the factof the survival, the sturdy sameness, of which arrested me, again andagain, to fascination. The shabby red house, with its mere two storeys,its lowly stoop, its dislocated ironwork of the forties, the earlyfifties, the record, in its face, of blistering summers and of the longstages of the loss of self-respect, made it as consummate a morsel ofthe old liquor-scented, heated-looking city, the city of no pavements,but of such a plenty of politics, as I could have desired. Andneighbouring Sixth Avenue, overstraddled though it might be with featsof engineering unknown to the primitive age that otherwise so persisted,wanted only, to carry off the illusion, the warm smell of the bakery onthe corner of Eighth Street, a blessed repository of doughnuts, cookies,cream-cakes and pies, the slow passing by which, on returns from school,must have had much in common with the experience of the shipmen of oldwho came, in long voyages, while they tacked and hung back, upon thosebelts of ocean that are haunted with the balm and spice of tropicislands.These were the felicities of the backward reach, which, however, hadalso its melancholy checks and snubs; nowhere quite so sharp as inpresence, so to speak, of the rudely, the ruthlessly suppressedbirth-house on the other side of the Square. That was where the pretencethat nearly nothing was changed had most to come in; for a high, square,impersonal structure, proclaiming its lack of interest with a crudityall its own, so blocks, at the right moment for its own success, theview of the past, that the effect for me, in Washington Place, was ofhaving been amputated of half my history. The grey and more or lesshallowed University buildingwasnt it somehow, with a desperatebravery, both castellated and gabled?has vanished from the earth, andvanished with it the two or three adjacent houses, of which thebirthplace was one. This was the snub, for the complacency ofretrospect, that, whereas the inner sense had positively erected therefor its private contemplation a commemorative mural tablet, the verywall that should have borne this inscription had been smashed as fordemonstration that tablets, in New York, are unthinkable. And I have hadindeed to permit myself this free fantasy of the hypothetic rescuedidentity of a given housetaking the vanished number in Washington Placeas most pertinentin order to invite the reader to gasp properly with mebefore the fact that we not only fail to remember, in the whole lengthof the city, one of these frontal records of birth, sojourn, or death,under a celebrated name, but that we have only to reflect an instant tosee any such form of civic piety inevitably and for ever absent. Theform is cultivated, to the greatly quickened interest of street-scenery,in many of the cities of Europe; and is it not verily bitter, for thosewho feel a poetry in the noted passage, longer or shorter, here andthere, of great lost spirits, that the institution, the profit, theglory of any such association is denied in advance to communitiestending, as the phrase is, to run preponderantly to the sky-scraper?Where, in fact, is the point of inserting a mural tablet, at any legibleheight, in a building certain to be destroyed to make room for asky-scraper? And from where, on the other hand, in a faade of fiftyfloors, does one see the pious plate recording the honour attached toone of the apartments look down on a responsive people? We have but toask the question to recognize our necessary failure to answer it as asupremely characteristic local notea note in the light of which thegreat city is projected into its future as, practically, a huge,continuous fifty-floored conspiracy against the very idea of the ancientgraces, those that strike us as having flourished just in proportion asthe parts of life and the signs of character have _not_ been lumpedtogether, not been indistinguishably sunk in the common fund of mereeconomic convenience. So interesting, as object-lessons, may thedevelopments of the American gregarious ideal become; so traceable, atevery turn, to the restless analyst at least, are the heavy footprints,in the finer texture of life, of a great commercial democracy seeking toabound supremely in its own sense and having none to gainsay it.Let me not, however, forget, amid such contemplations, what may servehere as a much more relevant instance of the operation of values, theprice of the as yet undiminished dignity of the two most southward ofthe Fifth Avenue churches. Half the charm of the prospect, at thatextremity, is in their still being there, and being as they are; thischarm, this serenity of escape and survival positively works as a blindon the side of the question of their architectural importance. The lastshade of pedantry or priggishness drops from your view of that element;they illustrate again supremely your grasped truth of the _comparative_character, in such conditions, of beauty and of interest. The specialstandard they may or may not square with signifies, you feel, not a jot:all you know, and want to know, is that they are probably menacedsomehorrible voice of the air has murmured itand that with them will go, iffate overtakes them, the last cases worth mentioning (with a singleexception), of the modest felicity that sometimes used to be. Remarkablecertainly the state of things in which mere exemption from thesquashed condition can shed such a glamour; but we may accept thestate of things if only we can keep the glamour undispelled. It reachedits maximum for me, I hasten to add, on my penetrating into theAscension, at chosen noon, and standing for the first time in presenceof that noble work of John La Farge, the representation, on the westwall, in the grand manner, of the theological event from which thechurch takes its title. Wonderful enough, in New York, to find onesself, in a charming and considerably dim old church, hushed toadmiration before a great religious picture; the sensation, for themoment, upset so all the facts. The hot light, outside, might have beenthat of an Italian _piazzetta_; the cool shade, within, with theimportant work of art shining through it, seemed part of someother-world pilgrimageall the more that the important work of artitself, a thing of the highest distinction, spoke, as soon as one hadtaken it in, with that authority which makes the difference, everafterwards, between the remembered and the forgotten quest. A rich noteof interference came, I admit, through the splendid window-glass, thefinest of which, unsurpassably fine, to my sense, is the work of thesame artist; so that the church, as it stands, is very nearly ascommemorative a monument as a great reputation need wish. The deeplypictorial windows, in which clearness of picture and fulness ofexpression consort so successfully with a tone as of magnified gems, didnot strike one as looking into a yellow little square of the souththeyput forth a different implication; but the flaw in the harmony was, morethan anything else, that sinister voice of the air of which I havespoken, the fact that one _could_ stand there, vibrating to suchimpressions, only to remember the suspended danger, the possibility ofthe doom. Here was the loveliest cluster of images, begotten on thespot, that the preoccupied city had ever taken thought to offer itself;and here, to match them, like some black shadow they had been condemnedto cast, was this particular prepared honour of removal that appearedto hover about them.Ones fear, I repeat, was perhaps misplacedbut what an air to live in,the shuddering pilgrim mused, the air in which such fears are notmisplaced only when we are conscious of very special reassurances! Thevision of the doom that does descend, that had descended all round, wasat all events, for the half-hour, all that was wanted to charge with thelast tenderness ones memory of the transfigured interior. Afterwards,outside, again and again, the powers of removal struck me as looming,awfully, in the newest mass of multiplied floors and windows visible atthis point. _They_, ranged in this terrible recent erection, were goingto bring in moneyand was not money the only thing a self-respectingstructure could be thought of as bringing in? Hadnt one heard, justbefore, in Boston, that the security, that the sweet serenity of thePark Street Church, charmingest, there, of aboriginal notes, the verylight, with its perfect position and its dear old delightful Wren-likespire, of the starved citys eyes, had been artfully practised against,and that the question of saving it might become, in the near future,acute? Nothing, fortunately, I think, is so much the making of NewYork, at its central point, for the visual, almost for the romantic,sense, as the Park Street Church is the making, by its happy coming-in,of Boston; and, therefore, if it were thinkable that the peculiarrectitude of Boston might be laid in the dust, what mightnt easily comeabout for the reputedly less austere conscience of New York? Once suchquestions had obtained lodgment, to take ones walks was verily to lookat almost everything in their light; and to commune with the sky-scraperunder this influence was really to feel worsted, more and more, in anymagnanimous attempt to adopt the sthetic view of it. I may appear tomake too much of these invidious presences, but it must be rememberedthat they represent, for our time, the only claim to any considerationother than merely statistical established by the resounding growth ofNew York. The attempt to take the sthetic view is invariably blightedsooner or later by their most salient characteristic, _the_ feature thatspeaks loudest for the economic idea. Window upon window, at any cost,is a condition never to be reconciled with any grace of building, andthe logic of the matter here happens to put on a particularly fatalfront. If quiet interspaces, always half the architectural battle, existno more in such a structural scheme than quiet tones, blestbreathing-spaces, occur, for the most part, in New York conversation, sothe reason is, demonstrably, that the building cant afford them. (It isby very much the same law, one supposes, that New York conversationcannot afford stops.) The building can only afford lights, each lighthaving a superlative value as an aid to the transaction of business andthe conclusion of sharp bargains. Doesnt it take in fact acres ofwindow-glass to help even an expert New Yorker to get the better ofanother expert one, or to see that the other expert one doesnt get thebetter of _him_? It is easy to conceive that, after all, with thisorigin and nature stamped upon their foreheads, the last word of themercenary monsters should not be their address to our sense of formalbeauty.Still, as I have already hinted, there was always the case of the oneother rescued identity and preserved felicity, the happy accident of theelder day still ungrudged and finally legitimated. When I say ungrudged,indeed, I seem to remember how I had heard that the divine little CityHall had _been_ grudged, at a critical moment, to within an inch of itslife; had but just escaped, in the event, the extremity of grudging. Itlives on securely, by the mercy of fatelives on in the delicacy of itsbeauty, speaking volumes again (more volumes, distinctly, than areanywhere else spoken) for the exquisite truth of the _conferred_ valueof interesting objects, the value derived from the social, thecivilizing function for which they have happened to find theiropportunity. It is the opportunity that gives them their price, and theluck of there being, round about them, nothing greater than themselvesto steal it away from them. They strike thus, virtually, the supremenote, andsuch is the mysterious play of our finer sensibility!onetakes this note, one is glad to work it, as the phrase goes, for all itis worth. I so work the note of the City Hall, no doubt, in speaking ofthe spectacle there constituted as divine; but I do it precisely byreason of the spectacle taken _with_ the delightful small facts of thebuilding: largely by reason, in other words, of the elegant, the gallantlittle structures situation and history, the way it has played,artistically, ornamentally, its part, has held out for the good cause,through the long years, alone and unprotected. The fact is it has beenthe very centre of that assault of vulgarity of which the innumerablemementos rise within view of it and tower, at a certain distance, overit; and yet it has never parted with a square inch of its character, ithas forced them, in a manner, to stand off. I hasten to add that inexpressing thus its uncompromised state I speak of its outward, itssthetic character only. So, at all events, it has discharged thecivilizing function I just named as inherent in such casesthat ofrepresenting, to the community possessed of it, all the Style thecommunity is likely to get, and of making itself responsible for thesame.The consistency of this effort, under difficulties, has been the storythat brings tears to the eyes of the hovering kindly critic, and it isthrough his tears, no doubt, that such a personage reads the bestpassages of the tale and makes out the proportions of the object. Mine,I recognize, didnt prevent my seeing that the pale yellow marble (orwhatever it may be) of the City Hall has lost, by some late excoriation,the remembered charm of its old surface, the pleasant promiscuous patinaof time; but the perfect taste and finish, the reduced yet ample scale,the harmony of parts, the just proportions, the modest classic grace,the living look of the type aimed at, these things, with gaiety ofdetail undiminished and quaintness of effect augmented, are all there;and I see them, as I write, in that glow of appreciation which made itnecessary, of a fine June morning, that I should somehow pay the wholeplace my respects. The simplest, in fact the only way, was, obviously,to pass under the charming portico and brave the consequences: thisimpunity of such audacities being, in America, one of the last of thelessons the repatriated absentee finds himself learning. The crushedspirit he brings back from European discipline never quite rises to theheight of the native argument, the brave sense that the public, thecivic building is his very own, for any honest use, so that he may treadeven its most expensive pavements and staircases (and very expensive,for the American citizen, these have lately become,) without a questionasked. This further and further unchallenged penetration begets in theperverted person I speak of a really romantic thrill: it is like someassault of the dim seraglio, with the guards bribed, the eunuchs druggedand ones life carried in ones hand. The only drawback to such freedomis that penetralia it is so easy to penetrate fail a little of a dueimpressiveness, and that if stationed sentinels are bad for the temperof the freeman they are good for the prestige of the building.Never, in any case, it seemed to me, had any freeman made so free withthe majesty of things as I was to make on this occasion with themysteries of the City Halleven to the point of coming out into thepresence of the Representative of the highest office with which CityHalls are associated, and whose thoroughly gracious condonation of myact set the seal of success upon the whole adventure. Its dizziestintensity in fact sprang precisely from the unexpected view opened intothe old official, the old so thick-peopled local, municipal world: upperchambers of council and state, delightfully of their nineteenth-centurytime, as to design and ornament, in spite of rank restoration; butreplete, above all, with portraits of past worthies, past celebritiesand city fathers, Mayors, Bosses, Presidents, Governors, Statesmen atlarge, Generals and Commodores at large, florid ghosts, looking sounsophisticated now, of years not remarkable, municipally, for theabsence of sophistication. Here were types, running mainly to uglinessand all bristling with the taste of their day and the quite touchingprovincialism of their conditions, as to many of which nothing would bemore interesting than a study of New York annals in the light of theirpersonal look, their very noses and mouths and complexions and heads ofhairto say nothing of their waistcoats and neckties; with such colour,such sound and movement would the thick stream of local history then beinterfused. Wouldnt its thickness fairly become transparent? since towalk through the collection was not only to see and feel so much thathad happened, but to understand, with the truth again and againinimitably pointed, why nothing could have happened otherwise; the wholearray thus presenting itself as an unsurpassed demonstration of the realreasons of things. The florid ghosts look out from their exceedinglygilded framesall that _that_ can do is bravely done for themwith thefrankest responsibility for everything; their collective presencebecomes a kind of copious tell-tale document signed with a hundrednames. There are few of these that at this hour, I think, weparticularly desire to repeat; but the place where they may be read is,all the way from river to river and from the Battery to Harlem, theplace in which there is most of the terrible town.                                  IIIIf the Bay had seemed to me, as I have noted, most to help the fondobserver of New York aspects to a sense, through the eyes, of embracingpossession, so the part played there for the outward view found itsmatch for the inward in the portentous impression of one of the greatcaravansaries administered to me of a winter afternoon. I say withintention administered: on so assiduous a guide, through the endlesslabyrinth of the Waldorf-Astoria was I happily to chance after turningout of the early dusk and the January sleet and slosh into permitted,into enlightened contemplation of a pandemonium not less admirablyordered, to all appearance, than rarely intermitted. The seer of greatcities is liable to easy error, I know, when he finds this, that or theother caught glimpse the supremely significant oneand I am willing topreface with that remark my confession that New York told me more of herstory at once, then and there, than she was again and elsewhere to tell.With this apprehension that she was in fact fairly shrieking it intoones ears came a curiosity, corresponding, as to its kind and itsdegree of interest; so that there was nought to do, as we picked ourtortuous way, but to stare with all our eyes and miss as little aspossible of the revelation. That harshness of the essential conditions,the outward, which almost any large attempt at the amenities, in NewYork, has to take account of and make the best of, has at least theeffect of projecting the visitor with force upon the spectacle preparedfor him at this particular point and of marking the more its sudden highpitch, the character of violence which all its warmth, its colour andglitter so completely muffle. There is violence outside, mitigatingsadly the frontal majesty of the monument, leaving it exposed to thevulgar assault of the street by the operation of those dire facts ofabsence of margin, of meagreness of site, of the brevity of the block,of the inveteracy of the near thoroughfare, which leave style, inconstruction, at the mercy of the impertinent cross-streets, makedetachment and independence, save in the rarest cases, an insolubleproblem, preclude without pity any element of court or garden, and opento the builder in quest of distinction the one alternative, and thegreat adventure, of seeking his reward in the sky.Of their licence to pursue it there to any extent whatever New Yorkersare, I think, a trifle too assertively proud; no court of approach, nointerspace worth mention, ever forming meanwhile part of the ground-planor helping to receive the force of the breaking public wave. New Yorkpays at this rate the penalty of her primal topographic curse, her oldinconceivably bourgeois scheme of composition and distribution, theuncorrected labour of minds with no imagination of the future and blindbefore the opportunity given them by their two magnificent water-fronts.This original sin of the longitudinal avenues perpetually, yet meanlyintersected, and of the organized sacrifice of the indicatedalternative, the great perspectives from East to West, might still haveearned forgiveness by some occasional departure from its pettifoggingconsistency. But, thanks to this consistency, the city is, of all greatcities, the least endowed with any blest item of stately square orgoodly garden, with any happy accident or surprise, any fortunate nookor casual corner, any deviation, in fine, into the liberal or thecharming. That way, however, for the regenerate filial mind, madness maybe said to liethe way of imagining what might have been and putting itall together in the light of what so helplessly is. One of the thingsthat helplessly are, for instance, is just this assault of the street,as I have called it, upon any direct dealing with our caravansary. Theelectric cars, with their double track, are everywhere almost as tight afit in the narrow channel of the roadway as the projectile in the boreof a gun; so that the Waldorf-Astoria, sitting by this absent margin forlife with her open lap and arms, is reduced to confessing, with astrained smile, across the traffic and the danger, how little, outsideher mere swing-door, she can do for you. She seems to admit that theattempt to get at her may cost you your safety, but reminds you at thesame time that any good American, and even any good inquiring stranger,is supposed willing to risk that boon for her. _Un bon mouvement_,therefore: you must make a dash for it, but youll see Im worth it. Ifsuch a claim as this last be ever justified, it would indubitably bejustified here; the survivor scrambling out of the current and up thebank finds in the amplitude of the entertainment awaiting him an instantsense as of applied restoratives. The amazing hotel-world quickly closesround him; with the process of transition reduced to its minimum he istransported to conditions of extraordinary complexity and brilliancy,operatingand with proportionate perfectionby laws of their own andexpressing after their fashion a complete scheme of life. The airswarms, to intensity, with the _characteristic_, the characteristiccondensed and accumulated as he rarely elsewhere has had the luck tofind it. It jumps out to meet his every glance, and this unanimity ofits spring, of all its aspects and voices, is what I just now referredto as the essence of the loud New York story. That effect of violence inthe whole communication, at which I thus hint, results from theinordinate mass, the quantity of presence, as it were, of the testimonyheaped together for emphasis of the wondrous moral.The moral in question, the high interest of the tale, is that you are inpresence of a revelation of the possibilities of the hotelfor which theAmerican spirit has found so unprecedented a use and a value; leading iton to express so a social, indeed positively an sthetic ideal, andmaking it so, at this supreme pitch, a synonym for civilization, for thecapture of conceived manners themselves, that one is verily tempted toask if the hotel-spirit may not just _be_ the American spirit mostseeking and most finding itself. That truththe truth that the presentis more and more the day of the hotelhad not waited to burst on themind at the view of this particular establishment; we have all more orless been educated to it, the world over, by the fruit-bearing action ofthe American example: in consequence of which it has been opened to usto see still other societies moved by the same irresistible spring andtrying, with whatever grace and ease they may bring to the business, tounlearn as many as possible of their old social canons, and in especialtheir old discrimination in favour of the private life. The business forthemfor communities to which the American ease in such matters is notnativegoes much less of itself and produces as yet a scantier show; thegreat difference with the American show being that in the United Statesevery one is, for the lubrication of the general machinery, practicallyin everything, whereas in Europe, mostly, it is only certain people whoare in anything; so that the machinery, so much less generalized, worksin a smaller, stiffer way. This one caravansary makes the American casevivid, gives it, you feel, that quantity of illustration which rendersthe place a new thing under the sun. It is an expression of thegregarious state breaking down every barrier but twoone of which, thebarrier consisting of the high pecuniary tax, is the immediatelyobvious. The other, the rather more subtle, is the condition, for anymember of the flock, that he or shein other words especially shebepresumably respectable, be, that is, not discoverably anything else.The rigour with which any appearance of pursued or desired adventure iskept downadventure in the florid sense of the word, the sense in whichit remains an euphemismis not the least interesting note of the wholeimmense promiscuity. Protected at those two points the promiscuitycarries, through the rest of the range, everything before it.It sat there, it walked and talked, and ate and drank, and listened anddanced to music, and otherwise revelled and roamed, and bought and sold,and came and went there, all on its own splendid terms and with anencompassing material splendour, a wealth and variety of constitutedpicture and background, that might well feed it with the finestillusions about itself. It paraded through halls and saloons in whichart and history, in masquerading dress, muffled almost to suffocation asin the gold brocade of their pretended majesties and their conciliatorygraces, stood smirking on its passage with the last cynicism ofhypocrisy. The exhibition is wonderful for that, for the suggested senseof a promiscuity which manages to be at the same time an inordinateuntempered monotony; manages to be so, on such ground as this, by anextraordinary trick of its own, wherever one finds it. The combinationforms, I think, largely, the very interest, such as it is, of thesephases of the human scene in the United Statesif only for the pleasantpuzzle of our wondering how, when types, aspects, conditions, have somuch in common, they should seem at all to make up a consciousmiscellany. That question, however, the question of the play and range,the practical elasticity, of the social sameness, in America, will meetus elsewhere on our path, and I confess that all questions gave way, inmy mind, to a single irresistible obsession. This was just the ache ofenvy of the spirit of a society which had found there, in its prodigiouspublic setting, so exactly what it wanted. One was in presence, as neverbefore, of a realized ideal and of that childlike rush of surrender toit and clutch at it which one was so repeatedly to recognize, inAmerica, as the note of the supremely gregarious state. It made thewhole vision unforgettable, and I am now carried back to it, I confess,in musing hours, as to one of my few glimpses of perfect human felicity.It had the admirable sign that it was, precisely, so comprehensivelycollectivethat it made so vividly, in the old phrase, for the greatesthappiness of the greatest number. Its rare beauty, one felt with instantclarity of perception, was that it was, for a mixed socialmanifestation, blissfully exempt from any principle or possibility ofdisaccord with itself. It was absolutely a fit to its conditions, thoseconditions which were both its earth and its heaven, and every part ofthe picture, every item of the immense sum, every wheel of the wondrouscomplexity, was on the best terms with all the rest.The sense of these things became for the hour as the golden glow inwhich ones envy burned, and through which, while the sleet and theslosh, and the clangorous charge of cars, and the hustling, hustledcrowds held the outer world, one carried ones charmed attention fromone chamber of the temple to another. For that is how the place speaks,as great constructed and achieved harmonies mostly speakas a templebuilded, with clustering chapels and shrines, to an idea. The hundredsand hundreds of people in circulation, the innumerable huge-hattedladies in especial, with their air of finding in the gilded and storiedlabyrinth the very firesides and pathways of home, became thus theserene faithful, whose rites one would no more have sceptically brushedthan one would doff ones disguise in a Mohammedan mosque. The questionof who they all might be, seated under palms and by fountains, orcommuning, to some inimitable New York tune, with the shade of MarieAntoinette in the queer recaptured actuality of an easy Versailles or anintimate Trianonsuch questions as that, interesting in other societiesand at other times, insisted on yielding here to the mere eloquence ofthe general truth. Here was a social order in positively stableequilibrium. Here was a world whose relation to its form and medium waspractically imperturbable; here was a conception of publicity _as_ thevital medium organized with the authority with which the American geniusfor organization, put on its mettle, alone could organize it. The wholething remains for me, however, I repeat, a gorgeous golden blur, aparadise peopled with unmistakable American shapes, yet in which, thegeneral and the particular, the organized and the extemporized, theelement of ingenuous joy below and of consummate management above,melted together and left one uncertain which of them one was, at a giventurn of the maze, most admiring. When I reflect indeed that without myclue I should not have even known the mazeshould not have known, at thegiven turn, whether I was engulfed, for instance, in the _vente decharit_ of the theatrical profession and the onset of persuasivepeddling actresses, or in the annual tea-party of Germanlady-patronesses (of I know not what) filling with their Orientalopulence and their strange idiom a playhouse of the richest rococo,where some other expensive anniversary, the ball of a guild or thecarouse of a club, was to tread on their heels and instantly mobilizeaway their paraphernaliawhen I so reflect I see the sharpest dazzle ofthe eyes as precisely the play of the genius for organization.There are a thousand forms of this ubiquitous American force, the mostubiquitous of all, that I was in no position to measure; but there wasoften no resisting a vivid view of the form it may take, on occasion,under pressure of the native conception of the hotel. Encounteredembodiments of the gift, in this connection, master-spirits ofmanagement whose influence was as the very air, the very expensive air,one breathed, abide with me as the intensest examples of Americancharacter; indeed as the very interesting supreme examples of a typewhich has even on the American ground, doubtless, not said its lastword, but which has at least treated itself there to a luxury ofdevelopment. It gives the impression, when at all directly met, ofhaving at its service something of that fine flame that makes uppersonal greatness; so that, again and again, as I found, one would haveliked to see it more intimately at work. Such failures of opportunityand of penetration, however, are but the daily bread of the visionarytourist. Whenever I dip back, in fond memory, none the less, into thevision I have here attempted once more to call up, I see the whole thingoverswept as by the colossal extended arms, waving the magical baton, ofsome high-stationed orchestral leader, the absolute presiding power,conscious of every note of every instrument, controlling and commandingthe whole volume of sound, keeping the whole effect together and makingit what it is. What may one say of such a spirit if not that heunderstands, so to speak, the forces he sways, understands his boundlessAmerican material and plays with it like a master indeed? One sees itthus, in its crude plasticity, almost in the likeness of an army ofpuppets whose strings the wealth of his technical imagination teacheshim innumerable ways of pulling, and yet whose innocent, whose alwaysingenuous agitation of their members he has found means to make themthink of themselves as delightfully free and easy. Such was myimpression of the perfection of the concert that, for fear of its beingspoiled by some chance false note, I never went into the place again.It might meanwhile seem no great adventure merely to walk the streets;but (beside the fact that there is, in general, never a better way oftaking in life), this pursuit irresistibly solicited, on the leastpretext, the observer whose impressions I noteaccustomed as he had everbeen conscientiously to yield to it: more particularly with therelenting year, when the breath of spring, mildness being reallyinstalled, appeared the one vague and disinterested presence in theplace, the one presence not vociferous and clamorous. Any definitepresence that doesnt bellow and bang takes on in New York by thatsimple fact a distinction practically exquisite; so that one goes forthto meet it as a guest of honour, and that, for my own experience, Iremember certain aimless strolls as snatches of intimate communion withthe spirit of May and Juneas abounding, almost to enchantment, in thecomparatively _still_ condition. Two secrets, at this time, seemed toprofit by that influence to tremble out; one of these to the effect thatNew York would really have been meant to be charming, and the other tothe effect that the restless analyst, willing at the lightest persuasionto let so much of its ugliness edge away unscathed from his analysis,must have had for it, from far back, one of those loyalties that arebeyond any reason.Its all very well, the voice of the air seemed to say, if I may sotake it up; its all very well to criticize, but you distinctly takean interest and are the victim of your interest, be the grounds of yourperversity what they will. You cant escape from it, and dont you seethat this, precisely, is what _makes_ an adventure for you (anadventure, I admit, as with some strident, battered, questionablebeauty, truly some bold bad charmer), of almost any odd stroll, orwaste half-hour, or other promiscuous passage, that results for you inan impression? There is always your bad habit of receiving throughalmost any accident of vision more impressions than you know what to dowith; but that, for common convenience, is your eternal handicap and maynot be allowed to plead here against your special responsibility. You_care_ for the terrible town, yea even for the horrible, as I haveoverheard you call it, or at least think it, when you supposed no onewould know; and you see now how, if you fly such fancies as that it wasconceivably meant to be charming, you are tangled by that weakness insome underhand imagination of its possibly, one of these days, as ariper fruit of time, becoming so. To do that, you indeed sneakinglyprovide, it must get away from itself; but you are ready to follow itshypothetic dance even to the mainland and to the very end of its tether.What makes the general relation of your adventure with it is that, atbottom, you are all the while wondering, in presence of the aspects ofits genius and its shame, what elements or parts, if any, would be worthits saving, worth carrying off for the fresh embodiment and the betterlife, and which of them would have, on the other hand, to face thenotoriety of going _first_ by the board. I have literally heard youqualify the monster as shamelessthough that was wrung from you, Iadmit, by the worst of the winter conditions, when circulation, in anyfashion consistent with personal decency or dignity, was merely mockedat, when the stony-hearted trolleys, cars of Juggernaut in their powerto squash, triumphed all along the line, when the February blasts becameas cyclones in the darkened gorges of masonry (which down-town, inparticular, put on, at their mouths, the semblance of black rat-holes,holes of gigantic rats, inhabited by whirlwinds;) when all the pretencesand impunities and infirmities, in fine, had massed themselves to behurled at you in the fury of the elements, in the character of thetraffic, in the unadapted state of the place to almost _any_ densemovement, and, beyond everything, in that pitch of all the noises whichacted on your nerves as so much wanton provocation, so much consciouscynicism. The fury of sound took the form of derision of the rest ofyour woe, and thus it _might_, I admit, have struck you as brazen thatthe horrible place should, in such confessed collapse, still beswaggering and shouting. It might have struck you that great cities,with the eyes of the world on them, as the phrase is, should be capableeither of a proper form or (failing this) of a proper compunction; whichtributes to propriety were, on the part of New York, equally wanting.This made you remark, precisely, that nothing was wanting, on the otherhand, to that analogy with the character of the bad bold beauty, thecreature the most blatant of whose pretensions is that she is one ofthose to whom everything is always forgiven. On what ground forgiven?of course you ask; but note that you ask it while youre in the very actof forgiving. Oh yes, you are; youve as much as said so yourself. Sothere it all is; arrange it as you can. Poor dear bad bold beauty; theremust indeed be something about her!Let me grant then, to get on, that there _was_ doubtless, in the bettertime, something about her; there was enough about her, at all events, toconduce to that distinct cultivation of her company for which thecontemplative stroll, when there was time for it, was but another name.The analogy was in truth complete; since the repetition of such walks,and the admission of the beguiled state contained in them, resemblednothing so much as the visits so often still incorrigibly made tocompromised charmers. I defy even a master of morbid observation toperambulate New York unless he be interested; so that in a case ofmemories so gathered the interest must be taken as a final fact. Let mefigure it, to this end, as lively in every connectionand so indeed nomore lively at one mild crisis than at another. The crisiseven ofobservation at the morbid pitchis inevitably mild in cities intenselynew; and it was with the quite peculiarly insistent newness of the upperreaches of the town that the spirit of romantic inquiry had always, atthe best, to reckon. There are new cities enough about the world,goodness knows, and there are new parts enough of old citiesforexamples of which we need go no farther than London, Paris and Rome, allof late so mercilessly renovated. But the newness of New Yorkunlikeeven that of Boston, I seemed to discernhad this mark of its very own,that it affects one, in every case, as having treated itself as stillmore provisional, if possible, than any poor dear little interest ofantiquity it may have annihilated. The very sign of its energy is thatit doesnt believe in itself; it fails to succeed, even at a cost ofmillions, in persuading you that it does. Its mission would appear tobe, exactly, to gild the temporary, with its gold, as many inches thickas may be, and then, with a fresh shrug, a shrug of its splendidcynicism for its freshly detected inability to convince, give up itsactual work, however exorbitant, as the merest of stop-gaps. Thedifficulty with the compromised charmer is just this constant inabilityto convince; to convince ever, I mean, that she is serious, seriousabout any form whatever, or about anything but that perpetual passionatepecuniary purpose which plays with all forms, which derides and devoursthem, though it may pile up the cost of them in order to rest a while,spent and haggard, in the illusion of their finality.The perception of this truth grows for you by your simply walkingup Fifth Avenue and pausing a little in presence of certain forms,certain exorbitant structures, in other words, the elegantdomiciliary, as to which the illusion of finality was within onesmemory magnificent and complete, but as to which one feels to-daythat their life wouldnt be, as against any whisper of a higherinterest, worth an hours purchase. They sit there in the floridmajesty of the taste of their timea light now, alas, generallyclouded; and I pretend of course to speak, in alluding to them, ofno individual case of danger or doom. It is only a question ofthat unintending and unconvincing expression of New Yorkeverywhere, as yet, on the matter of the _maintenance_ of a giveneffectwhich comes back to the general insincerity of effects, andtruly even (as I have already noted) to the insincerity of theeffect of the sky-scrapers themselves. There results from allthisand as much where the place most smells of its millions aselsewherethat unmistakable New York admission of unattempted,impossible maturity. The new Paris and the new Rome do at leastpropose, I think, to be oldone of these days; the new Londoneven, erect as she is on leaseholds destitute of dignity, yetdoes, for the period, appear to believe in herself. The vice Iglance at is, however, when showing, in our flagrant example, onthe forehead of its victims, much more a cause for pitying thanfor decrying them. Again and again, in the upper reaches, youpause with that pity; you learn, on the occasion of a kindlyglance up and down a quiet cross-street (there being objects andaspects in many of them appealing to kindness), that such and sucha house, or a row, is coming down; and you gasp, in presence ofthe elements involved, at the strangeness of the moral so pointed.It rings out like the crack of that lash in the sky, the play ofsome mighty teamsters whip, which ends by affecting you as thepoor New Yorkers one association with the idea of powers above.Nothis is the tune to which the whip seems flourishedtheresno step at which you shall rest, no form, as Im constantlyshowing you, to which, consistently with my interests, you _can_.I build you up but to tear you down, for if I were to letsentiment and sincerity once take root, were to let any tendernessof association once accumulate, or any love of the old once passunsnubbed, what would become of _us_, who have our hands on thewhipstock, please? Fortunately weve learned the secret forkeeping association at bay. Weve learned that the great thing isnot to suffer it to so much as begin. Wherever it does begin wefind were lost; but as that takes some time we get in ahead. Itsthe reason, if you must know, why you shall run, all, withoutexception, to the fifty floors. We defy you even to aspire tovenerate shapes so grossly constructed as the arrangement in fiftyfloors. You may have a feeling for keeping on with an oldstaircase, consecrated by the tread of generationsespecially whenits good, and old staircases are often so lovely; but how canyou have a feeling for keeping on with an old elevator, how canyou have it any more than for keeping on with an old omnibus?Youd be ashamed to venerate the arrangement in fifty floors,accordingly, even if you could; whereby, saving you any moraltrouble or struggle, they are conceived and constructedand youmust do us the justice of this care for your sensibilityin amanner to put the thing out of the question. In such a manner,moreover, as that there shall be immeasurably more of them, inquantity, to tear down than of the actual past that we are nowsweeping away. Wherefore we shall be kept in precious practice.The word will perhaps be thenwho knows?for building from theearth-surface downwards; in which case it will be a question oftearing, so to speak, up. It little matters, so long as weblight the superstition of rest.Yet even in the midst of this vision of eternal waste, of conscious,sentient-looking houses and rows, full sections of streets, to which therich taste of history is forbidden even while their fresh young lips arejust touching the cup, something charmingly done, here and there, somebid for the ampler permanence, seems to say to you that the particularplace only asks, as a human home, to lead the life it has begun, onlyasks to enfold generations and gather in traditions, to show itselfcapable of growing up to character and authority. Houses of the besttaste are like clothes of the best tailorsit takes their age to show ushow good they are; and I frequently recognized, in the region of theupper reaches, this direct appeal of the individual case of happyconstruction. Construction at large abounds in the upper reaches,construction indescribably precipitate and elaboratethe latter factabout it always so oddly hand in hand with the former; and we shouldexceed in saying that felicity is always its mark. But some highlyliberal, some extravagant intention almost always is, and we meet hereeven that happy accident, already encountered and acclaimed, in its fewexamples, down-town, of the object shining almost absurdly in the lightof its merely comparative distinction. All but lost in the welter ofinstances of sham refinement, the shy little case of real refinementdetaches itself ridiculously, as being (like the saved City Hall, orlike the pleasant old garden-walled house on the north-west corner ofWashington Square and Fifth Avenue) of so beneficent an admonition as toshow, relatively speaking, for priceless. These things, which I may nottake time to pick out, are the salt that saves, and it is enough to sayfor their delicacy that they are the direct counterpart of those otherdreadful presences, looming round them, which embody the imagination ofnew kinds and new clustered, emphasized quantities of vulgarity. Torecall these fine notes and these loud ones, the whole play of wealthand energy and untutored liberty, of the movement of a breathlesscivilization reflected, as brick and stone and marble may reflect,through all the contrasts of prodigious flight and portentous stumble,is to acknowledge, positively, that ones rambles were delightful, andthat the district abutting on the east side of the Park, in particular,never engaged my attention without, by the same stroke, making thesocial question dance before it in a hundred interesting forms.The social question quite fills the air, in New York, for any spectatorwhose impressions at all follow themselves up; it wears, at any rate, inwhat I have called the upper reaches, the perpetual strange appearanceas of Property perched high aloft and yet itself looking about, allruefully, in the wonder of what it is exactly doing there. We see itperched, assuredly, in other and older cities, other and older socialorders; but it strikes us in those situations as knowing a little morewhere it is. It strikes us as knowing how it has got up and why it must,infallibly, stay up; it has not the frightened look, measuring thespaces around, of a small child set on a mantelshelf and about to cryout. If old societies are interesting, however, I am far from thinkingthat young ones may not be more sowith their collective countenance somuch more presented, precisely, to observation, as by their artless needto get themselves explained. The American world produces almosteverywhere the impression of appealing to any attested interest for theword, the _fin mot_, of what it may mean; but I somehow see those partsof it most at a loss that are already explained not a little by theample possession of money. This is the amiable side there of the largedevelopments of private ease in generalthe amiable side of thosenumerous groups that are rich enough and, in the happy vulgar phrase,bloated enough, to be candidates for the classic imputation ofhaughtiness. The amiability proceeds from an essential vagueness;whereas real haughtiness is never vague about itselfit is only vagueabout others. That is the human note in the huge American rattle ofgoldso far as the social field is the scene of the rattle. Thebusiness field is a different matteras to which the determination ofthe audibility in it of the human note (so interesting to try for if onehad but the warrant) is a line of research closed to me, alas, by myfatally uninitiated state. My point is, at all events, that you cannotbe hard, really, with any society that affects you as ready to learnfrom you, and from this resource for it of your detachment combiningwith your proximity, what in the name of all its possessions and all itsdestitutions it would honestly be at.                                  III                        NEW YORK AND THE HUDSON                          A SPRING IMPRESSION                                   IIt was a concomitant, always, of the down-town hour that it could befelt as _most_ playing into the surrendered consciousness and making thesharpest impression; yet, since the up-town hour was apt, in its turn,to claim the same distinction, I could only let each of them take itsway with me as it would. The oddity was that they seemed not at all tospeak of different thingsby so quick a process does any one aspect, inthe United States, in general, I was to note, connect itself with therest; so little does any link in the huge looseness of New York, inespecial, appear to come as a whole, or as final, out of the fusion. Thefusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot, is always goingon, and one stage of the process is as typical or as vivid as another.Whatever I might be looking at, or be struck with, the object or thephase was an item in the pressing conditions of the place, and as suchhad more in common with its sister items than it had in difference fromthem. It mattered little, moreover, whether this might be a proof thatNew York, among cities, most deeply languishes and palpitates, orvibrates and flourishes (whichever way one may put it) under the breathof her conditions, or whether, simply, this habit of finding a little of_all_ my impressions reflected in any one of them testified to theenjoyment of a real relation with the subject. I like indeed to think ofmy relation to New York as, in that manner, almost inexpressiblyintimate, and as hence making, for daily sensation, a keyboard ascontinuous, and as free from hard transitions, as if swept by thefingers of a master-pianist. You cannot, surely, say more for your senseof the underlying unity of an occasion than that the taste of each dishin the banquet recalls the taste of most of the others; which is what Imean by the continuity, not to say the affinity, on the island ofManhattan, between the fish and the sweets, between the soup and thegame. The whole feast affects one as eatenthat is the pointwith thegeneral queer sauce of New York; a preparation as freely diffused,somehow, on the East side as on the West, in the quarter of Grand Streetas in the quarter of Murray Hill. No fact, I hasten to add, would appearto make the place more amenable to delineations of the order that may bespoken of as hanging together.I must confess, notwithstanding, to not being quite ready to pointdirectly to the common element in the dense Italian neighbourhoods ofthe lower East side, and in the upper reaches of Fifth and of MadisonAvenues; though indeed I wonder at this inability in recollecting two orthree of those charming afternoons of early summer, in Central Park,which showed the fruit of the foreign tree as shaken down there with aforce that smothered everything else. The long residential vistas I havenamed were within a quarter of an hours walk, but the alien was astruly in possession, under the high aristocratic nose, as if he hadhad but three steps to come. If it be asked why, the alien stillstriking you so as an alien, the singleness of impression, throughoutthe place, should still be so marked, the answer, close at hand, wouldseem to be that the alien himself fairly _makes_ the singleness ofimpression. Is not the universal sauce essentially _his_ sauce, and dowe not feel ourselves feeding, half the time, from the ladle, as greasyas he chooses to leave it for us, that he holds out? Such questions werein my ears, at all events, with the cheerful hum of that babel oftongues established in the vernal Park, and they supplied, beyond doubt,the livelier interest of any hour of contemplation there. I hate todrift into dealing with them at the expense of a proper tribute, keptdistinct and vivid, to the charming bosky precinct itself, the greatfield of recreation with which they swarmed; but it could not be thefault of the brooding visitor, and still less that of the restoredabsentee, if he was conscious of the need of mental adjustment tophenomena absolutely fresh. He could remember still how, months before,a day or two after his restoration, a noted element of one of his firstimpressions had been this particular revealed anomaly. He had been, onthe Jersey shore, walking with a couple of friends through the groundsof a large new rural residence, where groups of diggers and ditcherswere working, on those lines of breathless haste which seem always, inthe United States, of the essence of any question, toward an expensiveeffect of landscape gardening. To pause before them, for interest intheir labour, was, and would have been everywhere, instinctive; but whatcame home to me on the spot was that whatever _more_ would have beenanywhere else involved had here inevitably to lapse.What lapsed, on the spot, was the element of communication with theworkers, as I may call it for want of a better name; that element which,in a European country, would have operated, from side to side, as theplay of mutual recognition, founded on old familiarities and heredities,and involving, for the moment, some impalpable exchange. The men, in thecase I speak of, were Italians, of superlatively southern type, and anyimpalpable exchange struck me as absent from the air to positiveintensity, to mere unthinkability. It was as if contact were out of thequestion and the sterility of the passage between us recorded, with duedryness, in our staring silence. This impression was for one of theparty a shocka member of the party for whom, on the other side of theworld, the imagination of the main furniture, as it might be called, ofany rural excursion, of _the_ rural in particular, had been, duringyears, the easy sense, for the excursionist, of a social relation withany encountered type, from whichever end of the scale proceeding. Hadthat not ever been, exactly, a part of the vague warmth, the intrinsiccolour, of any honest mans rural walk in his England or his Italy, hisGermany or his France, and was not the effect of its so suddenlydropping out, in the land of universal brotherhoodfor I was to find itdrop out again and againrather a chill, straightway, for the heart, andrather a puzzle, not less, for the head? Shortly after the spring ofthis question was first touched for me I found it ring out again with asharper stroke. Happening to have lost my way, during a long rambleamong the New Hampshire hills, I appealed, for information, at a partingof the roads, to a young man whom, at the moment of my need, I happilysaw emerge from a neighbouring wood. But his stare was blank, in answerto my inquiry, and, seeing that he failed to understand me and that hehad a dark-eyed Latin look, I jumped to the inference of his being aFrench Canadian. My repetition of my query in French, however, forwardedthe case as little, and my trying him with Italian had no better effect.What _are_ you then? I wonderingly askedon which my accent loosenedin him the faculty of speech. Im an Armenian, he replied, as if itwere the most natural thing in the world for a wage-earning youth in theheart of New England to beso that all I could do was to try and make myprofit of the lesson. I could have made it better, for the occasion, if,even on the Armenian basis, he had appeared to expect brotherhood; butthis had been as little his seeming as it had been that of the diggersby the Jersey shore.To inquire of these things on the spot, to betray, that is, ones senseof the chill of which I have spoken, is of course to hear it admitted,promptly enough, that there is no claim to brotherhood with aliens inthe first grossness of their alienism. The material of which theyconsist is being dressed and prepared, at this stage, for brotherhood,and the consummation, in respect to many of them, will not be, can notfrom the nature of the case be, in any lifetime of their own. Theirchildren are another matteras in fact the children throughout theUnited States, are an immense matter, are almost the greatest matter ofall; it is the younger generation who will fully profit, rise to theoccasion and enter into the privilege. The machinery is colossalnothingis more characteristic of the country than the development of thismachinery, in the form of the political and social habit, the commonschool and the newspaper; so that there are always millions of littletransformed strangers growing up in regard to whom the idea of intimacyof relation may be as freely cherished as you like. _They_ are the stuffof whom brothers and sisters are made, and the making proceeds on ascale that really need leave nothing to desire. All this you take in,with a wondering mind, and in the light of it the great ethnicquestion rises before you on a corresponding scale and with acorresponding majesty. Once it has set your observation, to say nothingof your imagination, working, it becomes for you, as you go and come,the wonderment to which everything ministers and that is quickenedwell-nigh to madness, in some places and on some occasions, by everyface and every accent that meet your eyes and ears. The sense of theelements in the cauldronthe cauldron of the Americancharacterbecomes thus about as vivid a thing as you can at all quietlymanage, and the question settles into a form which makes theintelligible answer further and further recede. What meaning, in thepresence of such impressions, can continue to attach to such a term asthe American character?what type, as the result of such a prodigiousamalgam, such a hotch-potch of racial ingredients, is to be conceived asshaping itself? The challenge to speculation, fed thus by a thousandsources, is so intense as to be, as I say, irritating; but practically,beyond doubt, I should also say, you take refuge from itsince your casewould otherwise be hard; and you find your relief not in the least inany direct satisfaction or solution, but absolutely in that blestgeneral drop of the immediate need of conclusions, or rather in thatblest general feeling for the impossibility of them, to which thephilosophy of any really fine observation of the American spectacle mustreduce itself, and the large intellectual, quite even the largesthetic, margin supplied by which accompanies the spectator as his onepositively complete comfort.It is more than a comfort to him, truly, in all the conditions, thisaccepted vision of the too-defiant scale of numerosity and quantitytheeffect of which is so to multiply the possibilities, so to open, by themillion, contingent doors and windows: he rests in it at last as anabsolute luxury, converting it even into a substitute, into _the_constant substitute, for many luxuries that are absent. He doesnt_know_, he cant _say_, before the facts, and he doesnt even want toknow or to say; the facts themselves loom, before the understanding, intoo large a mass for a mere mouthful: it is as if the syllables were toonumerous to make a legible word. The _il_legible word, accordingly, thegreat inscrutable answer to questions, hangs in the vast American sky,to his imagination, as something fantastic and _abracadabrant_,belonging to no known language, and it is under this convenient ensignthat he travels and considers and contemplates, and, to the best of hisability, enjoys. The interesting point, in the connection, is moreoverthat this particular effect of the scale of things is the only effectthat, throughout the land, is not directly adverse to joy. Extent andreduplication, the multiplication of cognate items and the continuity ofmotion, are elements that count, there, in general, for fatigue andsatiety, prompting the earnest observer, overburdened perhaps already alittle by his earnestness, to the reflection that the country is toolarge for any human convenience, that it can scarce, in the scheme ofProvidence, have been meant to be dealt with as we are trying, perhapsall in vain, to deal with it, and that its very possibilities ofpopulation themselves cause one to wince in the light of the question ofintercourse and contact. That relation to its superficies andcontentthe relation of flat fatigueis, with the traveller, a constantquantity; so that he feels himself justified of the inward, thephilosophic, escape into the immensity. And as it is the restoredabsentee, with his acquired habit of nearer limits and shorter journeysand more muffled concussions, who is doubtless most subject to flatfatigue, so it is this same personage who most avails himself of theliberty of waiting to see. It is an advantageacting often in the way ofa compensation, or of an appeal from the immediatethat he becomes,early in his period of inquiry, conscious of intimately invoking, inwhatever apparent inconsistency it may lodge him. There is too much ofthe whole thing, he sighs, for the personal relation with it; and yet hewould desire no inch less for the relation that he describes to himselfbest perhaps either as the provisionally-imaginative or as thedistantly-respectful. Diminution of quantity, even by that inch, mightmark the difference of his having to begin to recognize from afar, asthrough a rift in the obscurity, the gleam of some propriety of opinion.What would a man make, many things still being as they are, he findshimself asking, of a _small_ America?and what may a big one, on theother hand, still not make of itself? Goodness be thanked, accordingly,for the bigness. The state of flat fatigue, obviously, is not anopinion, save in the sense attributed to the slumber of the gentleman ofthe anecdote who had lost consciousness during the reading of theplayit belongs to the order of mere sensation and impression; and as tothese the case is quite different: he may have as many of each as he cancarry.                                   IIThe process of the mitigation and, still more, of the conversion of thealien goes on, meanwhile, obviously, not by leaps and bounds or any formof easy magic, but under its own mystic laws and with an outward air ofquite declining to be unduly precipitated. How little it may be thoughtof in New York as a quick business we readily perceive as the effect ofmerely remembering the vast numbers of their kind that the arrivingreinforcements, from whatever ends of the earth, find already inpossession of the field. There awaits the disembarked Armenian, forinstance, so warm and furnished an Armenian corner that the need ofhurrying to get rid of the sense of it must become less and less apressing preliminary. The corner growing warmer and warmer, it is to besupposed, by rich accretions, he may take his time, more and more, forbecoming absorbed in the surrounding element, and he may in fact feelmore and more that he can do so on his own conditions. I seem to findindeed in this latter truth a hint for the best expression of a wholeside of New Yorkthe best expression of much of the medium in which oneconsciously moves. It is formed by this fact that the alien is takinghis time, and that you go about with him meanwhile, sharing, allrespectfully, in his deliberation, waiting on his convenience, watchinghim at his interesting work. The vast foreign quarters of the citypresent him as thus engaged in it, and they are curious and portentousand picturesque just by reason of their doing so. You recognize inthem, freely, those elements that are not elements of swiftconvertibility, and you lose yourself in the wonder of what becomes, asit were, of the obstinate, the unconverted residuum. The country atlarge, as you cross it in different senses, keeps up its character foryou as the hugest thinkable organism for successful assimilation; butthe assimilative force itself has the residuum still to count with. Theoperation of the immense machine, identical after all with the total ofAmerican life, trembles away into mysteries that are beyond our presentnotation and that reduce us in many a mood to renouncing analysis.Who and what is an alien, when it comes to that, in a country peopledfrom the first under the jealous eye of history?peopled, that is, bymigrations at once extremely recent, perfectly traceable and urgentlyrequired. They are still, it would appear, urgently requiredif we lookabout far enough for the urgency; though of that truth such a scene asNew York may well make one doubt. Which is the American, by these scantmeasures?which is _not_ the alien, over a large part of the country atleast, and where does one put a finger on the dividing line, or, forthat matter, spot and identify any particular phase of the conversion,any one of its successive moments? The sense of the interest of so doingis doubtless half the interest of the general questionthe possibilityof our seeing lucidly presented some such phenomenon, in a given groupof persons, or even in a felicitous individual, as the dawn of theAmerican spirit while the declining rays of the Croatian, say, or of theCalabrian, or of the Lusitanian, still linger more or less pensively inthe sky. Fifty doubts and queries come up, in regard to any suchpossibility, as one circulates in New York, with the so ambiguouselement in the _launched_ foreign personality always in ones eyes; thewonder, above all, of whether there be, comparatively, in the vastlygreater number of the representatives of the fresh contingent, anyspirit that the American does not find an easy prey. Repeatedly, in theelectric cars, one seemed invited to take that for grantedthere beingoccasions, days and weeks together, when the electric cars offer younothing else to think of. The carful, again and again, is a foreigncarful; a row of faces, up and down, testifying, without exception, toalienism unmistakable, alienism undisguised and unashamed. You do here,in a manner perhaps, discriminate; the launched condition, as I havecalled it, is more developed in some types than in others; but Iremember observing how, in the Broadway and the Bowery conveyances inespecial, they tended, almost alike, to make the observer gasp with thesense of isolation. It was not for this that the observer on whosebehalf I more particularly write had sought to take up again the sweetsense of the natal air.The great fact about his companions was that, foreign as they might be,newly inducted as they might be, they were _at home_, really more athome, at the end of their few weeks or months or their year or two, thanthey had ever in their lives been before; and that _he_ was at home too,quite with the same intensity: and yet that it was this very equality ofcondition that, from side to side, made the whole medium so strange.Here again, however, relief may be sought and foundand I say this atthe risk of perhaps picturing the restored absentee as too constantlyrequiring it; for there is fascination in the study of the innumerableways in which this sense of being at home, on the part of all the types,may show forth. New York offers to such a study a well-nigh unlimitedfield, but I seem to recall winter days, harsh, dusky, sloshy winterafternoons, in the densely-packed East-side street-cars, as anespecially intimate surrender to it. It took its place thus, I think,under the general American law of _all_ relief from the great equalizingpressure: it took on that last disinterestedness which consists of onesgetting away from ones subject by plunging into it, for sweet truthssake, still deeper. If I speak, moreover, of this general firstgrossness of alienism as presented in types, I use that word for easyconvenience and not in respect to its indicating marked variety. Thereare many different ways, certainly, in which obscure fighters of thebattle of life may look, under new high lights, queer and crude andunwrought; but the striking thing, precisely, in the crepuscular,tunnel-like avenues that the Elevated overarchesyet withoutquenching, either, that constant power of any American exhibition ratherluridly to light itselfthe striking thing, and the beguiling, wasalways the manner in which figure after figure and face after facealready betrayed the common consequence and action of their whereabouts.Face after face, unmistakably, was lowparticularly in the men,squared all solidly in their new security and portability, their vaguebut growing sense of many unprecedented things; and as signs of thereinforcing of a large local conception of manners and relations it wasdifficult to say if they most affected one as promising or asportentous.The great thing, at any rate, was that they were all together so visiblyon the new, the lifted levelthat of consciously not being what they_had_ been, and that this immediately glazed them over as with somemixture, of indescribable hue and consistency, the wholesale varnish ofconsecration, that might have been applied, out of a bottomlessreceptacle, by a huge white-washing brush. Here, perhaps, was thenearest approach to a seizable step in the evolution of the oncomingcitizen, the stage of his no longer being for youfor any complacency ofthe romantic, or even verily of the fraternizing, sense in youtheforeigner of the quality, of the kind, that he might have been _chezlui_. Whatever he might see himself becoming, he was never to seehimself that again, any more than you were ever to see him. He becamethen, to my vision (which I have called fascinated for want of a betterdescription of it), a creature promptly despoiled of those mannerswhich were the grace (as I am again reduced to calling it) by which onehad best known and, on opportunity, best liked him. He presents himselfthus, most of all, to be plainand not only in New York, but throughoutthe countryas wonderingly conscious that his manners of the otherworld, that everything you have there known and praised him for, havebeen a huge mistake: to that degree that the sense of this luminousdiscovery is what we mainly imagine his weighted communications to thosehe has left behind charged with; those rich letters home as to thenumber and content of which the Post Office gives us so remarkable astatistic. If there are several lights in which the great assimilativeorganism itself may be looked at, does it not still perhaps loom largestas an agent for revealing to the citizen-to-be the error in question? Hehears it, under this aegis, proclaimed in a thousand voices, and it isas listening to these and as, according to the individual, more or lessswiftly, but always infallibly, penetrated and convinced by them, that Ifelt myself see him go about his business, see him above all, for someodd reason, sit there in the street-car, and with a slow, broodinggravity, a dim calculation of bearings, which yet never takes a backwardstep, expand to the full measure of it.So, in New York, largely, the American value of the immigrant whoarrives at all mature is restricted to the enjoyment (all prepared toincrease) of that important preliminary truth; which makes him for us,we must own, till more comes of it, a tolerably neutral and colourlessimage. He resembles for the time the dog who sniffs round thefreshly-acquired bone, giving it a push and a lick, betraying a sense ofits possibilities, but notand quite as from a positive deep tremor ofconsciousnessdirectly attacking it. There are categories of foreigners,truly, meanwhile, of whom we are moved to say that only a mechanismworking with scientific force could have performed this feat of makingthem colourless. The Italians, who, over the whole land, strike us, I amafraid, as, after the Negro and the Chinaman, the human value mosteasily produced, the Italians meet us, at every turn, only to make usask what has become of that element of the agreeable address in _them_which has, from far back, so enhanced for the stranger the interest andpleasure of a visit to their beautiful country. They shed it utterly, Icouldnt but observe, on their advent, after a deep inhalation or two ofthe clear native air; shed it with a conscientious completeness whichleaves one looking for any faint trace of it. Colour, of that pleasantsort, was what they had appeared, among the races of the Europeanfamily, most to have; so that the effect I speak of, the rapid action ofthe ambient air, is like that of the tub of hot water that reduces apiece of bright-hued stuff, on immersion, to the proved state of notwashing: the only fault of my image indeed being that if the stuffloses its brightness the water of the tub at least is more or lessagreeably dyed with it. That is doubtless not the case for the ambientair operating after the fashion I here notesince we surely fail toobserve that the property washed out of the new subject begins to tintwith its pink or its azure his fellow-soakers in the terrible tank. Ifthis property that has quitted himthe general amenity of attitude inthe absence of provocation to its oppositecould be accounted for by itshaving rubbed off on any number of surrounding persons, the wholeprocess would be easier and perhaps more comforting to follow. It willnot have been his first occasion of taking leave of short-sightedcomfort in the United States, however, if the patient inquirer postponesthat ideal to the real solicitation of the question I here touch on.What _does_ become of the various positive properties, on the part ofcertain of the installed tribes, the good manners, say, among them, asto which the process of shedding and the fact of eclipse come sopromptly into play? It has taken long ages of history, in the otherworld, to produce them, and you ask yourself, with independentcuriosity, if they may really be thus extinguished in an hour. And ifthey are not extinguished, into what pathless tracts of the nativeatmosphere do they virtually, do they provisionally, and so allundiscoverably, melt? Do they burrow underground, to await their dayagain?or in what strange secret places are they held in deposit and intrust? The American identity that has profited by their sacrifice hasmeanwhile acquired (in the happiest cases) all apparent confidence andconsistency; but may not the doubt remain of whether the extinction ofqualities ingrained in generations is to be taken for quite complete?Isnt it conceivable that, for something like a final efflorescence, thebusiness of slow comminglings and makings-over at last ended, they mayrise again to the surface, affirming their vitality and value andplaying their part? It would be for them, of course, in this event, toattest that they had been worth waiting so long for; but thespeculation, at any rate, irresistibly forced upon us, is a sign of theinterest, in the American world, of what I have called the ethnicoutlook. The cauldron, for the great stew, has such circumference andsuch depth that we can only deal here with ultimate syntheses, ultimatecombinations and possibilities. Yet I am well aware that if these vagueevocations of them, in their nebulous remoteness, may charm theingenuity of the student of the scene, there are matters of theforeground that they have no call to supplant. Any temptation to letthem do so is meanwhile, no doubt, but a proof of that impulseirresponsibly to escape from the formidable foreground which so often,in the American world, lies in wait for the spirit of intellectualdalliance.                                  IIINew York really, I think, is all formidable foreground; or, if it benot, there is more than enough of this pressure of the present and theimmediate to cut out the close sketchers work for him. These things area thick growth all round him, and when I recall the intensity of thematerial picture in the dense Yiddish quarter, for instance, I wonder atits not having forestalled, on my page, mere musings and, as they willdoubtless be called, moonings. There abides with me, ineffaceably, thememory of a summer evening spent there by invitation of a high publicfunctionary domiciled on the spotto the extreme enhancement of theromantic interest his visitor found him foredoomed to inspirewho was toprove one of the most liberal of hosts and most luminous of guides. Ican scarce help it if this brilliant personality, on that occasion thevery medium itself through which the whole spectacle showed, so coloursmy impressions that if I speak, by intention, of the facts that playedinto them I may really but reflect the rich talk and the generalprivilege of the hour. That accident moreover must take its place simplyas the highest value and the strongest note in the total showso muchdid it testify to the quality of appealing, surrounding life. The senseof this quality was already strong in my drive, with a companion,through the long, warm June twilight, from a comparatively conventionalneighbourhood; it was the sense, after all, of a great swarming, aswarming that had begun to thicken, infinitely, as soon as we hadcrossed to the East side and long before we had got to Rutgers Street.There is no swarming like that of Israel when once Israel has got astart, and the scene here bristled, at every step, with the signs andsounds, immitigable, unmistakable, of a Jewry that had burst all bounds.That it has burst all bounds in New York, almost any combination offigures or of objects taken at hazard sufficiently proclaims; but Iremember how the rising waters, on this summer night, rose, to theimagination, even above the housetops and seemed to sound their murmurto the pale distant stars. It was as if we had been thus, in thecrowded, hustled roadway, where multiplication, multiplication ofeverything, was the dominant note, at the bottom of some vast sallowaquarium in which innumerable fish, of over-developed proboscis, were tobump together, for ever, amid heaped spoils of the sea.The children swarmed above allhere was multiplication with a vengeance;and the number of very old persons, of either sex, was almost equallyremarkable; the very old persons being in equal vague occupation of thedoorstep, pavement, curbstone, gutter, roadway, and every one alikeusing the street for overflow. As overflow, in the whole quarter, is themain fact of lifeI was to learn later on that, with the exception ofsome shy corner of Asia, no district in the world known to thestatistician has so many inhabitants to the yardthe scene hummed withthe human presence beyond any I had ever faced in quest even ofrefreshment; producing part of the impression, moreover, no doubt, as adirect consequence of the intensity of the Jewish aspect. This, I think,makes the individual Jew more of a concentrated person, savinglypossessed of everything that is in him, than any other human, noted atrandomor is it simply, rather, that the unsurpassed strength of therace permits of the chopping into myriads of fine fragments without lossof race-quality? There are small strange animals, known to naturalhistory, snakes or worms, I believe, who, when cut into pieces, wriggleaway contentedly and live in the snippet as completely as in the whole.So the denizens of the New York Ghetto, heaped as thick as the splinterson the table of a glass-blower, had each, like the fine glass particle,his or her individual share of the whole hard glitter of Israel. Thisdiffused intensity, as I have called it, causes any array of Jews toresemble (if I may be allowed another image) some long nocturnal streetwhere every window in every house shows a maintained light. The advancedage of so many of the figures, the ubiquity of the children, carried outin fact this analogy; they were all there for race, and not, as it were,for reason: that excess of lurid meaning, in some of the old mens andold womens faces in particular, would have been absurd, in theconditions, as a really directed attentionit could only be the gatheredpast of Israel mechanically pushing through. The way, at the same time,this chapter of history did, all that evening, seem to push, was amatter that made the ethnic apparition again sit like a skeleton atthe feast. It was fairly as if I could see the spectre grin while thetalk of the hour gave me, across the board, facts and figures, chapterand verse, for the extent of the Hebrew conquest of New York. With areverence for intellect, one should doubtless have drunk in tribute toan intellectual people; but I remember being at no time more consciousof that merely portentous element, in the aspects of American growth,which reduces to inanity any marked dismay quite as much as any highelation. The portent is one of too manyyou always come back, as I havehinted, with your easier gasp, to _that_: it will be time enough to sighor to shout when the relation of the particular appearance to all theother relations shall have cleared itself up. Phantasmagoric for me,accordingly, in a high degree, are the interesting hours I here glanceat content to remainsetting in this respect, I recognize, an excellentexample to all the rest of the New York phantasmagoria. Let me speak ofthe remainder only as phantasmagoric too, so that I may both the morekindly recall it and the sooner have done with it.I have not done, however, with the impression of that large evening inthe Ghetto; there was too much in the vision, and it has left too muchthe sense of a rare experience. For what did it all really come to butthat one had seen with ones eyes the New Jerusalem on earth? What lessthan that could it all have been, in its far-spreading light and itscelestial serenity of multiplication? There it was, there it is, andwhen I think of the dark, foul, stifling Ghettos of other rememberedcities, I shall think by the same stroke of the city of redemption, andevoke in particular the rich Rutgers Street perspectiverich, sopeculiarly, for the eye, in that complexity of fire-escapes with whicheach house-front bristles and which gives the whole vista so modernizedand appointed a look. Omnipresent in the poor regions, this neatapplied machinery has, for the stranger, a common side with the electriclight and the telephone, suggests the distance achieved from the oldJerusalem. (These frontal iron ladders and platforms, by the way, sonumerous throughout New York, strike more New York notes than can beparenthetically namedand among them perhaps most sharply the note ofthe ease with which, in the terrible town, on opportunity,architecture goes by the board; but the appearance to which they oftenmost conduce is that of the spaciously organized cage for the nimblerclass of animals in some great zoological garden. This general analogyis irresistibleit seems to offer, in each district, a little world ofbars and perches and swings for human squirrels and monkeys. The veryname of architecture perishes, for the fire-escapes look like abashedafterthoughts, staircases and communications forgotten in theconstruction; but the inhabitants lead, like the squirrels and monkeys,all the merrier life.) It was while I hung over the prospect from thewindows of my friend, however, the presiding genius of the district, andit was while, at a later hour, I proceeded in his company, and in thatof a trio of contributive fellow-pilgrims, from one characteristicplace of public entertainment to another: it was during this richclimax, I say, that the city of redemption was least to be taken foranything less than it was. The windows, while we sat at meat, looked outon a swarming little square in which an ant-like population darted toand fro; the square consisted in part of a district public garden, orpublic lounge rather, one of those small backwaters or refuges, artfullyeconomized for rest, here and there, in the very heart of the New Yorkwhirlpool, and which spoke louder than anything else of a Jerusalemdisinfected. What spoke loudest, no doubt, was the great overtoweringSchool which formed a main boundary and in the shadow of which we allcomparatively crouched.But the School must not lead me on just yetso colossally has itspresence still to loom for us; that presence which profits so, forpredominance, in America, by the failure of concurrent and competitivepresences, the failure of any others looming at all on the same scalesave that of Business, those in particular of a visible Church, avisible State, a visible Society, a visible Past; those of the manyvisibilities, in short, that warmly cumber the ground in oldercountries. Yet it also spoke loud that my friend was quartered, for theinterest of the thing (from his so interesting point of view), in atenement-house; the New Jerusalem would so have triumphed, had ittriumphed nowhere else, in the fact that this charming little structure_could_ be ranged, on the wonderful little square, under that invidioushead. On my asking to what latent vice it owed its stigma, I was askedin return if it didnt sufficiently pay for its name by harbouring somefive-and-twenty families. But this, exactly, was the way ittestifiedthis circumstance of the simultaneous enjoyment byfive-and-twenty families, on tenement lines, of conditions so littlesordid, so highly evolved. I remember the evolved fire-proofstaircase, a thing of scientific surfaces, impenetrable to the microbe,and above all plated, against side friction, with white marble of agoodly grain. The white marble was surely the New Jerusalem note, and wefollowed that note, up and down the district, the rest of the evening,through more happy changes than I may take time to count. What struck mein the flaring streets (over and beyond the everywhere insistent,defiant, unhumorous, exotic face) was the blaze of the shops addressedto the New Jerusalem wants and the splendour with which these were takenfor granted; the only thing indeed a little ambiguous was just this lookof the trap too brilliantly, too candidly baited for the wary side ofIsrael itself. It is not _for_ Israel, in general, that Israel soartfully shinesyet its being moved to do so, at last, in that luxuriousstyle, might be precisely the grand side of the city of redemption. Whocan ever tell, moreover, in any conditions and in presence of anyapparent anomaly, what the genius of Israel may, or may not, really beup to?The grateful way to take it all, at any rate, was with the sense of itscoming back again to the inveterate rise, in the American air, of everyvalue, and especially of the lower ones, those most subject tomultiplication; such a wealth of meaning did this keep appearing to pourinto the value and function of the country at large. Importances are allstrikingly shifted and reconstituted, in the United States, for thevisitor attuned, from far back, to European importances; but I thinkof no other moment of my total impression as so sharply working over myown benighted vision of them. The scale, in this light of the NewJerusalem, seemed completely rearranged; or, to put it more simply, thewants, the gratifications, the aspirations of the poor, as expressedin the shops (which were the shops of the poor), denoted a new styleof poverty; and this new style of poverty, from street to street, stuckout of the possible purchasers, ones jostling fellow-pedestrians, andmade them, to every man and woman, individual throbs in the largerharmony. One can speak only of what one has seen, and there were grosserelements of the sordid and the squalid that I doubtless never saw. That,with a good deal of observation and of curiosity, I should have failedof this, the country over, affected me as by itself something of anindication. To miss that part of the spectacle, or to know it only byits having so unfamiliar a pitch, was an indication that made up for agreat many others. It is when this one in particular is forced home toyouthis immense, vivid _general_ lift of poverty and generalappreciation of the living units paying property in himselfthat thepicture seems most to clear and the way to jubilation most to open. Forit meets you there, at every turn, as the result most definitelyattested. You are as constantly reminded, no doubt, that these rises inenjoyed value shrink and dwindle under the icy breath of Trusts and theweight of the new remorseless monopolies that operate as no madnesses ofancient personal power thrilling us on the historic page ever operated;the living units property in himself becoming more and more merely sucha property as may consist with a relation to properties overwhelminglygreater and that allow the asking of no questions and the making, forco-existence with them, of no conditions. But that, in the fortunatephrase, is another story, and will be altogether, evidently, a new anddifferent drama. There is such a thing, in the United States, it ishence to be inferred, as freedom to grow up to be blighted, and it maybe the only freedom in store for the smaller fry of future generations.If it is accordingly of the smaller fry I speak, and of how large theymassed on that evening of endless admonitions, this will be because Icaught them thus in their comparative humility and at an early stage oftheir American growth. The life-thread has, I suppose, to be of acertain thickness for the great shears of Fate to feel for it. Put it,at the worst, that the Ogres were to devour them, they were but the morecertainly to fatten into food for the Ogres.Their dream, at all events, as I noted it, was meanwhile sweet andundisguisednowhere sweeter than in the half-dozen picked beer-housesand cafs in which our ingenuous _enqute_, that of my fellow-pilgrimsand I, wound up. These establishments had each been selected for itsplaying off some facet of the jewel, and they wondrously testified, bytheir range and their individual colour, to the spread of that lustre.It was a pious rosary of which I should like to tell each bead, but Imust let the general sense of the adventure serve. Our successivestations were in no case of the seamy order, an inquiry into seaminesshaving been unanimously pronounced futile, but each had its separatesocial connotation, and it was for the number and variety of theseconnotations, and their individual plenitude and prosperity, to set onethinking. Truly the Yiddish world was a vast world, with its own deepsand complexities, and what struck one above all was that it sat there atits cups (and in no instance vulgarly the worse for them) with asublimity of good conscience that took away the breath, a protrusion ofelbow never aggressive, but absolutely proof against jostling. It wasthe incurable man of letters under the skin of one of the party whogasped, I confess; for it was in the light of letters, that is in thelight of our language as literature has hitherto known it, that onestared at this all-unconscious impudence of the agency of future ravage.The man of letters, in the United States, has his own difficulties toface and his own current to stemfor dealing with which his liveliestinspiration may be, I think, that they are still very much his own, evenin an Americanized world, and that more than elsewhere they press him tointimate communion with his honour. For that honour, the honour thatsits astride of the consecrated English tradition, to his mind, quite asold knighthood astride of its caparisoned charger, the dragon mostrousing, over the land, the proper spirit of St. George, is just thisimmensity of the alien presence climbing higher and higher, climbingitself into the very light of publicity.I scarce know why, but I saw it that evening as in some dim dawn of thatpromise to its own consciousness, and perhaps this was precisely whatmade it a little exasperating. Under the impression of the mere mob thequestion doesnt come up, but in these haunts of comparative civility wesaw the mob sifted and strained, and the exasperation was the sharper,no doubt, because what the process had left most visible was just thevarious possibilities of the waiting spring of intelligence. Suchelements constituted the germ of a public, and it was impossible(possessed of a sensibility worth speaking of) to be exposed to themwithout feeling how new a thing under the sun the resulting public wouldbe. That was where ones lettered anguish came inin the turn of oneseye from face to face for some betrayal of a prehensile hook for thelinguistic tradition as one had known it. Each warm lighted and suppliedcircle, each group of served tables and smoked pipes and fostereddecencies and unprecedented accents, beneath the extravagant lamps, tookon thus, for the brooding critic, a likeness to that terrible modernizedand civilized room in the Tower of London, haunted by the shade of GuyFawkes, which had more than once formed part of the scene of thecritics taking tea there. In this chamber of the present urbanities thewretched man had been stretched on the rack, and the critics ear (howelse should it have been a critics?) could still always catch, inpauses of talk, the faint groan of his ghost. Just so the East sidecafsand increasingly as their place in the scale was highershowed tomy inner sense, beneath their bedizenment, as torture-rooms of theliving idiom; the piteous gasp of which at the portent of lacerations tocome could reach me in any drop of the surrounding Accent of the Future.The accent of the very ultimate future, in the States, may be destinedto become the most beautiful on the globe and the very music of humanity(here the ethnic synthesis shrouds itself thicker than ever); butwhatever we shall know it for, certainly, we shall not know it forEnglishin any sense for which there is an existing literary measure.                                   IVThe huge jagged city, it must be nevertheless said, has always at theworst, for propitiation, the resource of its easy reference to itsalmost incomparable river. New York may indeed be jagged, in her longleanness, where she lies looking at the sky in the manner of somecolossal hair-comb turned upward and so deprived of half its teeth thatthe others, at their uneven intervals, count doubly as sharp spikes;but, unmistakably, you can bear with some of her aspects and her airsbetter when you have really taken in that referencewhich I speak of aseasy because she has in this latter time begun to make it with anappearance of some intention. She has come at last, far up on the Westside, into possession of her birthright, into the roused consciousnessthat some possibility of a river-front may still remain to her; though,obviously, a justified pride in this property has yet to await the birthof a more responsible sense of style in her dealings with it, the dawnof some adequate plan or controlling idea. Splendid the elements ofposition, on the part of the new Riverside Drive (over the smallsuburbanizing name of which, as at the effect of a second-rate shop-wornarticle, we sigh as we pass); yet not less irresistible the pang of ourseeing it settle itself on meagre, bourgeois, happy-go-lucky lines. Thepity of this is sharp in proportion as the chance has beenmagnificent, and the soreness of perception of what merely might havebeen is as constant as the flippancy of the little vulgar privatehouses or the big vulgar apartment hotels that are having their ownway, so unchallenged, with the whole question of composition andpicture. The fatal tall pecuniary enterprise rises where it will, inthe candid glee of new worlds to conquer; the intervals between takewhatever foolish little form they like; the sky-line, eternal victim ofthe artless jumble, submits again to the type of the broken hair-combturned up; the streets that abut from the East condescend at theircorners to any crudity or poverty that may suit their convenience. Andall this in presence of an occasion for noble congruity such as onescarce knows where to seek in the case of another great city.A sense of the waste of criticism, however, a sense that is almost initself consoling, descends upon the fond critic after his vision hasfixed the scene awhile in this light of its lost accessibility to someinformed and benevolent despot, some power working in one great way andso that the interest of beauty should have been better saved. Is notcriticism wasted, in other words, just by the reason of the constantremembrance, on New York soil, that one is almost impudently cheated byany part of the show that pretends to prolong its actuality or to reston its present basis? Since every part, however blazingly new, fails toaffect us as doing more than hold the ground for something else, someconceit of the bigger dividend, that is still to come, so we may bind upthe sthetic wound, I think, quite as promptly as we feel it open. Theparticular ugliness, or combination of uglinesses, is no more final thanthe particular felicity (since there are several even of these up anddown the town to be noted), and whatever crudely-extemporized look theRiverside heights may wear to-day, the spectator of fifty years hencewill find his sorrow, if not his joy, in a different extemporization.The whole thing is the vividest of lectures on the subject ofindividualism, and on the strange truth, no doubt, that this principlemay in the field of artat least if the art be architectureoftenconjure away just that mystery of distinction which it sometimes somarkedly promotes in the field of life. It is also quite as suggestiveperhaps on the ever-interesting question, for the artist, of theentirely relative nature and value of treatment. A manner so right inone relation may be so wrong in another, and a house-front so amusingfor its personal note, or its perversity, in a short perspective, mayamid larger elements merely dishonour the harmony. And yet why _should_the charm ever fall out of the personal, which is so often the verycondition of the exquisite? Why should conformity and subordination,that acceptance of control and assent to collectivism in the name ofwhich our age has seen such dreary things done, become on a givenoccasion the one _not_ vulgar way of meeting a problem?Inquiries these, evidently, that are answerable only in presence of theparticular cases provoking them; when indeed they may hold us as under aspell. Endless for instance the sthetic nobleness of such a question asthat of the authority with which the spreading Hudson, at the opening ofits gates, would have imposed on the constructive powers, if listenedto, some proportionate orderwould, in other words, have admirably givenus collectivism at its highest. One has only to stand there and _see_ofsuch value are lessons in authority. But the great vista of the streamalone speaks of itsave in so far at least as the voice is shared, andto so different, to so dreadful a tune, by the grossly-defacing railwaythat clings to the bank. The authority of railways, in the UnitedStates, sits enthroned as none other, and has always, of course, in anyvision of aspects, to be taken into account. Here, at any rate, it isthe rule that has prevailed; the other, the high interest of thepossible picture, is one that lapses; so that the cliffs overhang thewater, and at various points descend to it in green slopes and hollows(where the landscape-gardener does what he can), only to find a wealthof visible baseness installed there before them. That so familiarcircumstance, in America, of the completion of the good thing ironicallyand, as would often seem for the time, insuperably baffled, meets hereone of its liveliest illustrations. It at all events helps to givemeanwhile the mingled pitch of the whole concert that Columbia College(to sound the old and easier name) should have moved upmoved uptwice, if I am not mistakento adorn with an ampler presence this veryneighbourhood. It has taken New York to invent, for the thickening ofclassic shades, the moving University; and does not that quite markthe tune of the dance, of the local unwritten law that forbids almost_any_ planted object to gather in a history where it stands, forbids infact any accumulation that may not be recorded in the mere bank-book?This last became long ago _the_ historic page.It is, however, just because the beauty of the Hudson seems to speak ofother matters, and because the sordid city has the honour, after all, ofsitting there at the Beautiful Gate, that I alluded above to herprofiting in a manner, even from the point of view of taste, by thisclose and fortunate connection. The place puts on thus, not a little,the likeness of a large loose family which has had queer adventures andfallen into vulgar ways, but for which a glorious cousinship never quiterepudiated by the indifferent princely cousin_bon prince_ in this as inother mattersmay still be pleaded. At the rate New York is growing, infine, she will more and more command, in familiar intercourse, thegreat perspective of the River; so that here, a certain point reached,her whole case must change and her general opportunity, swallowing upthe mainland, become a new question altogether. Let me hasten to addthat in the light of this opportunity even the most restless analyst canbut take the hopeful view of her. I fear I am finding too many personalcomparisons for herthan which indeed there can be no greater sign of aconfessed preoccupation; but she figures, once again, as an heir whoseexpectations are so vast and so certain that no temporary sowing of wildoats need be felt to endanger them. As soon as the place begins tospread at ease real responsibility of all sorts will begin, and thegood-natured feeling must surely be that the civic conscience in her, atsuch a stage, will fall into step. Of the spreading woods and watersamid which the future in question appears still half to lurk, thatmainland region of the Bronx, vast above all in possibilities of Park,out of which it already appears half to emerge, I unluckily failed ofoccasion to take the adequate measure. But my confused impression was ofa kind of waiting abundance, an extraordinary quantity of nature, forthe reformed rake, that is the sobered heir, to play with. It is thefashion in the East to speak of New York as poor of environment,unpossessed of the agreeable, accessible countryside that crowns theconvenience not only of London and of Paris, but even, with morehumiliating promptitude, that of Boston, of Philadelphia, of Baltimore.In spite, however, of the memory, from far back, of a hundred marginalMahattanese miseries, an immediate belt of the most sordid character, Icannot but think of this invidious legend as attempting to prove toomuch.The countryside is there, on the most liberal of scalesit is thetownside, only, that, having the great waters and the greater distancesgenerally to deal with, has worn so rude and demoralized a face as tofrighten the country away. And if the townside is now making after thecountryside fast, as I say, and with a little less of the mere roughnessof the satyr pursuing the nymph, what finer warrant could be desiredthan such felicities of position as those enjoyed, on the Riversideheights, by the monument erected to the soldiers and sailors of theCivil War and, even in a greater degree, by the tomb of General Grant?These are verily monumental sites of the first order, and I confessthat, though introduced to them on a bleak winter morning, with noingratiation in any element, I felt the critical question, as to thestructures themselves, as to taste or intention, as to the amount ofinvolved or achieved consecration or profanation, carried off in thegeneral greatness of the effect. I shall in fact always remember thaticy hour, with the temple-crowned headlands, the wide Hudson vista whitewith the cold, all nature armour-plated and grim, as an extraordinarilystrong and simple composition; made stern and kept simple as for somevisit of the God of Battles to his chosen. He might have been ridingthere, on the north wind, to look down at them, and one caught for themoment, the true hard light in which military greatness should be seen.It shone over the miles of ice with its lustre of steel, and if what,thus attested, it makes one think of was its incomparable,indestructible prestige, so that association affected me both then andon a later occasion as with a strange indefinable consequenceaninfluence in which the sthetic consideration, the artistic value ofeither memorial, melted away and became irrelevant. For here, if ever,was a great democratic demonstration caught in the fact, the nakedestpossible effort to strike the note of the august. The tomb of the singlehero in particular presents itself in a manner so opposed to our commonideas of the impressive, to any past vision of sepulchral state, that wecan only wonder if a new kind and degree of solemnity may not have beenarrived at in this complete rupture with old consecrating forms.The tabernacle of Grants ashes stands there by the pleasure-drive,unguarded and unenclosed, the feature of the prospect and the propertyof the people, as open as an hotel or a railway-station to any comingand going, and as dedicated to the public use as builded things inAmerica (when not mere closed churches) only can be. Unmistakable itsair of having had, all consciously, from the first, to raise its headand play its part without pomp and circumstance to back it, withoutmystery or ceremony to protect it, without Church or State to interveneon its behalf, with only its immediacy, its familiarity of interest tocircle it about, and only its proud outlook to preserve, so far aspossible, its character. The tomb of Napoleon at the Invalides is agreat national property, and the play of democratic manners sufficientlysurrounds it; but as compared to the small pavilion on the Riversidebluff it is a holy of holies, a great temple jealously guarded andformally approached. And yet one doesnt conclude, strange to say, thatthe Riverside pavilion fails of its expression a whit more than theParis dome; one perhaps even feels it triumph by its use of its want ofreserve as a very last word. The admonition of all of which possiblyisI confess I but grope for itthat when there has been in such cases acertain other happy combination, an original sincerity of intention, anoriginal propriety of site, and above all an original high value of nameand fame, something in this line really supreme, publicity, familiarity,immediacy, as I have called them, _carried far enough_, may stalk in andout of the shrine with their hands in their pockets and their hats ontheir heads, and yet not dispel the Presence. The question at any rateputs itselfas new questions in America are always putting themselves:Do certain impressions there represent the absolute extinction of oldsensibilities, or do they represent only new forms of them? The inquirywould be doubtless easier to answer if so many of these feelings werenot mainly known to us just _by_ their attendant forms. At this rate, oron such a showing, in the United States, attendant forms being, in everyquarter, remarkably scarce, it would indeed seem that the sentimentsimplied _are_ extinct; for it would be an abuse of ingenuity, I fear, totry to read mere freshness of form into some of the more rank failuresof observance. There are failures of observance that stand, at the best,for failures of sensewhereby, however, the question grows too great.One must leave the tomb of Grant to its conditions and its future withthe simple note for it that if it be not in fact one of the mosteffective of commemorations it is one of the most missed. On the whole Idistinctly liked it.                                   VIt is still vivid to me that, returning in the spring-time from a fewweeks in the Far West, I re-entered New York State with the absurdestsense of meeting again a ripe old civilization and travelling through acountry that showed the mark of established manners. It will seem, Ifear, ones perpetual refrain, but the moral was yet once more thatvalues of a certain order are, in such conditions, all relative, andthat, as some wants of the spirit _must_ somehow be met, one knockstogether any substitute that will fairly stay the appetite. We hadpassed great smoky Buffalo in the raw vernal dawnwith a vision, for me,of curiosity, character, charm, whatever it might be, too needfullysacrificed, opportunity perhaps forever missed, yet at the same time avision in which the lost object failed to mock at me with the lastconcentration of shape; and history, as we moved Eastward, appeared tomeet us, in the look of the land, in its more overwrought surface andthicker detail, quite as if she had ever consciously declined to crossthe border and were aware, precisely, of the queer feast we should findin her. The recognition, I profess, was a preposterous ecstasy: onecouldnt have felt more if one had passed into the presence of someseated, placid, rich-voiced gentlewoman after leaving that of an honestbut boisterous hoyden. It was doubtless a matter only of degrees andshades, but never was such a pointing of the lesson that a sign of anysort may count double if it be but artfully placed. I spent that day,literally, in the company of the rich-voiced gentlewoman, making myprofit of it even in spite of a second privation, the doom I was underof having only, all wistfully, all ruefully, to avert my lips from thequaint silver bowl, as I here quite definitely figured it, in which sheoffered me the entertainment of antique Albany. At antique Albany, to acertainty, the mature matron involved in my metaphor would have put on aparticular grace, and as our train crossed the river for furtherprogress I almost seemed to see her stand at some gable-window of Dutchassociation, one of the two or three impressed there on my infantileimagination, to ask me why then I had come so far at all.I could have replied but in troubled tones, and I looked at the rest ofthe scene for some time, no doubt, as through the glaze of all butfilial tears. Thus it was, possibly, that I saw the River shine, fromthat moment on, as a great romantic stream, such as could throw not alittle of its glamour, for the mood of that particular hour, over thecity at its mouth. I had not even known, in my untravelled state, thatwe were to strike it on our way from Chicago, so that it represented,all that afternoon, so much beauty thrown in, so much benefit beyond thebargainthe so hard bargain, for the traveller, of the Americanrailway-journey at its best. That ordeal was in any case at its besthere, and the perpetually interesting river kept its course, by my rightelbow, with such splendid consistency that, as I recall the impression,I repent a little of having just now reflected with acrimony on the costof the obtrusion of track and stations to the Riverside view. One mustof course choose between dispensing with the ugly presence and enjoyingthe scenery by the aid of the samewhich but means, really, that to usethe train at all had been to put ones self, for any proper justice tothe scenery, in a false position. That, however, takes us too far back,and one can only save ones dignity by laying all such blames on ourdetestable age. A decent respect for the Hudson would confine us to theuse of the boatall the more that American river-steamers have had, fromthe earliest time, for the true _raffin_, their peculiar note ofromance. A possible commerce, on the other hand, with ones timewhichis always also the time of so many other busy peoplehas long since mademincemeat of the rights of contemplation; rights as reduced, in theUnited States, to-day, and by quite the same argument, as those of thenoble savage whom we have banished to his narrowing reservation. Lettingthat pass, at all events, I still remember that I was able to put, fromthe car-window, as many questions to the scene as it could have answeredin the time even had its face been clearer to read.Its face was veiled, for the most part, in a mist of premature springheat, an atmosphere draping it indeed in luminous mystery, hanging itabout with sun-shot silver and minimizing any happy detail, any elementof the definite, from which the romantic effect might here and therehave gained an accent. There was not an accent in the picture from thebeginning of the run to Albany to the endfor which thank goodness! oneis tempted to say on remembering how often, over the land in general,the accents are wrong. Yet if the romantic effect as we know itelsewhere mostly depends on them, why _should_ that glamour have soshimmered before me in their absence?how should the picture havemanaged to be a constant combination of felicities? Was it just_because_ the felicities were all vaguenesses, and the beauties, eventhe most celebrated, all blurs?was it perchance on that very accountthat I could meet my wonder so promptly with the inference that what Ihad in my eyes on so magnificent a scale was simply, was famously,style? I was landed by that conclusion in the odd further propositionthat style could then exist without accentsa quandary soon after to bequenched, however, in the mere blinding radiance of a visit to WestPoint. I was to make that memorable pilgrimage a fortnight laterand Iwas to find my question, when it in fact took place, shivered by it tomere silver atoms. The very powers of the air seemed to have taken thecase in hand and positively to have been interested in making ittranscend all argument. Our Sunday of mid-May, wet and windy, let loose,over the vast stage, the whole procession of storm-effects; the rawgreen of wooded heights and hollows was only everywhere rain-brightened,the weather playing over it all day as with some great grey water-colourbrush. The essential character of West Point and its native nobleness ofposition can have been but intensified, I think, by this artful process;yet what was mainly unmistakable was the fact again of the suppressionof detail as in the positive interest of the grand style. One hadtherefore only to take detail as another name for accent, the accentthat might prove compromising, in order to see it made good that style_could_ do without them, and that the grand style in fact almost alwaysmust. How on this occasion the trick was played is more than I shallattempt to say; it is enough to have been conscious of our being, fromhour to hour, literally bathed in that high element, with the very faceof nature washed, so to speak, the more clearly to express and utter it.Such accordingly is the strong silver light, all simplifying andennobling, in which I see West Point; see it as a cluster of highpromontories, of the last classic elegance, overhanging vast recedingreaches of river, mountain-guarded and dim, which took their place inthe geography of the ideal, in the long perspective of the poetry ofassociation, rather than in those of the State of New York. It was as ifthe genius of the scene had said: No, you _shant_ have accent, becauseaccent is, at the best, local and special, and might here by someperversityhow do I know after all?interfere. I want you to havesomething unforgettable, and therefore you shall have _type_yes,absolutely have type, and even tone, without accent; an impossibility,you may hitherto have supposed, but which you have only to look aboutyou now really to see expressed. And type and tone of the very finestand rarest; type and tone good enough for Claude or Turner, if theycould have walked by these rivers instead of by their thin rivers ofFrance and Italy; type and tone, in short, that gather in shy detailunder wings as wide as those with which a motherly hen covers herendangered brood. So there you aredeprived of all accent as a peg forcriticism, and reduced thereby, you see, to asking me no morequestions. I was able so to take home, I may add, this formula of thematter, that even the interesting facts of the School of the Soldierwhich have carried the name of the place about the world almost put onthe shyness, the air of conscious evasion and escape, noted in the aboveallocution: they struck me as forsaking the foreground of the picture.It was part of the play again, no doubt, of the grey water-colour brush:there was to be no consent of the elements, that day, to anything but ageneralized elegancein which effect certainly the clustered, thescattered Academy played, on its high green stage, its part. But, of allthings in the world, it massed, to my vision, more mildly than I hadsomehow expected; and I take that for a feature, precisely, of the purepoetry of the impression. It lurked there with grace, it insistedwithout swaggerand I could have hailed it just for this reason indeedas a presence of the last distinction. It is doubtless too much to say,in fine, that the Institution, at West Point, suffers comparatively,for vulgar individual emphasis, from the overwhelming liberality of itssettingand I perhaps chanced to see it in the very conditions that mostinvest it with poetry. The fact remains that, both as to essence and asto quantity, its prose seemed washed away, and I shall recall it in thefuture much less as the sternest, the world over, of all the seats ofDiscipline, than as some great Corot-composition of young, vague,wandering figures in splendidly-classic shades.                                   VII make that point, for what it is worth, only to remind myself ofanother occasion on which the romantic note sounded for me with the lastintensity, and yet on which the picture swarmed with accentsas, absentor present, I must again call themthat contributed alike to itsinterest and to its dignity. The proof was complete, on this secondSunday, with the glow of early summer already in possession, thataffirmed detail was not always affirmed infelicitysince the scene herebristled with detail (and detail of the importance that frankly_constitutes_ accent) only to the enhancement of its charm. It was amatter once more of hanging over the Hudson on the side opposite WestPoint, but further down; the situation was founded, as at West Point, onthe presence of the great feature and on the consequent general lift offoreground and distance alike, and yet infinitely sweet was it to gatherthat style, in such conditions and for the success of such effects, hadnot really to depend on mere kind vaguenesses, on any anxiousdeprecation of distinctness. There was no vagueness now; a wealth ofdistinctness, in the splendid light, met the eyesbut with the veryresult of showing them how happily it could play. What it came back towas that the accents, in the delightful old pillared and porticoed housethat crowned the cliff and commanded the stream, were as right as theywere numerous; so that there immediately followed again on thisobservation a lively recognition of the ground of the rightness. Towonder what this was could be but to see, straightway, that, though manyreasons had worked together for them, mere time had done more than all;that beneficence of time enjoying in general, in the United States, solittle even of the chance that so admirably justifies itself, for themost part, when interference happens to have spared it. Cases of thisrare mercy yet exist, as I had had occasion to note, and theirconsequent appeal to the touched sense within us comes, as I have alsohinted, with a force out of all proportion, comes with a kind ofaccepted insolence of authority. The things that have lasted, in short,whatever they may be, succeed as no newness, try as it will, succeeds,inasmuch as their success is a created interest.There we catch the golden truth which so much of the American worldstrikes us as positively organized to gainsay, the truth that productiontakes time, and that the production of interest, in particular, takes_most_ time. Desperate again and again the ingenuity of the offered, theobtruded substitute, and pathetic in many an instance its confessedfailure; this remark being meanwhile relevant to the fact that mycharming old historic house of the golden Sunday put me off, among itsgreat trees, its goodly gardens, its acquired signs and gatheredmemories, with no substitute whatever, even the most specious, but justpaid cash down, so to speak, ripe ringing gold, over the counter, forall the attention it invited. It had character, as one might say, andcharacter is scarce less precious on the part of the homes of men in araw medium than on the part of responsible persons at a difficultcrisis. This virtue was there within and without and on every face; butperhaps nowhere so present, I thought, as in the ideal refuge for summerdays formed by the wide north porch, if porch that disposition may becalledhappiest disposition of the old American country-housewhich setstall columns in a row, under a pediment suitably severe, to present themas the making of a high, deep gallery. I know not what dignity of oldafternoons suffused with what languor seems to me always, under themurmur of American trees and by the lap of American streams, to abide inthese mild shades; there are combinations with depths of congruitybeyond the plummet, it would seem, even of the most restless ofanalysts, and rather than try to say why my whole impression here meltedinto the general iridescence of a past of Indian summers hanging aboutmild ghosts half asleep, in hammocks, over still milder novels, I wouldrenounce altogether the art of refining. For the iridescence consists,in this connection, of a shimmer of association that still more refusesto be reduced to terms; some sense of legend, of aboriginal mystery,with a still earlier past for its dim background and the insistent ideaof the River as above all romantic for its warrant. Helplessly analyzed,perhaps, this amounts to no more than the very childish experience of agalleried house or two round about which the views and the trees and thepeaches and the pony seemed prodigious, and to the remembrance of whichthe wonder of Rip Van Winkle and that of the Hudson River School oflandscape art were, a little later on, to contribute their glamour.If Rip Van Winkle had been really at the bottom of it all, nothing couldhave furthered the whole case more, on the occasion I speak of, than thehappy nearness of the home of Washington Irving, the impression of whichI was thus able, in the course of an hour, to work inwith the effect ofintensifying more than I can say the old-time charm and the generallegendary fusion. These are beautiful, delicate, modest matters, and howcan one touch them with a light enough hand? How can I give thecomparatively coarse reasons for my finding at Sunnyside, whichcontrives, by some grace of its own, to be at once all ensconced andembowered in relation to the world, and all frank and uplifted inrelation to the river, a perfect treasure of mild moralities? Thehighway, the old State road to Albany, bristling now with thecloud-compelling motor, passes at the head of a deep, long lane,winding, embanked, overarched, such an old-world lane as one scarce evermeets in America; but if you embrace this chance to plunge away to theleft you come out for your reward into the quite indefinable air of thelittle American literary past. The place is inevitably, to-day, but aqualified Sleepy Hollowthe Sleepy Hollow of the authors charmingimagination was, as I take it, off somewhere in the hills, or in somedreamland of old autumns, happily unprofanable now; for modernity,with its terrible power of working its will, of abounding in its sense,of gilding its toymodernity, with its pockets full of money and itsconscience full of virtue, its heart really full of tenderness, hasseated itself there under pretext of guarding the shrine. What hashappened, in a word, is very much what has happened in the case of othershy retreats of anchorites doomed to celebritythe primitive cell hasseen itself encompassed, in time, by a temple of many chambers, alldedicated to the history of the hermit. The cell is still there atSunnyside, and there is even yet so much charm that one doesnt attemptto say where the parts of it, all kept together in a rich conciliatoryway, begin or endthough indeed, I hasten to add, the identity of theoriginal modest house, the shrine within the gilded shell, has beenreligiously preserved.One has, in fact, I think, no quarrel whatever with the amplified stateof the place, for it is the manner and the effect of this amplificationthat enable us to read into the scene its very most interesting message.The little American literary past, I just now saidusing thatword(whatever the real size of the subject) because the caressingdiminutive, at Sunnyside, is what rises of itself to the lips; the smalluncommodious study, the limited library, the dear old portrait-printsof the first half of the centuryvery dear to-day when properly signedand properly sallowthese things, with the beauty of the site, with thesense that the man of letters of the unimproved age, the age ofprocesses still comparatively slow, could have wanted no deeper, softerdell for mulling material over, represent the conditions that encounternow on the spot the sharp reflection of our own increase of arrangementand loss of leisure. This is the admirable interest of the exhibition ofwhich Wolferts Roost had been, a hundred years before the date ofIrvings purchase, the rudimentary principlethat it throws the facts ofour earlier intellectual activity into a vague golden perspective, ahaze as of some unbroken spell of the same Indian summer I a moment agohad occasion to help myself out with; a fond appearance than whichnothing could minister more to envy. If we envy the spinners of proseand tellers of tales to whom our American air anciently eitheradministered or refused sustenance, this is all, and quite the bestthing, it would seem, that we need do for them: it exhausts, or ratherit forestalls, the futilities of discrimination. Strictly critical,mooning about Wolferts Roost of a summer Sunday, I defy even thehungriest of analysts to be: his predecessors, the whole connectedcompany, profit so there, to his rueful vision, by the splendour oftheir possession of better conditions than his. It has taken _our_ uglyera to thrust in the railroad at the foot of the slope, among themasking trees; the railroad that is part, exactly, of the pomp andcircumstance, the quickened pace, the heightened fever, the narrowedmargin expressed within the very frame of the present picture, as I say,and all in the perfect good faith of collateral piety. I had hoped notto have to name the railroadit seems so to give away my case. There wasno railroad, however, till long after Irvings settlementhe survivedthe railroad but by a few years, and my case is simply that, disengaging_his_ Sunnyside from its beautiful extensions and arriving thus at thesense of his easy elements, easy for everything but rushing about andbeing rushed at, the sense of his command of the admirable river andthe admirable country, his command of all the mildness of his life, ofhis pleasant powers and his ample hours, of his friends and hiscontemporaries and his fame and his honour and his temper and, aboveall, of his delightful fund of reminiscence and material, I seemed tohear, in the summer sounds and in the very urbanity of my entertainers,the last faint echo of a felicity forever gone. That is the true voiceof such places, and not the imputed challenge to the chronicler or thecritic.                                   IV                                NEW YORK                              SOCIAL NOTES                                   IWere I not afraid of appearing to strike to excess the so-calledpessimistic note, I should really make much of the interesting,appealing, touching vision of wasteI know not how else to name itthatflung its odd melancholy mantle even over ones walks through the partsof the town supposedly noblest and fairest. For it proceeded, thevision, I think, from a source or two still deeper than the mostobvious, the constant shocked sense of houses and rows, of recentexpensive construction (that had cost thought as well as money, that hadtaken birth presumably as a _serious_ demonstration, and that werethereby just beginning to live into history) marked for removal, forextinction, in their prime, and awaiting it with their handsome faces sofresh and yet so wan and so anxious. The most tragic element in theFrench Revolution, and thence surely the most tragic in human annals,was the so frequent case of the very young sent to the scaffoldtheyouths and maidens, all bewildered and stainless, lately born into aworld decked for them socially with flowers, and for whom, none the lesssuddenly, the horror of horrors uprose. They were literally the victimsI thought of, absurd as it may seem, under the shock in question; inspite of which, however, even this is not what I mean by my impressionof the squandered effort. I have had occasion to speakand one can onlyspeak with sympathyof the really human, the communicative, side of thatvivid show of a society trying to build itself, with every elaboration,into some coherent sense _of_ itself, and literally putting forthinterrogative feelers, as it goes, into the ambient air; literallyreaching out (to the charmed beholder, say) for some measure and sometest of its success. This effect of certain of the manifestations ofwealth in New York is, so far as I know, unique; nowhere else doespecuniary power so beat its wings in the void, and so look round it forthe charity of some hint as to the possible awkwardness or possiblegrace of its motion, some sign of whether it be flying, for good taste,too high or too low. In the other American cities, on the one hand, theflights are as yet less numerousthough already promising no smalldiversion; and amid the older congregations of men, in theproportionately rich cities of Europe, on the other hand, good taste ispresent, for reference and comparison, in a hundred embodied andconsecrated forms. Which is why, to repeat, I found myself recognizingin the New York predicament a particular character and a particularpathos. The whole costly up-town demonstration was a record, in the lastanalysis, of individual loneliness; whence came, precisely, itsinsistent testimony to wastewaste of the still wider sort than the meregame of rebuilding.That quite different admonition of the general European spectacle, theeffect, in the picture of things, as of a large, consummate economy,traditionally practised, springs from the fact that old societies, old,and even new, aristocracies, are arranged exactly to supply functions,forms, the whole element of custom and perpetuity, to any massiveness ofprivate ease, however great. Massive private ease attended with no forceof assertion beyond the hour is an anomaly rarely encountered,therefore, in countries where the social arrangements strike one asundertaking, by their very nature and pretension, to make the future asinteresting as the past. These conditions, the romantic ones for thepicture-seeker, are generally menaced, one is reminded; they tend toalter everywhere, partly by the very force of the American example, andit may be said that in France, for instance, they have done nothing butalter for a hundred years. It none the less remains true that for oncethat we ask ourselves in Europe what is going to become of a givenpiece of property, whether family situation, or else palace, castle,picture, _parure_, other attribute of wealth, we indulge in the questiontwenty times in the United Statesso scant an engagement does thevisible order strike us as taking to provide for it. _There_ comes inthe note of loneliness on the part of these loose valuesdeep as thelook in the eyes of dogs who plead against a change of masters. Thevisible order among ourselves undertakes at the most that they shallchange hands, and the meagreness and indignity of this doom affect themas a betrayal just in proportion as they have grown great. UppermostFifth Avenue, for example, is lined with dwellings the very intentionboth of the spread and of the finish of which would seem to be to implythat they are entailed as majestically as red tape can entail them.But we know how little they enjoy any such courtesy or security; and,but for our tender heart and our charming imagination, we would blightthem in their bloom with our restless analysis. Its all very well foryou to look as if, since youve had no past, youre going in, as thenext best thing, for a magnificent compensatory future. What are yougoing to make your future _of_, for all your airs, we want to know?whatelements of a future, as futures have gone in the great world, are atall assured to you? Do what you will, you sit here only in the luridlight of business, and you know, without our reminding you, whatguarantees, what majestic continuity and heredity, that represents.Where are not only your eldest son and _his_ eldest son, those primeindispensables for any real projection of your estate, unable as theywould be to get rid of you even if they should wish; but where even isthe old family stocking, properly stuffed and hanging so heavy as not tostir, some dreadful day, in the cold breath of Wall Street? No, what youare reduced to for importance is the present, pure and simple,squaring itself between an absent future and an absent past as solidlyas it can. You overdo it for what you areyou overdo it still more forwhat you may be; and dont pretend, above all, with the object-lessonsupplied you, close at hand, by the queer case of Newport, dontpretend, we say, not to know what we mean.We say, I put it, but the point is that we say nothing, and it is thatvery small matter of Newport exactly that keeps us compassionatelysilent. The present state of Newport shall be a chapter by itself, whichI long to take in hand, but which must wait its turn; so that I maymention it here only for the supreme support it gives to this reading ofthe conditions of New York opulence. The show of the case to-dayoh, sovividly and pathetically!is that New York and other opulence, creatingthe place, for a series of years, as part of the effort of Americansociety to find out, by experiment, what it would be at, now has nofurther use for ithas only learned from it, at an immense expenditure,how to get rid of an illusion. Weve found out, after all (since its aquestion of what we would be at), that we wouldnt be at Newportif wecan possibly be anywhere else; which, with our means, we indubitably_can_ be: so that we leave poor dear Newport just ruefully to show it.That remark is written now over the face of the scene, and I can thinknowhere of a mistake confessed to so promptly, yet in terms soexquisite, so charmingly cynical; the terms of beautiful houses anddelicate grounds closed, condemned and forsaken, yet so kept up, atthe same time, as to cover the retreat of their projectors. The very airand light, soft and discreet, seem to speak, in tactful fashion, forpeople who would be embarrassed to be thereas if it might shame them tosee it proved against them that they could once have been so artless andso bourgeois. The point is that they have learned not to be by therather terrible process of exhausting the list of mistakes. Newport, forthemof for us othersis only one of these mistakes; and we feel noconfidence that the pompous New York houses, most of them so flagrantlytentative, and tentative only, bristling with friezes and pinnacles, butdiscernibly deficient in reasons, shall not collectively form another.It is the hard fate of new aristocracies that the element of error, withthem, has to be contemporarynot relegated to the dimness of the past,but receiving the full modern glare, a light fatal to the fond theorythat the best society, everywhere, has grown, in all sorts of ways, inspite of itself. We see it in New York trying, trying its very hardest,to grow, not yet knowing (by so many indications) what to grow _on_.There comes back to me again and again, for many reasons, a particularimpression of this interesting struggle in the voida constituted imageof the upper social organism floundering there all helplessly, more orless floated by its immense good-will and the splendour of its immediateenvironment, but betrayed by its paucity of real resource. The occasionI allude to was simply a dinner-party, of the most genial intention, butat which the note of high ornament, of the general uplifted situation,was so consistently struck that it presented itself, on the page of NewYork life, as a purple patch without a possible contextas consciously,almost painfully, unaccompanied by passages in anything like the samekey. The scene of our feast was a palace and the perfection of settingand service absolute; the ladies, beautiful, gracious and glitteringwith gems, were in tiaras and a semblance of court-trains, a sort ofprescribed official magnificence; but it was impossible not to ask onesself with what, in the wide American frame, such great matters might besupposed to consort or to rhyme. The material pitch was so high that itcarried with it really no social sequence, no application, and that, asa tribute to the ideal, to the exquisite, it wanted company, support,some sort of consecration. The difficulty, the irony, of the hour wasthat so many of the implications of completeness, that is, of asustaining social order, were absent. There was nothing for us to do ateleven oclockor for the ladies at leastbut to scatter and go to bed.There was nothing, as in London or in Paris, to go on to; the goingon is, for the New York aspiration, always the stumbling-block. Agreat court-function would alone have met the strain, met the terms ofthe casewould alone properly have crowned the hour. When I speak of theterms of the case I must remind myself indeed that they were not all ofone complexion; which is but another sign, however, of the inevitablejaggedness of the purple patch in great commercial democracies. The highcolour required could be drawn in abundance from the ladies, but in avery minor degree, one easily perceived, from the men. The impressionwas singular, but it was there: had there been a court-function theladies must have gone on to it alone, trusting to have the properpartners and mates supplied them on the premisessupplied, say, with thechecks for recovery of their cloaks. The high pitch, all the exaltedreference, was of the palatial house, the would-be harmonious women, thetiaras and the trains; it was not of the amiable gentlemen, delightfulin their way, in whose so often quaint presence, yet without whoseimmediate aid, the effort of American society to arrive at the bestconsciousness still goes forward.This failure of the sexes to keep step socially is to be noted, in theUnited States, at every turn, and is perhaps more suggestive ofinteresting drama, as I have already hinted, than anything else in thecountry. But it illustrates further that foredoomed _grope_ of wealth,in the conquest of the amenitiesthe strange necessity under which thesocial interest labours of finding out for itself, as a preliminary,what civilization really _is_. If the men are not to be taken ascontributing to it, but only the women, what new case is _that_, underthe sun, and under what strange aggravations of difficulty therefore isthe problem not presented? We should call any such treatment of adifferent order of question the empirical treatmentthe limitations andaberrations of which crop up, for the restless analyst, in the mostillustrative way. Its presence is felt unmistakably, for instance, inthe general extravagant insistence on the Opera, which plays its part asthe great vessel of social salvation, the comprehensive substitute forall other conceivable vessels; the _whole_ social consciousness thusclambering into it, under stress, as the whole community crams into theother public receptacles, the desperate cars of the Subway or the vastelevators of the tall buildings. The Opera, indeed, as New York enjoysit, one promptly perceives, is worthy, musically and picturesquely, ofits immense function; the effect of it is splendid, but one has none theless the oddest sense of hearing it, as an institution, groan and creak,positively almost split and crack, with the extra weight thrown uponitthe weight that in worlds otherwise arranged is artfully scattered,distributed over all the ground. In default of a court-function ourladies of the tiaras and court-trains might have gone on to theopera-function, these occasions offering the only approach to theimplication of the tiara known, so to speak, to the American law. Yeteven here there would have been no one for them, in congruity andconsistency, to curtsey totheir only possible course becoming thus, itwould seem, to make obeisance, clingingly, to each other. This truthpoints again the effect of a picture poor in the male presence; for towhat male presence of native growth is it thinkable that the wearer ofan American tiara _should_ curtsey? Such a vision gives the measure ofthe degree in which we see the social empiricism in question putting,perforce, the cart before the horse. In worlds otherwise arranged,besides there being always plenty of subjects for genuflection, theoccasion itself, with its character fully turned on, produces the tiara.In New York this symbol has, by an arduous extension of its virtue, toproduce the occasion.                                   III found it interesting to note, furthermore, that the very Clubs, onwhose behalf, if anywhere, expert tradition might have operated,betrayed with a _bonhomie_ touching in the midst of their magnificencethe empirical character. Was not their admirable, their unique,hospitality, for that matter, an empirical notea departure from theconsecrated collective egoism governing such institutions in worlds, asI have said, otherwise arranged? Let the hospitality in this case atleast stand for the prospective discovery of a new and better law, underwhich the consecrated egoism itself will have become the provincialsign. Endless, at all events, the power of one or two of these splendidstructures to testify to the state of mannersof mannersundiscourageably seeking the superior stable equilibrium. There hadremained with me as illuminating, from years before, the confidentialword of a friend on whom, after a long absence from New York, theprivilege of one of the largest clubs had been conferred. The place isa palace, for scale and decoration, but there is only one kind ofletter-paper. There would be more kinds of letter-paper now, I takeitthough the American club struck me everywhere, oddly, considering thebusy people who employ it, as much less an institution for attending toones correspondence than others I had had knowledge of; generallydestitute, in fact, of copious and various appliances for that purpose.There is such a thing as the imagination of the writing-table, and Inowhere, save in a few private houses, came upon its fruits; to which Imust add that this is the one connection in which the provision for easehas not an extraordinary amplitude, an amplitude unequalled anywhereelse. One emphatic reservation, throughout the country, the restoredabsentee finds himself continually making, but the universal custom ofthe house with almost no one of its indoor parts distinguishable fromany other is an affliction against which he has to learn betimes tobrace himself. This diffused vagueness of separation between apartments,between hall and room, between one room and another, between the one youare in and the one you are not in, between place of passage and place ofprivacy, is a provocation to despair which the public institution sharesimpartially with the luxurious home. To the spirit attuned to adifferent practice these dispositions can only appear a strangeperversity, an extravagant aberration of taste; but I may here touch onthem scarce further than to mark their value for the characterization ofmanners.They testify at every turn, then, to those of the American people, tothe prevailing conception of life; they correspond, within doors, tothe as inveterate suppression of almost every outward exclusoryarrangement. The instinct is throughout, as we catch it at play, that ofminimizing, for any interior, the guilt or odium or responsibility,whatever these may appear, of its _being_ an interior. The custom rageslike a conspiracy for nipping the interior in the bud, for denying itsright to exist, for ignoring and defeating it in every possible way, forwiping out successively each sign by which it may be known from anexterior. The effacement of the difference has been marvellously,triumphantly brought about; and, with all the ingenuity of young, fresh,frolicsome architecture aiding and abetting, has been made to flourish,alike in the small structure and the great, as the very law of thestructural fact. Thus we have the law fulfilled that every part of everyhouse shall be, as nearly as may be, visible, visitable, penetrable, notonly from every other part, but from as many parts of as many otherhouses as possible, if they only be near enough. Thus we seesystematized the indefinite extension of all spaces and the definitemerging of all functions; the enlargement of every opening, theexaggeration of every passage, the substitution of gaping arches and farperspectives and resounding voids for enclosing walls, for practicabledoors, for controllable windows, for all the rest of the essence of theroom-character, that room-suggestion which is so indispensable not onlyto occupation and concentration, but to conversation itself, to the playof the social relation at any other pitch than the pitch of a shriek ora shout. This comprehensive canon has so succeeded in imposing itselfthat it strikes you as reflecting inordinately, as positively servingyou up for convenient inspection, under a clear glass cover, the socialtone that has dictated it. But I must confine myself to recording, forthe moment, that it takes a whole new discipline to put the visitor athis ease in so merciless a medium; he finds himself looking round for abackground or a limit, some localizing fact or two, in the interest oftalk, of that good talk which always falters before the completeproscription of privacy. He sees only doorless apertures, vainlyfestooned, which decline to tell him where he is, which make him still ahomeless wanderer, which show him other apertures, corridors,staircases, yawning, expanding, ascending, descending, and all as forthe purpose of giving his presence away, of reminding him that what hesays must be said for the house. He is beguiled in a measure by readinginto these phenomena, ever so sharply, the reason of many anotherimpression; he is beguiled by remembering how many of the things said inAmerica _are_ said for the house; so that if all that he wants is tokeep catching the finer harmony of effect and cause, of explanation andimplication, the cup of his perception is full to overflowing.That satisfaction does represent, certainly, much of his quest; all themore that what he misses, in the placethe comfort and support, forinstance, of windows, porches, verandahs, lawns, gardens, grounds,that, by not taking the whole world into their confidence, have not thewhole worlds confidence to take in returnranges itself for him in thatlarge mass of American idiosyncrasy which contains, unmistakably, aprecious principle of future reaction. The desire to rake and be rakedhas doubtless, he makes out, a long day before it still; but there aretoo many reasons why it should not be the last word of _any_ socialevolution. The social idea has too inevitably secrets in store, quiteother constructive principles, quite other refinements on the idea ofintercourse, with which it must eventually reckon. It will be certain ata given moment, I think, to head in a different direction altogether;though obviously many other remarkable things, changes of ideal, ofhabit, of key, will have to take place first. The conception of thehome, and _a fortiori_ of the club, as a combination of the hall ofechoes and the toy transparency held against the light, will meanwhilesufficiently prevail to have made my reference to it not quite futile.Yet I must after all remember that the reservation on the ground ofcomfort to which I just alluded applies with its smallest force to theinterchangeability of club compartments, to the omnipresence of themajestic open arch in club conditions. Such conditions more or lessprescribe that feature, and criticism begins only when private housesemulate the form of clubs. What I had mainly in mind was another ofthese so inexhaustible values of my subject; with which the question ofrigour of comfort has nothing to do. I cherish certain rememberedaspects for their general vivid eloquencefor the sake of my impressionof the type of great generous club-establishments in which theempiricism of that already-observed idea of the conquest of splendourcould richly and irresponsibly flower. It is of extreme interest to bereminded, at many a turn of such an exhibition, that it takes an endlessamount of history to make even a little tradition, and an endless amountof tradition to make even a little taste, and an endless amount oftaste, by the same token, to make even a little tranquillity.Tranquillity results largely from taste tactfully applied, taste lightedabove all by experience and possessed of a clue for its labyrinth. Thereis no such clue, for club-felicity, as some view of congruities andharmonies, completeness of correspondence between aspects and uses. Asense for that completeness is a thing of slow growth, one of theflowers of tradition precisely; of the good conservative tradition thatwalks apart from the extravagant use of money and the unregulated appealto stylepasses in fact, at its best, quite on the other side of theway. This discrimination occurs when the ground has the good fortune tobe already held by some definite, some transmitted conception of theadornments and enhancements that consort, and that do not consort, withthe presence, the habits, the tone, of lounging, gossiping, smoking,newspaper-reading, bridge-playing, cocktail-imbibing men. Theclub-developments of New York read here and there the lesson of thestrange deserts in which the appeal to style may lose itself, may wildlyand wantonly stray, without a certain light of the fine old gentlemanlyprejudice to guide it.                                  IIIBut I should omit half my small story were I not meanwhile to make duerecord of the numerous hours at which one ceased consciously todiscriminate, just suffering ones sense to be flooded with the largeclean light and with that suggestion of a crowded party of youngpersons which lurked in the general aspect of the handsomer regionsagreat circle of brilliant and dowered _dbutantes_ and impatient youths,expert in the cotillon, waiting together for the first bars of somewonderful imminent dance-music, something wilder than any ever yet. Itis such a wait for something more, these innocents scarce know what, itis this, distinctly, that the upper New York picture seems to cause toplay before us; but the wait is just that collective alertness ofbright-eyed, light-limbed, clear-voiced youth, without a doubt in theworld and without a conviction; which last, however, always, mayperfectly be absent without prejudice to confidence. The confidence andthe innocence are those of children whose world has ever beenpractically a safe one, and the party so imaged is thus really even achilds party, enormously attended, but in which the united ages of thecompany make up no formidable sum. In the light of that analogy the NewYork social movement of the day, I think, always shinesas the wholeshow of the so-called social life of the country does, for that matter;since it comes home to the restless analyst everywhere that thischildish explanation is the one that meets the greatest number of thesocial appearances. To arriveand with tolerable promptitudeat thatgeneralization is to find it, right and left, immensely convenient, andthereby quite to cling to it: the newspapers alone, for instance, doingso much to feed it, from day to day, as with their huge playfullybrandished wooden spoon. We seem at moments to see the incoherence andvolatility of childhood, its living but in the sense of its hour and inthe immediacy of its want, its instinctive refusal to be brought tobook, its boundless liability to contagion and boundless incapacity forattention, its ingenuous blankness to-day over the appetites andclamours of yesterday, its chronic state of besprinklement with thesawdust of its ripped-up dolls, which it scarce goes even through theform of shaking out of its hairwe seem at moments to see these things,I say, twinkle in the very air, as by reflection of the movement of agreat, sunny playroom floor. The immensity of the native accommodation,socially speaking, for the childish life, is not that exactly the key ofmuch of the spectacle?the safety of the vast flat expanse where everymargin abounds and nothing too untoward need happen. The question isinteresting, but I remember quickly that I am concerned with it only sofar as it is part of the light of New York.It appeared at all events, on the late days of spring, just a responseto the facility of things, and to much of their juvenile pleasantry, tofind ones self liking, without more ado, and very much even at therisk of ones life, the heterogeneous, miscellaneous apology for aSquare marking the spot at which the main entrance, as I suppose it maybe called, to the Park opens toward Fifth Avenue; opens toward theglittering monument to Sherman, toward the most death-dealing, perhaps,of all the climaxes of electric car cross-currents, toward the loosestof all the loose distributions of the overtopping apartment and otherhotel, toward the most jovial of all the sacrifices of preconsideredcomposition, toward the finest of all the reckless revelations, inshort, of the brave New York humour. The best thing in the picture,obviously, is Saint-Gaudenss great group, splendid in its goldenelegance and doing more for the scene (by thus giving the beholder apoint of such dignity for his orientation) than all its other elementstogether. Strange and seductive for any lover of the reasons of thingsthis inordinate value, on the spot, of the dauntless refinement of theSherman image; the comparative vulgarity of the environment drinking itup, on one side, like an insatiable sponge, and yet failing at the sametime sensibly to impair its virtue. The refinement prevails and, as itwere, succeeds; holds its own in the medley of accidents, where nothingelse is refined unless it be the amplitude of the quiet note in thefront of the Metropolitan Club; amuses itself in short with being asextravagantly intellectual as it likes. Why, therefore, given thesurrounding medium, does it so triumphantly impose itself, and imposeitself not insidiously and gradually, but immediately and with force?Why does it not pay the penalty of expressing an idea and being foundedon one?such scant impunity seeming usually to be enjoyed among us, atthis hour, by any artistic intention of the finer strain? But I putthese questions only to give them upfor what I feel beyond anythingelse is that Mr. Saint-Gaudens somehow takes care of himself.To what measureless extent he does this on occasion one was to learn, indue course, from his magnificent Lincoln at Chicagothe lesson therebeing simply that of a mystery exquisite, the absolute inscrutable; oneof the happiest cases known to our time, known doubtless to any time, ofthe combination of intensity of effect with dissimulation, with deepdisavowal, of process. After seeing the Lincoln one consents, for itsauthor, to the drop of questionsthat is the lame truth; a truth in theabsence of which I should have risked another word or two, haveaddressed perhaps even a brief challenge to a certain ambiguity in theSherman. Its idea, to which I have alluded, strikes me as equivocal, ormore exactly as double; the image being, on the one side, and splendidlyrendered, that of an overwhelming military advance, an irresistiblemarch into an enemys countrythe strain forward, the very inflation ofdrapery with the rush, symbolizing the very breath of the Destroyer. Butthe idea is at the same timewhich part of it is also admirablyexpressedthat the Destroyer is a messenger of peace, with the olivebranch too waved in the blast and with embodied grace, in the form of abeautiful American girl, attending his business. And I confess to alapse of satisfaction in the presence of this interweavingthe resultdoubtless of a sharp suspicion of all attempts, however glittering andgolden, to confound destroyers with benefactors. The military monumentin the City Square responds evidently, wherever a pretext can be foundfor it, to a desire of mens hearts; but I would have it always asmilitary as possible, and I would have the Destroyer, in intention atleast, not docked of one of his bristles. I would have him deadly andterrible, and, if he be wanted beautiful, beautiful only as a war-godand crested not with peace, but with snakes. Peace is a long way roundfrom him, and blood and ashes in between. So, with a less intimateperversity, I think, than that of Mr. Saint-Gaudenss brilliant scheme,I would have had a Sherman of the terrible march (the immortal march,in all abundance, if that be the needed note), not irradiatingbenevolence, but signifying, by every ingenious device, the misery, theruin and the vengeance of his track. It is not ones affair to attemptto teach an artist how such horrors may be monumentally signified; it isenough that their having been perpetrated is the very ground of themonument. And monuments should always have a clean, clear meaning.                                   IVI must positively get into the gate of the Park, howevereven at therisk of appearing to have marched round through Georgia to do so. Ifound myself, in May and June, getting into it whenever I could, and ifI spoke just now of the loud and inexpensive charm (inexpensive in thesthetic sense) of the precinct of approach to it, that must positivelyhave been because the Park diffuses its grace. One grasped at everypretext for finding it inordinately amiable, and nothing was morenoteworthy than that one felt, in doing so, how this was the only way toplay the game in fairness. The perception comes quickly, in New York, ofthe singular and beautiful but almost crushing mission that has beenlaid, as an effect of time, upon this limited territory, which has risento the occasion, from the first, so consistently and bravely. It is acase, distinctly, in which appreciation and gratitude for a publicfunction admirably performed are twice the duty, on the visitors part,that they may be in other such cases. We may even say, putting it simplyand strongly, that if he doesnt here, in his thought, keep patting thePark on the back, he is guilty not alone of a failure of naturaltenderness, but of a real deviation from social morality. For this merenarrow oblong, much _too_ narrow and very much too short, had directlyprescribed to it, from its origin, to do, officially, on behalf of theCity, the publicly amiable, and _all_ the publicly amiableall therecould be any question of in the conditions: incurring thus a heaviercharge, I respectfully submit, than one has ever before seen sogallantly carried. Such places, the municipally-institutedpleasure-grounds of the greater and the smaller cities, abound about theworld and everywhere, no doubt, agreeably enough play their part; but isthe part anywhere else as heroically played in proportion to thedifficulty? The difficulty in New York, _that_ is the point for therestless analyst; conscious as he is that other cities even in spite ofthemselves lighten the strain and beguile the taska burden which hereon the contrary makes every inch of its weight felt. This means a gooddeal, for the space comprised in the original New York scheme representsin truth a wonderful economy and intensity of effort. It would go hardwith us not to satisfy ourselves, in other quarters (and it is of thepolitical and commercial capitals we speak), of some such amount ofgeneral outside amenity, of charm in the town at large, as may hereand there, even at widely-scattered points, relieve the oerfraughtheart. The sense of the picturesque often finds its account in strangeand unlikely matters, but has none the less a way of finding it, and so,in the coming and going, takes the chance. But the New York problem hasalways resided in the absence of any chance to take, however one mightcome and gocome and go, that is, before reaching the Park.To the Park, accordingly, and to the Park only, hitherto, the stheticappetite has had to address itself, and the place has therefore bornethe brunt of many a peremptory call, acting out year after year thecharacter of the cheerful, capable, bustling, even if overworked,hostess of the one inn, somewhere, who has to take all the travel, whois often at her wits end to know how to deal with it, but who, none theless, has, for the honour of the house, never once failed ofhospitality. That is how we see Central Park, utterly overdone by therun on its resources, yet also never having had to make an excuse.When once we have taken in thus its remarkable little history, there isno endearment of appreciation that we are not ready to lay, as atribute, on its breast; with the interesting effect, besides, of ourrecognizing in this light how the place has had to be, in detail andfeature, exactly what it is. It has had to have something for everybody,since everybody arrives famished; it has had to multiply itself toextravagance, to pathetic little efforts of exaggeration and deception,to be, breathlessly, everywhere and everything at once, and produce onthe spot the particular romantic object demanded, lake or river orcataract, wild woodland or teeming garden, boundless vista or boskynook, noble eminence or smiling valley. It has had to have feature atany price, the clamour of its customers being inevitably _for_ feature;which accounts, as we forgivingly see, for the general rather eruptiveand agitated effect, the effect of those old quaint prints which give ina single view the classic, gothic and other architectural wonders of theworld. That is its sole defectits being inevitably too self-conscious,being afraid to be just vague and frank and quiet. I should compare heragainand the propriety is proved by this instinctively femininepronounto an actress in a company destitute, through an epidemic orsome other stress, of all other feminine talent; so that she assumes onsuccessive nights the most dissimilar parts and ranges in the course ofa week from the tragedy queen to the singing chambermaid. That valour byitself wins the public and brings down the houseit being really amarvel that she should in no part fail of a hit. Which is what I mean,in short, by the sweet _ingratiation_ of the Park. You are perfectlyaware, as you hang about her in May and June, that you _have_, as atravelled person, beheld more remarkable scenery and communed withnature in ampler or fairer forms; but it is quite equally definite toyou that none of those adventures have counted more to you forexperience, for stirred sensibilityinasmuch as you can be, at the best,and in the showiest countries, only thrilled by the pastoral or theawful, and as to pass, in New York, from the discipline of the streetsto this so different many-smiling presence is to be thrilled at everyturn.The strange thing, moreover, is that the crowd, in the happiest seasons,at favouring hours, the polyglot Hebraic crowd of pedestrians inparticular, has, for what it is, none but the mildest action on thenerves. The nerves are too grateful, the intention of beauty everywheretoo insistent; it places the superfluous figures with an art of itsown, even when placing them in heavy masses, and they become for youpractically as your fellow-spectators of the theatre, whose proximityyou take for granted, while the little overworked _cabotine_ we havehypothesized, the darling of the public, is vocalizing or capering. Irecall as singularly contributive in all this sense the impression of asplendid Sunday afternoon of early summer, when, during a couple ofhours spent in the mingled medium, the variety of accents with which theair swarmed seemed to make it a question whether the Park itself or itsvisitors were most polyglot. The condensed geographical range, thenumber of kinds of scenery in a given space, competed with the number oflanguages heard, and the whole impression was of ones having had but toturn in from the Plaza to make, in the most agreeable manner possible,the tour of the little globe. And that, frankly, I think, was the bestof all impressionswas seeing New York at its best; for if ever onecould feel at ones ease about the social question, it would besurely, somehow, on such an occasion. The number of persons incirculation was enormousso great that the question of how they had gotthere, from their distances, and would get away again, in the soformidable public conveyances, loomed, in the background, rather like askeleton at the feast; but the general note was thereby, intensely, thepopular, and the brilliancy of the show proportionately striking. Thatis the great and only brilliancy worth speaking of, to my sense, in thegeneral American scenethe air of hard prosperity, the ruthlesslypushed-up and promoted look worn by men, women and children alike. Iremember taking that appearance, of the hour or two, for a climax to thesense that had most remained with me after a considerable previousmoving about over the land, the sense of the small quantity of merehuman sordidness of state to be observed.One is liable to observe it in _any_ best of all possible worlds, and Ihad not, in truth, gone out of my way either to avoid it or to look forit; only I had met it enough, in other climes, without doing so, andhad, to be veracious, not absolutely and utterly missed it in theAmerican. Images of confirmed (though, strangely, of active, occupiedand above all sensitive) squalor had I encountered in New Hampshirehills; also, below the Southern line, certain special, certain awfulexamples, in Black and White alike, of the last crudity of condition.These spots on the picture had, however, lost themselves in the generalattestation of the truth most forced home, the vision of the country as,supremely, a field for the unhampered revel, the unchecked _essor_,material and moral, of the common man and the common woman. Howsplendidly they were making it all answer, for the most part, or to theextent of the so rare public collapse of the individual, had been anobservation confirmed for me by a rapid journey to the Pacific coast andback; yet I had doubtless not before seen it so answer as in this veryconcrete case of the swarming New York afternoon. It was little to say,in that particular light, that such grossnesses as want or tatters orgin, as the unwashed face or the ill-shod, and still less the unshod,foot, or the mendicant hand, became strange, unhappy, far-off thingsitwould even have been an insult to allude to them or to be explicitlycomplacent about their absence. The case was, unmistakably, universally,of the common, the very common man, the very common woman and the verycommon child; but all enjoying what I have called their promotion, theirrise in the social scale, with that absence of acknowledging flutter,that serenity of assurance, which marks, for the impressed class, theschool-boy or the school-girl who is accustomed, and who always quiteexpects, to move up. The children at play, more particularly thelittle girls, formed the characters, as it were, in which the story waswritten largest; frisking about over the greenswards, grouping togetherin the vistas, with an effect of the exquisite in attire, of delicaciesof dress and personal keep-up, as through the shimmer of silk, thegloss of beribboned hair, the gleam of cared-for teeth, the pride ofvarnished shoe, that might well have created a doubt as to theirpopular affiliation. This affiliation was yet established bysufficiencies of context, and might well have been, for that matter, byevery accompanying vocal or linguistic note, the swarm of queer sounds,mostly not to be interpreted, that circled round their pretty heads asif they had been tamers of odd, outlandish, perching little birds. Theyfell moreover into the vast category of those ubiquitous children of thepublic schools who occupy everywhere, in the United States, so much ofthe forefront of the stage, and at the sight of whose so remarkably cladand shod condition the brooding analyst, with the social question never,after all, too much in abeyance, could clap, in private, the mostreactionary hands.The brooding analyst had in fact, from the first of his return,recognized in the mere detail of the testimony everywhere offered to thehigh pitch of the American shoe-industry, a lively incentive to cheerfulviews; the population showing so promptly, in this connection, as thebest equipped in the world. The impression at first had beenirresistible: two industries, at the most, seemed to rule the Americanscene. The dentist and the shoedealer divided it between them; to thatdegree, positively, that in public places, in the perpetual electriccars which seem to ones desperation at times (so condemned is one tolive in them) all there measurably _is_ of the American scene, almostany other typical, any other personal fact might be neglected, forconsideration, in the interest of the presentable foot and thefar-shining dental gold. It was a world in which every one, withoutexception, no matter how low in the social scale, wore the best andthe newest, the neatest and the smartest, boots; to be added to which(always for the brooding analyst) was the fascination, so to speak, ofnoting how much more than any other single thing this may do for apossibly compromised appearance. And if my claim for the interest ofthis exhibition seems excessive, I refer the objector without hesitationto a course of equivalent observation in other countries, taking anequally miscellaneous show for his basis. Nothing was more curious thanto trace, on a great ferry-boat, for instance, the effect of lettingones eyes work up, as in speculation, from the lower to the higherextremities of some seated row of ones fellow passengers. The testimonyof the lower might preponderantly have been, always, to theircomparative conquest of affluence and ease; but this presumption gaveway, at successive points, with the mounting vision, and was apt tobreak down entirely under the evidence of face and head. When I sayhead, I mean more particularly, where the men were, concerned, hat;this feature of the equipment being almost always at pains, and with theoddest, most inveterate perversity, to defeat and discredit whatevermight be best in the others. Such are the problems in which a restlessanalysis may land us.Why should the general feeling for the boot, in the United States, beso mature, so evolved, and the feeling for the hat lag at such adistance behind it? The standard as to that article of dress struck meas, everywhere, of the lowest; governed by no consensus of view, customor instinct, no sense of its vital importance in the manly aspect. Andyet the wearer of any loose improvisation in the way of a head-coverwill testify as frankly, in his degree, to the extreme considerationgiven by the community at large, as I have intimated, to the dentalquestion. The terms in which this evidence is presented are often, amongthe people, strikingly artless, but they are a marked advance on theomnipresent opposite signs, those of a systematic detachment from thechair of anguish, with which any promiscuous European exhibition isapt to bristle. I remember to have heard it remarked by a French friend,of a young woman who had returned to her native land after some years ofdomestic service in America, that she had acquired there, with otheradvantages, _le sourire Californien_, and the Californian smile,indeed, expressed, more or less copiously, in undissimulated cubes ofthe precious metal, plays between lips that render scant other tributeto civilization. The greater interest, in this connection, however, isthat impression of the state and appearance of the teeth viewed amongthe refined as supremely important, which the restored absentee, longsurrounded elsewhere with the strangest cynicisms of indifference onthis article, makes the subject of one of his very first notes. Everyone, in society, has good, handsome, pretty, has above all cherishedand tended, teeth; so that the offered spectacle, frequent in othersocieties, of strange irregularities, protrusions, deficiencies, fangsand tusks and cavities, is quite refreshingly and consolingly absent.The consequences of care and forethought, from an early age, thus writethemselves on the facial page distinctly and happily, and it is not toomuch to say that the total show is, among American aspects, cumulativelycharming. One sees it sometimes balance, for charm, against a greaternumber of less fortunate items, in that totality, than one would quiteknow how to begin estimating.But I have strayed again far from my starting-point and have again, Ifear, succumbed to the danger of embroidering my small originalproposition with too many, and scarce larger, derivatives. I left thePlaza, I left the Park steeped in the rose-colour of such a brightnessof Sunday and of summer as had given me, on a couple of occasions,exactly what I desireda simplified attention, namely, and the power torest for the time in the appearance that the awful aliens wereflourishing there in perfections of costume and contentment. One hadonly to take them in as more completely, conveniently and expensively_endimanchs_ than one had ever, on the whole, seen any other people, inorder to feel that one was calling down upon all the elements involvedthe benediction of the futureand calling it down most of all on onesembraced permission not to worry any more. It was by way of notworrying, accordingly, that I found in another presentment of thegeneral scene, chanced upon at a subsequent hour, all sorts ofinteresting and harmonious suggestions. These adventures of the criticalspirit were such mere mild walks and talks as I almost blush to offer,on this reduced scale, as matter of history; but I draw courage from theremembrance that history is never, in any rich sense, the immediatecrudity of what happens, but the much finer complexity of what we readinto it and think of in connection with it. If a walk across the Park,with a responsive friend, late on the golden afternoon of a warmweek-day, and if a consequent desultory stroll, for speculations sake,through certain northward and eastward streets and avenues, of anidentity a little vague to me now, save as a blur of builded evidence asto proprietary incomesif such an incident ministered, on the spot, to aboundless evocation, it then became history of a splendid order: thoughI perhaps must add that it became so for the two participants alone, andwith an effect after all not easy to communicate. The season was over,the recipients of income had retired for the summer, and the large clearvistas were peopled mainly with that conscious hush and that spectralanimation characteristic of places kept, as with all command of time andspace, for the indifferent, the all but insolent, absentee. It was avast, costly, empty newness, redeemed by the rare quiet and coloured bythe pretty light, and I scare know, I confess, why it should have hadanything murmurous or solicitous to say at all, why its eloquence wasnot over when it had thus defined itself as intensely rich and intenselymodern.If I have spoken, with some emphasis, of what it evoked, I mighteasily be left, it would appear, with that emphasis on my handsdid Inot catch, indeed, for my explanation, the very key to the anomaly.Ransacking my brain for the sources of the impressiveness, I see them,of a sudden, locked up in that word modern; the mystery clears in thelight of the fact that one was perhaps, for that half-hour, moreintimately than ever before in touch with the sense of the term. It wasexactly because I seemed, with the ear of the spirit, to hear the wholequarter bid, as with one penetrating voice, for the boon of the future,for some guarantee, or even mere hinted promise, of history andopportunity, that the attitude affected me as the last revelation ofmodernity. What made the revelation was the collective sharpness, so tospeak, of this vocal note, offering any price, offering everything,wanting only to outbid and prevail, at the great auction of life. Seehow ready we areone caught the tone: ready to buy, to pay, topromise; ready to place, to honour, our purchase. We have everything,dont you see? every capacity and appetite, every advantage of educationand every susceptibility of sense; no tip in the world, none that ourtime is capable of giving, has been lost on us: so that all we nowdesire is what you, Mr. Auctioneer, have to dispose of, the greatgoing chance of a time to come. That was the sound unprecedentedlyevoked for me, and in a form that made sound somehow overflow intosight. It was as if, in their high gallery, the bidders, New Yorkersevery one, were before ones eyes; pressing to the front, hanging overthe balustrade, holding out clamorous importunate hands. It was not,certainly, for general style, pride and colour, a Paul Veronese company;even the women, in spite of pearls and brocade and golden hair, failedof that type, and still more inevitably the men, without doublet,mantle, ruff or sword; the nearest approach might have been in the greathounds and the little blackamoors. But my vision had a kind of analogy;for what were the Venetians, after all, but the children of a Republicand of trade? It was, however, mainly, no doubt, an affair of thesupporting marble terrace, the platform of my crowd, with as manycolumns of onyx and curtains of velvet as any great picture could need.About these there would be no difficulty whatever; though this luxury ofvision of the matter had meanwhile no excuse but the fact that the hourwas charming, the waning light still lucid, the air admirable, theneighbourhood a great empty stage, expensively, extravagantly set, andthe detail in frontage and cornice and architrave, in every feature ofevery edifice, as sharp as the uttered words of the plea I have justimagined.                                   VThe American air, I take advantage of this connection to remember, lendsa felicity to all the exactitudes of architecture and sculpture, favourssharp effects, disengages differences, preserves lights, definesprojected shadows. Sculpture, in it, never either loses a value orconceals a loss, and it is everywhere full of help to discriminatedmasses. This remark was to be emphatically made, I found myselfobserving, in presence of so distinct an appeal to high clearness as thegreat Palladian pile just erected by Messrs. Tiffany on one of the uppercorners of Fifth Avenue, where it presents itself to the friendly skywith a great nobleness of white marble. One is so thankful to it, Irecognize, for not having twenty-five stories, which it might easilyhave had, I suppose, in the wantonness of wealth or of greed, that onegives it a double greeting, rejoicing to excess perhaps at its merelyremaining, with the three fine arched and columned stages above its highbasement, within the conditions of sociable symmetry. One may breakones heart, certainly, over its only being, for interest, a greatmiscellaneous shopif one has any heart left in New York for suchadventures. One may also reflect, if any similar spring of reflectionwill still serve, on its being, to the very great limitation of itsdignity, but a more or less pious _pastiche_ or reproduction, the copyof a model that sits where Venetian water-steps keepor used tokeep!vulgar invasion at bay. But I hasten to add that one will do thesethings only at the cost of not putting in wherever one can the patchof optimism, the sigh of relief, the glow of satisfaction, or whateverelse the pardonably factitious emotion may be calledwhich in New Yorkis very bad economy. Look for interest where you may, cultivate aworking felicity, press the spring hard, and you will see that, towhatever air Palladian piles may have been native, they can nowhere telltheir great cold calculated story, in measured chapter and verse, betterthan to the strong sea-light of New York. This medium has the abundanceof some ample childless mother who consoles herself for her sterility byan unbridled course of adoptionas I seemed again to make out inpresence of the tiers of white marble that are now on their way toreplace the granitic mass of the old Reservoir, _ultima Thule_ of thenorthward walk of ones early time.The reservoir of learning here taking form above great terraceswhich myminds eye makes as great as it would likelifts, once more, from theheart the weight of the tall building it apparently doesnt propose tobecome. I could admire, in the unfinished state of the work, but thelower courses of this inestimable structure, the Public Library that isto gather into rich alliance and splendid ease the great minor Librariesof the town; it was enough for my delight, however, that the conditionsengage for a covering of the earth rather than an invasion of the airofso supreme an effect, at the pitch things have reached, is this singleelement of a generous area. It offers the best of reasons for speakingof the project as inestimable. Any building that, being beautiful,presents itself as seated rather than as standing, can do with yourimagination what it will; you ask it no question, you give it a freefield, content only if it will sit and sit and sit. And if youinterrogate your joy, in the connection, you will find it largelyfounded, I think, on all the implications thus conveyed of aproportionately smaller quantity of the great religion of the Elevator.The lateral development of great buildings is as yet, in the UnitedStates, but an opportunity for the legs, is in fact almost their soleopportunitya circumstance that, taken alone, should eloquently plead;but it has another blest value, for the imagination, for the nerves, asa check on the constant obsession of ones living, of every onesliving, by the packed and hoisted basket. The sempiternal lift, forones comings and goings, affects one at last as an almost intolerablesymbol of the herded and driven state and of that malady of preferencefor gregarious ways, of insistence on gregarious ways only, by which thepeople about one seem ridden. To wait, perpetually, in a human bunch, inorder to be hustled, under military drill, the imperative order to steplively, into some tight mechanic receptacle, fearfully and wonderfullyworking, is conceivable, no doubt, as a sad liability of our nature, butrepresents surely, when cherished and sacrificed to, a strangeperversion of sympathies and ideals. Anything that breaks the gregariousspell, that relieves one of ones share, however insignificant, of theabject collective consciousness of being pushed and pressed in, withsomething that ones shoulders and ones heels must dodge at theirperil, something that slides or slams or bangs, operating, in your rear,as ruthlessly as the guillotineanything that performs this office putsa price on the lonely sweetness of a step or two taken by ones self, ofdeviating into some sense of independent motive power, of climbing evensome grass-grown staircase, with a dream perhaps of the thrill offellow-feeling _then_ taking, then finding, placesomething likeRobinson Crusoes famous thrill before Fridays footprint in the sand.However these things might be, I recall further, as an incident of thathour of evocation, the goodly glow, under this same illumination, ofan immense red building, off in the clear north-east quarter, which hadhung back, with all success, from the perpendicular form, and whichactually covered ground with its extensions of base, its wideterrestrial wings. It had, I remember, in the early evening light, ahomely kindness of diffused red brick, and to make out then that it wasa great exemplary Hospital, one of the many marvels of New York in thisgeneral order, was to admire the exquisite art with which, in such amedium, it had so managed to invest itself with stillness. It was asquiet there, on its ample interspace, as if the clamorous city,roundabout, as if the passion of the Elevated and of the Elevator inespecial, were forever at rest and no one were stepping lively for milesand miles away; so that visibly, it had a spell to cast and a characterto declarethings I was won over, on the spot, to desire a nearer viewof. Fortune presently favoured this purpose, and almost my lastimpression of New York was gathered, on a very hot June morning, in thelong, cool corridors of the Presbyterian Hospital, and in those hallsof pain, the high, quiet, active wards, silvery-dim with theirwhiteness and their shade, where the genius of the terrible city seemedto filter in with its energy sifted and softened, with its hugegood-nature refined. There were reasons beyond the scope of theseremarks for the interest of that hour, but it is at least within thescope that I recall noting there, all responsively, as not before, thatif the _direct_ pressure of New York is too often to ends that strike usas vulgar, the indirect is capable, and perhaps to an unlimited degree,of these lurking effects of delicacy. The immediate expression is theexpression of violence, but you may find there is something left,something kept back for you, if that has not from the first fatallydeafened you. It carries with it an after-sense which put on for me,under several happy intimations, the image of some garden of the finestflowersor of such as might be on the way to become the finestmasked byan enormous bristling hedge of defensive and aggressive vegetation,lacerating, defiant, not to be touched without blood. One saw the gardenitself, behind its hedge and approachable only by those in thesecretone divined it to contain treasures of delicacy, many of themperhaps still to be developed, but attesting the possibilities of thesoil. My Presbyterian Hospital was somehow in the garden, just where thesoil, the very human soil itself, was richest, andthough this mayappear an odd tribute to an institution founded on the principle ofinstant decision and actionit affected me, amid its summer airs and itsboundless, soundless business, as surpassingly delicate. _There_, ifnowhere else, was adjustment of tone; there was the note of mildness andthe sense of manners; under the impression of which I am not sure of nothaving made up my mind that, were I merely alone and disconcerted,merely unprepared and unwarned, in the vast, dreadful place, as musthappen to so many a helpless mortal, I should positively desire orelect, as they say, to become the victim of some such mischance aswould put me into relation again, the ambulance or the police aiding,with these precious saving presences. They might re-establish for me,before the final extinction or dismissal, some belief in manners and intone.Was it in the garden also, as I say, that the Metropolitan Museum hadmeanwhile struck me as standing?the impression of a quite other hazardof _flnerie_ this, and one of those memories, once more, that I findmyself standing off from, as under the shadow of their too numeroussuggestion. That institution _is_, decidedly, to-day, part of the innerNew York harmony that I have described as a touched after-sense; so thatif there were, scattered about the place, elements prompting rich, ifvague, evocations, this was recognizably one of the spots over whichsuch elements would have most freedom to play. The original Museum was athing of the far past; hadnt I the vision of it, from ancient days,installed, stately though scrappy, in a large eccentric house in WestFourteenth Street, a house the prior period, even the early, impressiveconstruction of which one recalled from days still more ancient, days sofar away that to be able to travel back to them was almost as good, oras bad, as being a centenarian? This superfluous consciousness of theoriginal seat of the Museum, of where and what it had been, was one ofthose terrible traps to memory, about the town, which baited themselveswith the cheese of association, so to speak, in order to exhibit oneafterwards as caught, or, otherwise expressed, as old; such being theconvicted state of the unfortunate who knows the _whole_ of so many ofhis stories. The case is never really disguisable; we get off perhapswhen we only know the ends of things, but beyond that our historic sensebetrays us. We have known the beginnings, we have been present, in thevarious connections, at the birth, the life and the death, and it iswonderful how traceably, in such a place as New York, careers ofimportance may run their course and great institutions, while you arejust watching, rise, prosper and fall. I had had my shudder, in thatsame Fourteenth Street, for the complete disappearance of a largechurch, as massive as brown stone could make it, at the engagingconstruction of which ones tender years had assisted (it exactlyfaced the parental home, and nefarious, perilous play was found possiblein the works), but which, after passing from youth to middle age andfrom middle age to antiquity, has vanished as utterly as the AssyrianEmpire.So, it was to be noted, had the parental home, and so the first home ofthe Museum, by what I made out, beyond Sixth Avenueafter which, for thelast-named, had there not been a second seat, long since superseded too,a more prolonged _tape_ on the glorious road? This also gave out ashimmer from the middle time, but with the present favouring stage ofthe journey the glorious road seems to stretch away. It is a palace ofart, truly, that sits there on the edge of the Park, rearing itself witha radiance, yet offering you expanses to tread; but I found it invite meto a matter of much more interest than any mere judging of itsdispositions. It spoke with a hundred voices of that huge process ofhistoric waste that the place in general keeps putting before you; butshowing it in a light that drew out the harshness or the sadness, thepang, whatever it had seemed elsewhere, of the reiterated sacrifice topecuniary profit. For the question here was to be of the advantage tothe spirit, not to the pocket; to be of the sthetic advantage involvedin the wonderful clearance to come. From the moment the visitor takes intwo or three thingsfirst, perhaps, the scale on which, in the past,bewildering tribute has flowed in; second, the scale on which it mustabsolutely now flow out; and, third, the presumption created by thevivacity of these two movements for a really fertilizing stir of thegroundhe sees the whole place as the field of a drama the nearer viewof the future course of which he shall be sorry to lose. One neverwinces after the first little shock, when Education is expensiveonewinces only at the expense which, like so much of the expense of NewYork, doesnt educate; and Education, clearly, was going to seat herselfin these marble hallsadmirably prepared for her, to all appearanceandissue her instructions without regard to cost. The obvious, thebeautiful, the thrilling thing was that, without regard to cost either,they were going to be obeyed: that inference was somehow irresistible,the disembodied voices I have spoken of quite forcing it home and thepalace roof arching to protect it as the dome of the theatre protectsthe performance. I know not if all past purchase, in these annals(putting the Cesnola Collection aside), has been without reproach, butit struck me as safe to gather that (putting aside again Mr. Marquandsrare munificence) almost no past acceptance of gifts and bequests inkind had been without weakness. In the light of Sargents splendidportrait, simply, there would have been little enough weakness toassociate with Mr. Marquands collection; but the gifts and bequests ingeneral, even when speciously pleasing or interesting, constitute anobject-lesson in the large presence of which the New York mind willperform its evolutionan evolution traceable, and with sharpness, inadvance. I shall nevertheless not attempt to foretell it; for sufficientto the situation, surely, is the appearance, represented by itsannouncing shadow, that Acquisitionacquisition if need be on thehighest termsmay, during the years to come, bask here as in a climateit has never before enjoyed. There was money in the air, ever so muchmoneythat was, grossly expressed, the sense of the whole intimation.And the money was to be all for the most exquisite thingsfor _all_ themost exquisite except creation, which was to be off the scenealtogether; for art, selection, criticism, for knowledge, piety, taste.The intimationwhich was somehow, after all, so pointedwould have beendetestable if interests other, and smaller, than these had been inquestion. The Education, however, was to be exclusively that of thesense of beauty; this defined, romantically, for my evoked drama, thecentral situation. What left me wondering a little, all the same, wasthe contradiction involved in ones not thinking of some of itsprospective passages as harsh. Here it is, no doubt, that one catchesthe charm of rigours that take place all in the sthetic and thecritical world. They would be invidious, would be cruel, if applied topersonal interests, but they take on a high benignity as soon as thevalues concerned become values mainly for the mind. (If they happen tohave also a trade-value this is pure superfluity and excess.) Thethought of the acres of canvas and the tons of marble to be turned outinto the cold world as the penalty of old error and the warrant for aclean slate ought to have drawn tears from the eyes. But these impendingincidents affected me, in fact, on the spot, as quite radiantdemonstrations. The Museum, in short, was going to be great, and in thegeniality of the life to come such sacrifices, though resembling thoseof the funeral-pile of Sardanapalus, dwindled to nothing.                                   V                       THE BOWERY AND THEREABOUTS                                   II scarce know, once more, if such a matter be a sign of the city itself,or only another perversity on the part of a visitor apt to press alittle too hard, everywhere, on the spring of the show; but wherever Iturned, I confess, wherever any aspect seemed to put forth a freshness,there I found myself saying that this aspect was ones strongestimpression. It is impossible, as I now recollect, not to be amused atthe great immediate differences of scene and occasion that could producesuch a judgment, and this remark directly applies, no doubt, to theaccident of a visit, one afternoon of the dire mid-winter, to a theatrein the Bowery at which a young actor in whom I was interested had foundfor the moment a fine melodramatic opportunity. This small adventureifthe adventures of rash observation be ever smallwas to remain embalmedfor me in all its odd, sharp notes, and perhaps in none more than in itselement of contrast with an image antediluvian, the memory of theconditions of a Bowery theatre, _the_ Bowery Theatre in fact,contemporary with my more or less gaping youth. Was that vast dingyedifice, with its illustrious past, still standing?a point on which Iwas to remain vague while I electrically travelled through a strange, asinister over-roofed clangorous darkness, a wide thoroughfare beset, forall its width, with sound and fury, and bristling, amid the traffic,with posts and piles that were as the supporting columns of a vast cold,yet also uncannily-animated, sepulchre. It was like moving the length ofan interminable cage, beyond the remoter of whose bars lighted shops,struggling dimly under other pent-house effects, offered their Hebrewfaces and Hebrew names to a human movement that affected one even thenas a breaking of waves that had rolled, for their welter on this verystrand, from the other side of the globe. I was on my way to enjoy, nodoubt, some peculiarly American form of the theatric mystery, but myway led me, apparently, through depths of the Orient, and I shouldclearly take my place with an Oriental public.I took it in fact in such a curtained corner of a private box as mighthave appeared to commit me to the most intimate interest possiblemighthave done so, that is, if all old signs had not seemed visibly to failand new questions, mockingly insoluble, to rise. The old signs wouldhave been those of some historic community, so to speak, between theplay and the public, between those opposed reciprocal quantities: such aconsciousness of the same general terms of intercourse for instance, asI seemed to have seen prevail, long years ago, under the great dim,bleak, sonorous dome of the old Bowery. Nothing so much imposed itselfat first as this suggestive contrastthe vision of the other big bareranting stupid stage, the grey void, smelling of dust and tobacco-juice,of a scene on which realism was yet to dawn, but which addressed itself,on the other hand, to an audience at one with it. Audience andproduction had been then of the same stripe and the same tradition;the pitch, that is, had been of our own domestic and romantic tradition(to apply large words to a loose matter, a matter rich in our very ownsthetic idiosyncrasy). I should say, in short, if it didnt savour ofpedantry, that if this ancient poetic had been purely a home-grownthing, nursed in the English intellectual cradle, and in the American ofa time when the American resembled the English closely enough, so theinstincts from which it sprang were instincts familiar to the whole bodyof spectators, whose dim sense of art (to use again the big word) wasonly not thoroughly English because it must have been always soabundantly Irish. The foreign note, in that thinner air, was, at themost, the Irish, and I think of the elements of the Jack Sheppard andClaude Duval Bowery, including the peanuts and the orange-peel, asquite harmoniously Irish. From the corner of the box of my so improvedplayhouse further down, the very name of which moreover had thecosmopolite lack of point, I made out, in the audience, the usual meremonotony of the richer exoticism. No single face, beginning with thoseclose beside me (for my box was a shared luxury), but referred itself,by my interpretation, to some such strange outland form as we had notdreamed of in my day. There they all sat, the representatives of theraces we have nothing in common with, as naturally, as comfortably, asmunchingly, as if the theatre were their constant practiceand, asregards the munching, I may add, I was struck with the appearance ofquality and cost in the various confections pressed from moment tomoment upon our notice by the little playhouse peddlers.It comes over me under this branch of my reminiscence, that these almosthigh-class luxuries, circulating in such a company, were a sort ofsupreme symbol of the _promoted_ state of the aspirant to Americanconditions. He, or more particularly she, had been promoted, and, moreor less at a bound, to the habitual use of chocolate-creams, and indeedof other dainties, refined and ingenious, compared with which these arequite _vieux jeu_. This last remark might in fact open up for us, had Ispace, a view, interesting to hold a moment, or to follow as far as itmight take us, of the wondrous consumption by the people, over theland, of the most elaborate solid and liquid sweets, such products asform in other countries an expensive and select dietary. The wholephenomenon of this omnipresent and essentially popular appeal of theconfectioner and pastry-cook, I can take time but to note, is moresignificant of the economic, and even of the social situation of themasses than many a circumstance honoured with more attention. I foundmyself again and againin presence, for example, of the great glitteringtemples, the bristling pagodas, erected to the worship in questionwherever men and women, perhaps particularly women, most congregate, andabove all under the high domes of the great modern railway stationsIfound myself wondering, I say, what such facts represented, what lightthey might throw upon manners and wages. Wages, in the country at large,are largely mannersthe only manners, I think it fair to say, one mostlyencounters; the market and the home therefore look alike dazzling, atfirst, in this reflected, many-coloured lustre. It speaks somehow,beyond anything else, of the diffused sense of material easesince thesolicitation of sugar couldnt be so hugely and artfully organized ifthe response were not clearly proportionate. But how is the responseitself organized, and what are the other items of that general budget oflabour, what in especial are the attenuations of that general state offatigue, in which so much purchasing-power can flow to the supposedlysuperfluous? The wage-earners, the toilers of old, notably in otherclimes, were known by the wealth of their songs; and has it, on theselines, been given to the American people to be known by the number oftheir candies?I must not let the question, however, carry me too farquite away fromthe point I was about to make of my sense of the queer chasm over which,on the Saturday afternoon at the Windsor Theatre, I seemed to see the sodomestic drama reach out to the so exotic audience and the so exoticaudience reach out to the so domestic drama. The play (a masterpiece ofits type, if I may so far strain a point, in such a case, and in theinterest of my young friends excellent performance, as to predicatetype) was American, to intensity, in its blank conformity toconvention, the particular implanted convention of the place. Thisconvention, simply expressed, was that there should never be anythingdifferent in a play (the most conservative of human institutions) fromwhat there had always been before; that _that place_, in a word, shouldalways know the very same theatric thing, any deviation from which mightbe phrenology, or freemasonry, or ironmongery, or anything else in theworld, but would never be drama, especially drama addressed to the heartof the people. The tricks and the traps, the _trucs_, the wholestage-carpentry, might freely renew themselves, to create for artlessminds the illusion of a difference; but the sense of the business wouldstill have to reside in our ineradicable Anglo-Saxon policy, or ourseemingly deep-seated necessity, of keeping, where representation isconcerned, so far away from the truth and the facts of life as really tobetray a fear in us of possibly doing something like them should we becaught nearer. Foreigners, in general, unmistakably, in any attempt torender life, obey the instinct of keeping closer, positively recognizethe presence and the solicitation of the deep waters; yet here was myhouseful of foreigners, physiognomically branded as such, confrontedwith our pale poeticfairly caught for schooling in our art of makingthe best of it. Nothing (in the texture of the occasion) could have hada sharper interest than this demonstration that, since what we mostpretend to do with them is thoroughly to school them, the schooling, byour system, cannot begin too soon nor pervade their experience too much.Were they going to rise to it, or rather to fall to itto _our_instinct, as distinguished from their own, for picturing life? Were theyto take our lesson, submissively, in order to get with it our smartertraps and tricks, our superior Yankee machinery (illustrated in the casebefore them, for instance, by a wonderful folding bed in which thevillain of the piece, pursuing the virtuous heroine round and round theroom and trying to leap over it after her, is, at the young ladys touchof a hidden spring, engulfed as in the jaws of a crocodile?) Or would itbe their dim intellectual resistance, a vague stir in them of someunwitting heritageof the finer irony, that I should make out, on thecontrary, as withstanding the effort to corrupt them, and thus perhapsreally promising to react, over the head of our offered mechanic bribes,on our ingrained intellectual platitude?One had only to formulate that question to seem to see the issue hangthere, for the excitement of the matter, quite as if the determinationwere to be taken on the spot. For the opposition over the chasm of thefootlights, as I have called it, grew intense truly, as I took in on oneside the hue of the Galician cheek, the light of the Moldavian eye, thewhole pervasive facial mystery, swaying, at the best, for the moment,over the gulf, on the vertiginous bridge of American confectioneryandtook in on the other the perfect Yankee quality of the challenge whichstared back at them as in the white light of its hereditary thinness. Ineednt say that when I departedperhaps from excess of suspenseit waswithout seeing the balance drop to either quarter, and I am afraid Ithink of the odd scene as still enacted in many places and many ways,the inevitable rough union in discord of the two groups of instincts,the fusion of the two camps by a queer, clumsy, wasteful socialchemistry. Such at all events are the roundabout processes of peacefulhistory, the very history that succeeds, for our edification, in _not_consisting of battles and blood and tears.                                   III was happily to find, at all events, that I had not, on that occasion,done with the Bowery, or with its neighbourhoodas how could one notrejoice to return to an air in which such infinite suggestion mightflower? The season had advanced, though the summer night was no morethan genial, and the question, for this second visit, was of a lookin, with two or three friends, at three or four of the mostcharacteristic evening resorts (for reflection and conversation) ofthe dwellers on the East side. It was definitely not, the question, ofany gaping view of the policed underworldunanimously pronounced animposture, in general, at the best, and essentially less interestingthan the exhibition of public manners. I found on the spot, in harmonywith this preference, that nothing better could have been desired, inthe way of pure presentable picture, subject always to the swinginglantern-light of the individual imagination, than the first (as I thinkit was, for the roaming hour) of our penetrated hauntsa largesemi-subterranean establishment, a beer-cellar rich in the sportingnote, adorned with images of strong men and lovely women, prize-fightersand _ballerine_, and finding space in its deep bosom for a billiard-roomand a bowling-alley, all sociably squeezed together; finding space,above all, for a collection of extraordinarily equivocal types ofconsumers: an intensity of equivocation indeed planted, just as if toawait direct and convenient study, in the most typical face of thecollection, a face which happened, by good fortune, to be that of themost officious presence. When the element of the equivocal in personalcharacter and history takes on, in New York, an addition from all therest of the swarming ambiguity and fugacity of race and tongue, theresult becomes, for the picture-seeker, indescribably, luridly strong.There always comes up, at view of the low physiognomy shown inconditions that denote a measure of impunity and ease, the questionthanwhich few, I think, are more interesting to the psychologistof theforms of ability _consistent_ with lowness; the question of the qualityof intellect, the subtlety of character, the mastery of the art of life,with which the extremity of baseness may yet be associated. Thatquestion held me, I confess, so under its spell during those almostfirst steps of our ingenuous _enqute_, that I would gladly haveprolonged, just there, my opportunity to sound it.The fascination was of course in the perfection of the baseness, and thepuzzle in the fact that it could be subject, without fatally muddling,without tearing and rending them, to those arts of life, thosequantities of conformity, the numerous involved accommodations andpatiences, that are _not_ in the repertory of the wolf and the snake.Extraordinary, we say to ourselves on such occasions, the amount offormal tribute that civilization is after all able to gouge out ofapparently hopeless stuff; extraordinary that it can make a presentablesheath for such fangs and such claws. The mystery is in the _how_ of theprocess, in the wonderful little wavering borderland between nature andart, the place of the crooked seam where, if psychology had the adequatelens, the white stitches would show. All this played through onesthought, to the infinite extension of the sufficiently close andthoroughly _banal_ beer-cellar. There happened to be reasons, not to beshaded over, why one of my companions should cause a particular chord ofrecognition to vibrate, and the very convergence of hushed looks, in theso loud general medium, seemed to lay bare, from table to table, thesecret of the common countenance (common to that place) put off itsguard by curiosity, almost by amiability. The secret was doubtless inmany cases but the poor familiar human secret of the vulgar mind, of thesoul unfurnished, so to speak, in respect to delicacy, probity, pity,with a social decoration of the mere bleak walls of instinct; but it wasthe unforgettable little personality that I have referred to as thepresiding spirit, it was the spokesman of our welcome, the master of thescene himself, who struck me as presenting my question in its finestterms. To conduct a successful establishment, to _be_ a spokesman, anadministrator, an employer of labour and converser on subjects, letalone a citizen and a tax-payer, was to have an existence abounding inrelations and to be subject to the law that a relation, howeverimperfectly human or social, is at the worst a matter that can only bedescribed as delicate. Well, in presence of the abysmal obliquity ofsuch a face, of the abysmal absence of traceability or coherency in suchantecedents, where did the different delicacies involved come in atall?how did intercourse emerge at all, and, much more, emerge sobrilliantly, as it were, from its dangers? The answer had to be, for themoment, no doubt, that if there be such a state as that ofmisrepresenting your value and use, there is also the rarer condition ofbeing so sunk beneath the level of appearance as not to be able torepresent them at all. Appearance, in you, has thus not only no notes,no language, no authority, but is literally condemned to operate _as_the treacherous sum of your poverties.The jump was straight, after this, to a medium so different that I seemto see, as the one drawback to evoking it again, however briefly, thecircumstance that it started the speculative hare for even a longer andstraighter run. This irrepressible animal covered here, however, a muchgoodlier country, covered it in the interest of a happygeneralizationthe bold truth that even when apparently done to death bythat property of the American air which reduces so many aspects to acommon denominator, certain finer shades of saliency and consistency dooften, by means known to themselves, recover their rights. They are likeswimmers who have had to plunge, to come round and under water, but whopop out a panting head and shine for a moment in the sun. My image isperhaps extravagant, for the question is only of the kept recollectionof a caf pure and simple, particularly pure and particularly simple infact, inasmuch as it dispensed none but soft drinks and presenteditself thus in the light, the quiet, tempered, intensely individuallight, of a beerhouse innocent of beer. I have indeed no other excusefor calling it a beerhouse than the fact that it offered to every sensesuch a deep Germanic peace as abides, for the most part (though notalways even then), where the deep-lidded tankard balances with thescarce shallower bowl of the meditative pipe. This modest asylum had itstone, which I found myself, after a few minutes, ready to take forexquisite, if on no other ground than its almost touching suggestion ofdiscriminations made and preserved in the face of no small difficulty.That is what I meant just now by my tribute to the occasional patienceof unquenched individualismthe practical subtlety of the spiritunashamed of its preference for the minor key, clinging, through thickand thin, to its conception of decency and dignity, and finding means tomake it good even to the exact true shade. These are the real triumphsof artthe discriminations in favour of taste produced not by the gildedand guarded private room, but by making publicity itself delicate,making your barrier against vulgarity consist but in a few tables andchairs, a few coffee-cups and boxes of dominoes. Money in quantitiesenough can always create tone, but it had been created here by mereunbuyable instinct. The charm of the place in short was that its note ofthe exclusive had been arrived at with such a beautifully fine economy.I try, in memory, and for the value of the lesson, to analyze, as itwere, the elements, and seem to recall as the most obvious thecontemplative stillness in which the faint click of the moved dominocould be heard, and into which the placid attention of the quiet, honestmen who were thus testifying for the exquisite could be read. Theexquisite, yes, _was_ the triumph of their tiny temple, with all theloud surrounding triumphs, those of the coarse and the common, making itbut stick the faster, like a well-inserted wedge. And fully to catchthis was to catch by the same stroke the main ground of the effect, tosee that it came most of all from felicity of suppression and omission.There was so visibly too much everywhere else of everything vulgar, thatthere reigned here, for the difference, the learnt lesson that therecould scarce be in such an air of infection little enough, in quantityand mass, of anything. The felicity had its climax in the type, orrather in the individual character, of our host, who, officiating alone,had apparently suppressed all aids to service and succeeded, as by aninspiration of genius, in omitting, for all his years, to learn thecurrent American. He spoke but a dozen words of it, and that wasdoubtless how he best kept the key of the old Germanic peaceof thefriendly stillness in which, while the East side roared, a newmetaphysic might have been thought out or the scheme of a new warintellectualized.                                  IIIAfter this there were other places, mostly higher in the scale, and buta couple of which my memory recovers. There was also, as I recall, asnatched interludean associated dash into a small crammed convivialtheatre, an oblong hall, bristling with pipe and glass, at the end ofwhich glowed for a moment, a little dingily, some broad passage of aYiddish comedy of manners. It hovered there, briefly, as if seen througha spy-glass reaching, across the world, to some far-off dowdy Jewry;then our sense of it became too mixed a matterit was a scent,literally, not further to be followed. There remained with me none theless the patch of alien comedy, with all it implied of esoteric visionon the part of the public. Something of that admonition had indeed,earlier in the season, been sharpso much had one heard of a brilliantYiddish actress who was drawing the town to the East side by the promiseof a new note. This lady, however, had disconcerted my own purpose bysuddenly appearing, in the orthodox quarter, in a language onlydefinable as not in _intention_ Yiddishnot otherwise definable; and Ialso missed, through a like alarm, the opportunity of hearing an admiredactor of the same school. He was Yiddish on the East side, but hecropped up, with a wild growth, in Broadway as well, and his auditorsseemed to know as little as care to what idiom they supposed themselvesto be listening. Marked in New York, by many indications, this vaguenessof ear as to differences, as to identities, of idiom.I must not, however, under that interference, lose the echo of a coupleof other of the impressions of my crowded summer nightand all the lessthat they kept working it, as I seem to remember, up to a higher andhigher pitch. It had been intimated to me that one of these scenes ofour climax had entered the sophisticated phase, that of sacrificing to aself-consciousness that was to be regrettedthat of making eyes, so tospeak, at the larger, the up-town public; that pestilent favour ofsociety which is fatal to everything it touches and which so quicklyleaves the places of its passage unfit for its own use and uninterestingfor any other. This establishment had learned to lay on local colourwith malice prepensethe local colour of its Slav originand was thehaunt, on certain evenings of the week, of yearning groups from FifthAvenue sated with familiar horizons. Yet there were no yearninggroupsnone, that is, save our ownat the time of our visit; there wasonly, very amply and pleasantly presented, another aspect of theperpetual process of the New York intermarriage. As the VenetianRepublic, in the person of the Doge, used to go forth, on occasion, toespouse the Adriatic, so it is quite as if the American, incarnate inits greatest port, were for ever throwing the nuptial ring to the stillmore richly-dowered Atlantic. I speak again less of the nuptial ritesthemselves than of those immediate fruits that struck me everywhere asso characteristicso equally characteristic, I mean, of each party tothe union. The flourishing establishment of my present reference offereddistinctly its outland picture, but showed it in an American frame, andthe features of frame and picture arranged themselves shrewdly together.Quiet couples, elderly bourgeois husbands and wives, sat there overbelated sausage and cheese, potato-salad and Hungarian wine, the wifewith her knitting produced while the husband finished his cigar; and theindication, for the moment, might have been of some evening note ofDantzig or of Buda-Pesth. But the conditioning foreign, and thevisibility of their quite so happily conjugal give-and-take, in NewYork, is my reason for this image of the repeated espousals. Why werethe quiet easy couples, with their homely caf habit (kept in the bestrelation to the growth, under the clicking needles, of the maritalstocking), such remote and indirect results of our local anecdotic past,our famous escape, at our psychological moment, from King George and hisworks, with all sorts of inevitable lapses and hitches in any gratefulconsciousness they might ever have of that prime cause of their newbirth? Yet why, on the other hand, could they affect one, even with theFatherland planked under them in the manner of the praying-carpet spreadbeneath the good Mahometan, as still more disconnected from the historicconsciousness implied in their own type, and with the mere moralidentity of German or Slav, or whatever it might be, too extinct in themfor any possibility of renewal? The exotic boss here did speak, Iremember, fluent East-side New Yorkese, and it was in this wonderfultongue that he expressed to us his superior policy, his refinedphilosophy, announced his plans for the future and presented himself, tomy vision, as a possibly far-reaching master-spirit. What remains withme is this expression, and the colour and the quality of it, and thefree familiarity and the damned foreign impudence, with so much takenfor granted, and all the hitches and lapses, all the solutions ofcontinuity, in _his_ inward assimilation of our heritage and point ofview, matched as these were, on our own side, by such signs of large andcomparatively witless concession. What, oh, what again, were he and hisgoing to make of us?Well, there was the impression, and that was a question on which, for acertain intensity in it, our adventure might have closed; but it was sofar from closing that, late though the hour, it presently opened outinto a vast and complicated picture which I find myself thinking of,after an interval, as the splendid crown of the evening. Here were westill on the East side, but we had moved up, by stages artfullyinspired, into the higher walks, into a pavilion of light and sound andsavoury science that struck one as vaguely vast, as possibly gardenedabout, and that, blazing into the stillness of the small hours, dazzledone with the show of its copious and various activity. The whole visionwas less intimate than elsewhere, but it was a world of custom quiteaway from any mere Delmonico tradition of ones earlier time, and rich,as one might reckon it, in its own queer marks, marks probably never yetreducedinspiring thought!to literary notation; with which it wouldseem better to form a point of departure for fresh exploration thanserve as tail-piece to the end of a chapter. Who were all the people,and whence and whither and why, in the good New York small hours? Where_was_ the place after all, and what might it, or might it not, truly,represent to slightly-fatigued feasters who, in a recess like aprivileged opera-box at a _bal masqu_, and still communing withpolyglot waiters, looked down from their gallery at a multitudinoussupper, a booming orchestra, an elegance of disposed plants and flowers,a perfect organization and an abyss of mystery? Was it on ThirdAvenue, on Second, on fabulous unattempted First? Nothing would induceme to cut down the romance of it, in remembrance, to a mere address,least of all to an awful New York one; New York addresses falling sobelow the grace of a city where the very restaurants may on occasion,under restless analysis, flash back the likeness of Venetian palacesflaring with the old carnival. The ambiguity is the element in which thewhole thing swims for meso nocturnal, so bacchanal, so hugely hattedand feathered and flounced, yet apparently so innocent, almost sopatriarchal again, and matching, in its mixture, with nothing one hadelsewhere known. It breathed its simple New York! New York! at everyimpulse of inquiry; so that I can only echo contentedly, with analysisfor once quite agreeably baffled, Remarkable, unspeakable New York!                                   VI                          THE SENSE OF NEWPORT                                   INewport, on my finding myself back there, threatened me sharply, quiteat first, with that predicament at which I have glanced in anotherconnection or twothe felt condition of having known it too well andloved it too much for description or definition. What was one to sayabout it except that one _had_ been so affected, so distraught, and thatdiscriminations and reasons were buried under the dust of use? There wasa chance indeed that the breath of the long years (of the interval ofabsence, I mean) would have blown away this dustand that, precisely,was what one was eager to see. To go out, to look about, to recover thesense, was accordingly to put the question, without delay, to theproofand with the happy consequence, I think, of an escape from a gravediscomfiture. The charm was there again, unmistakably, the little oldstrange, very simple charmto be expressed, as a fine proposition, or tobe given up; but the answer came in the fact that to have walked aboutfor half-an-hour was to have felt the question clear away. It clearedaway so conveniently, so blissfully, in the light of the benign littletruth that nothing had been less possible, even in the early, ingenuous,infatuated days, than to describe or define Newport. It had clearly hadnothing about it _to_ describe or define, so that ones fondness hadfairly rested on this sweet oddity in it. One had only to look back torecognize that it had never condescended to give a scrap of reasonedaccount of itself (as a favourite of fortune and the haunt of the_raffin_); it had simply lain there like a little bare, white, openhand, with slightly-parted fingers, for the observer with a presumedsense for hands to take or to leave. The observer with a real sensenever failed to pay this image the tribute of quite tenderly graspingthe hand, and even of raising it, delicately, to his lips; having noless, at the same time, the instinct of not shaking it too hard, andthat above all of never putting it to any rough work.Such had been from the first, under a chastened light and in a purplesea, the dainty isle of Aquidneck; which might have avoided the weakmistake of giving up its pretty native name and of becoming thereby asgood as namelesswith an existence as Rhode Island practicallymonopolized by the State and a Newport identity borrowed at the best andapplicable but to a corner. Does not this vagueness of condition,however, fitly symbolize the small virtual promontory, of which,superficially, nothing could be predicated but its sky and its sea andits sunsets? One views it as placed there, by some refinement in thescheme of nature, just as a touchstone of tastewith a beautiful littlesense to be read into it by a few persons, and nothing at all to be madeof it, as to its essence, by most others. I come back, for its essence,to that figure of the little white hand, with the gracefully-spreadfingers and the fine grain of skin, even the dimples at the joints andthe shell-like delicacy of the pink nailsall the charms in short that alittle white hand may have. I see all the applications of the imageIsee a special truth in each. It is the back of the hand, rising to theswell of the wrist, that is exposedwhich is the way, I think, the truelover takes and admires it. He makes out in it, bending over itor heused to in the old daysinnumerable shy and subtle beauties, almostrequiring, for justice, a magnifying-glass; and he winces at the sightof certain other obtruded ways of dealing with it. The touchstone oftaste was indeed to operate, for the critical, the tender spirit, fromthe moment the pink palm was turned up on the chance of what might bein it. For nine persons out of ten, among its visitors, its purchasersof sites and builders of (in the old parlance) cottages, there had neverbeen anything in it at allexcept of course an opportunity: anopportunity for escaping the summer heat of other places, for bathing,for boating, for riding and driving, and for many sorts of more or lessexpensive riot. The pink palm being empty, in other words, to theirvision, they had begun, from far back, to put things into it, things oftheir own, and of all sorts, and of many ugly, and of more and moreexpensive, sorts; to fill it substantially, that is, with gold, the goldthat they have ended by heaping up there to an amount so oddly out ofproportion to the scale of nature and of space.This process, one was immediately to perceive with that renewal ofimpression, this process of injection and elaboration, of creating thepalpable pile, had been going on for years to such a tune that the faceof nature was now as much obliterated as possible, and the original shysweetness as much as possible bedizened and bedevilled: all of which,moreover, might also at present be taken as having led, in turn, to themost unexpected climax, a matter of which I shall presently speak. Theoriginal shy sweetness, however, that range of effect which I havereferred to as practically too latent and too modest for notation, hadmeanwhile had its votaries, the fond pedestrian minority, for whom thelittle white hand (to return for an instant to my figure, with which, asyou see, I am charmed) had always been so full of treasures of its ownas to discredit, from the point of view of taste, any attempt, fromwithout, to stuff it fuller. Such attempts had, in the nature of thecase, and from far back, been condemned to show for violations;violations of taste and discretion, to begin withviolations, moreintimately, as the whole business became brisker, of a thousand delicatesecret places, dear to the disinterested rambler, small, mild pointsand promontories, far away little lonely, sandy coves, rock-set,lily-sheeted ponds, almost hidden, and shallow Arcadian summer-hauntedvalleys, with the sea just over some stony shoulder: a whole world thatcalled out to the long afternoons of youth, a world with its scale someasured and intended and happy, its detail so finished and pencilledand stippled (certainly for American detail!) that there comes back tome, across the many years, no better analogy for it than that of somefine foreground in an old line engraving. There remained always asense, of course, in which the superimpositions, the multipliedexcrescences, were a tribute to the value of the place; where no suchliberty was ever taken save exactly _because_ (as even the mostblundering builder would have claimed) it was all so beautiful, sosolitary and so sympathetic. And that indeed has been, thanks to thepilers-on of gold, the fortune, the history of its beauty: that it nowbristles with the villas and palaces into which the cottages have allturned, and that these monuments of pecuniary power rise thick andclose, precisely, in order that their occupants may constantly remark toeach other, from the windows to the grounds, and from house to house,that it _is_ beautiful, it _is_ solitary and sympathetic. The thing hasbeen done, it is impossible not to perceive, with the best faith in theworldthough not altogether with the best light, which is always sodifferent a matter; and it is with the general consequence only, at theend of the story, that I find myself to-day concerned.So much concerned I found myself, I profess, after I had taken in thisfact of a very distinct general consequence, that the whole interest ofthe vision was quickened by it; and that when, in particular, on one ofthe last days of June, among the densely-arrayed villas, I had followedthe beautiful ocean drive to its uttermost reach and back withoutmeeting either another vehicle or a single rider, let alone a singlepedestrian, I recognized matter for the intellectual thrill that attestsa social revolution foreseen and completed. The term I use may appearextravagant, but it was a fact, none the less, that I seemed to takefull in my face, on this occasion, the cold stir of air produced whenthe whirligig of time has made one of its liveliest turns. It is alwaysgoing, the whirligig, but its effect is so to blow up the dust that wemust wait for it to stop a moment, as it now and then does with a pantof triumph, in order to see what it has been at. I saw, beyond alldoubt, on the spotand _there_ came in, exactly, the thrill; I couldremember far back enough to have seen it begin to blow all the artlessbuyers and builders and blunderers into their places, leaving them therefor half a century or so of fond security, and then to see it, of asudden, blow them quite out again, as with the happy consciousness ofsome new amusing use for them, some other game still to play with them.This acquaintance, as it practically had been, with the whole roundingof the circle (even though much of it from a distance), was tantamountto the sense of having sat out the drama, the social, the local, that ofa real American period, from the rise to the fall of the curtainalwaysassuming that truth of the reached catastrophe or _dnouement_. _How_this climax or solution had been arrived atthat, clearly, for thespectator, would have been worth taking note of; but what he made of itI shall not glance at till I have shown him as first of all, on thespot, quite modestly giving in to mere primary beguilement. It had beencertain in advance that he would find the whole picture overpainted, andthe question could only be, at the best, of how much of the ancientsurface would here and there glimmer through. The ancient surface hadbeen the concern, as I have hinted, of the small fond minority, thecomparatively few people for whom the lurking shy charm, all there, butall to be felt rather than published, did in fact constitute a surface.The question, as soon as one arrived, was of whether some ghost of thatwere recoverable.                                   IIThere was always, to begin with, the Old Townwe used, before we hadbecome Old ourselves, to speak of it that way, in the manner of anallusion to Nuremberg or to Carcassonne, since it had been leading itslittle historic life for centuries (as we implied) before cottages andhouse-agents were dreamed of. It was not that we had great illusionsabout it or great pretensions for it; we only thought it, withoutinterference, very good of its kind, and we had as to its _being_ ofthat kind no doubt whatever. Would it still be of that kind, and whathad the kind itself been?these questions made ones heart beat fasteras one went forth in search of it. Distinctly, if it had been of a kindit _would_ still be of it; for the kind wouldnt at the worst or at thebest (one scarce knew how to put it) have been worth changing: so thatthe question for the restored absentee, who so palpitated with the senseof it, all hung, absolutely, on the validity of the past. One might wellhold ones breath if the past, with the dear little blue distances init, were in danger now of being given away. One might well pause beforethe possible indication that a cherished impression of youth had beenbut a figment of the mind. Fortunately, however, at Newport, andespecially where the antiquities cluster, distances are short, and thenote of reassurance awaited me almost round the first corner. One hadbeen a hundred times rightfor how _was_ one to think of it all, as onewent on, if one didnt think of it as Old? There played before oneseyes again, in fine, in that unmistakable silvery shimmer, a particularproperty of the local air, the exquisite law of the relativetheapplication of which, on the spot, is required to make even such placesas Viterbo and Bagdad not seem new. One may sometimes be tired of theword, but anything that has succeeded in living long enough to becomeconscious of its _note_, is capable on occasion of making that noteeffectively sound. It _will_ sound, we gather, if we listen for it, andthe small silver whistle of the past, with its charming quaver of weakgaiety, quite played the tune I asked of it up and down the tiny, sunny,empty Newport vistas, perspectives coming to a stop like the very shortwalks of very old ladies. What indeed but little very old ladies didthey resemble, the little very old streets? with the same suggestion ofpresent timidity and frugality of life, the same implication in theirfew folds of drab, of mourning, of muslin still mysteriously starched,the implication of no adventure at any time, however far back, thatmightnt have been suitable to a lady.The whole low promontory, in its wider and remoter measurements, is aregion of jutting tide-troubled points, but we had admired the OldTown too for the emphasis of its peculiar point, _the_ Point; a quarterdistinguished, we considered, by a really refined interest. Here wouldhave been my misadventure, if I was to have anythat of missing, on thegrey page of to-day, the suggestive passages I remembered; but I was tofind, to my satisfaction, that there was still no more mistaking theirpleasant sense than there had ever been: a quiet, mild waterside sense,not that of the bold, bluff outer sea, but one in which shores andstrands and small coast things played the greater part; with overhangingback verandahs, with little private wooden piers, with paintedboat-houses and boats laid up, with still-water bathing (the very words,with their old slightly prim discrimination, as of ladies and childrenjumping up and down, reach me across the years), with a wide-curving Bayand dim landward distances that melted into a mysterious, rich,superior, but quite disconnected and not at all permittedly patronizingProvidence. There were stories, anciently, for the Pointso prescribed afeature of it that one made them up, freely and handsomely, when theywere not otherwise to be come by; though one was never quite sure ifthey ought most to apply to the rather blankly and grimly Colonialhouses, fadedly drab at their richest and mainly, as the legend ran,appurtenant to that Quaker race whom Massachusetts and Connecticut hadprehistorically cast forth and the great Roger Williams had handsomelywelcomed, or to the other habitations, the felicitous cottages, withtheir galleries on the Bay and toward the sunset, their pleasure-boatsat their little wharves, and the supposition, that clung to them, oftheir harbouring the less fashionable of the outer Great, but also themore cultivated and the more artistic. Everything was there still, as Isay, and quite as much as anything the prolonged echo of that ingenuousold-time distinction. It was a marvel, no doubt, that the handful oflight elements I have named should add up to any total deserving thename of _picture_, and if I must produce an explanation I seek it with acertain confidence in the sense of the secret enjoyed by that air forbathing or, as one figures, for dipping, the objects it deals with. Ittakes them uninteresting, but feels immediately what submersion can dofor them; tips them in, keeps them down, holds them under, just for theproper length of time: after which they come up, as I say, irradiatingvague silverthe reflection of which I have perhaps here been trying tocatch even to extravagance.I did nothing, at any rate, all an autumn morning, but discover againhow good everything had beenpositively better than one had venturedto suppose in ones care to make the allowance for ones youngsimplicity. Some things indeed, clearly, had been better than one knew,and now seemed to surpass any fair probability: else why, for instance,should I have been quite awestruck by the ancient State House thatoverlooks the ancient Parade?an edifice ample, majestic, archaic, ofthe finest proportions and full of a certain public Dutch dignity,having brave, broad, high windows, in especial, the distinctness ofwhose innumerable square white-framed panes is the recall of some streetview of Haarlem or Leyden. Here was the charming impression of atreasure of antiquity to the vague image of which, through the years,one hadnt done justiceany more than one had done it, positively, tothree or four of the other old-time ornaments of the Parade (which, withits wide, cobbly, sleepy space, of those years, in the shadow of theState House, must have been much more of a Van der Heyden, or somebodyof that sort, than one could have dreamed). There was a treasure ofmodernity to reckon with, in the form of one of the Commodores Perry(they are somehow much multiplied at Newport, and quite monumentallyubiquitous) engaged in his great naval act; but this was swept away inthe general flood of justice to be done. I continued to do it all overthe place, and I remember doing it next at a certain ample old-timehouse which used to unite with the still prettier and archaic Vernon,near it, to form an honourable pair. In this mild town-corner, where itwas so indicated that the grass should be growing between the primitivepaving-stones, and where indeed I honestly think it mainly is, amidwhatever remains of them, ancient peace had appeared formerly toreignthough attended by the ghost of ancient war, inasmuch as these hadindubitably been the haunts of our auxiliary French officers during theRevolution, and no self-respecting legend could fail to report that itwas in the Vernon house Washington would have visited Rochambeau. Therehad hung about this structure, which is, architecturally speaking, allrusticated and indefinable decency, the implication of an inward charmthat refined even on its outward, and this was the tantalizing messageits clean, serious windows, never yet debased, struck me as stillgiving. But it was still (something told me) a question of not putting,anywhere, too many presumptions to the touch; so that my hand quittedthe knocker when I was on the point of a tentative tap, and I fell backon the neighbour and mate, as to which there was unforgottenacquaintance to teach me certainty. Here, alas, cold change wasinstalled; the place had become a public officenone of the artisticsuper-civilized, no _raffin_ of them all, among the passing fanciers orcollectors, having, strangely enough, marked it for his own. This mentalappropriation it is, or it was a few months ago, really impossible notto make, at sight of its delightful hall and almost grand staircase,its charming recessed, cupboarded, window-seated parlours, its generalpanelled amplitude and dignity: the due taster of such things puttinghimself straight into possession on the spot, and, though wondering atthe indifference and neglect, breathing thanks for the absence ofpositive ravage. For me there were special ghosts on the staircase,known voices in the brown old roomspresences that one would have liked,however, to call a little to account. People dont do those things;people didnt let so clear a caseclear for sound curiositygo likethat; they didnt, somehow, even if they were only ghosts. But I thoughttoo, as I turned away, of all the others of the foolish, or at least ofthe responsible, those who for so long have swarmed in the modernquarter and who make profession of the finer sense.This impression had been disturbing, but it had served its purpose inreconstituting, with a touch, a linkin laying down again every inch ofthe train of association with the human, the social, personal Newport ofwhat I may call the middle years. To go further afield, to measure thelength of the little old Avenue and tread again the little oldcliff-walk, to hang over, from above, the little old white crescent ofthe principal bathingsands, with the big pond, behind them, set in itsstonewalled featureless fields; to do these things and many others,every one of them thus accompanied by the admission that all that _had_been had been little, was to feel dead and buried generations push offeven the transparence of their shroud and get into motion for thepeopling of a scene that a present posterity has outgrown. The companyof the middle years, the so considerably prolonged formative, tentative,imaginative Newport time, hadnt outgrown itthis catastrophe was stillto come, as it constitutes, precisely, the striking dramatic_dnouement_ I have already referred to. American societyso far as thatfree mixture was to have arrived at cohesionhad for half a centurytaken its whole relation with the place seriously (which was byintention very gaily); it long remained, for its happiness, quite at onewith this most favoured resort of its comparative innocence. In theattesting presence of all the constant elements, of natural conditionsthat have, after all, persisted more than changed, a hundred far-awaypassages of the extinct life and joy, and of the comparative innocence,came back to me with an inevitable grace. A glamour as of the flushedends of beautiful old summers, making a quite rich medium, a red sunsethaze, as it were, for a processional throng of charioteers and riders,fortunate folk, fortunate above all in their untouched good faith,adjourning from the pleasures of the day to those of the eveningthisbenignity in particular overspread the picture, hanging it there as theNewport aspect that most lived again. Those good people all could makediscoveries within the frame itselfbeginning of course to push it out,in all directions, so as sufficiently to enlarge it, as they fondlyfancied, even for the experience of a sophisticated world. They dancedand they drove and they rode, they dined and wined and dressed andflirted and yachted and polod and Casinod, responding to the subtlestinventions of their age; on the old lawns and verandahs I saw themgather, on the old shining sands I saw them gallop, past the lowheadlands I saw their white sails verily flash, and through the duskyold shrubberies came the light and sound of their feasts.It had all been in truth a historyfor the imagination that could takeit so; and when once that kindly stage was offered them it was a wonderhow many figures and faces, how many names and voices, images andembodiments of youth mainly, and often of Beauty, and of felicity andfortune almost always, or of what then passed for such, pushed, under myeyes, in blurred gaiety, to the front. Hadnt it been above all, in itsgood faith, the Age of Beautiesthe blessed age when it was so easy to_be_, on the Avenue, a Beauty, and when it was so easy, not less, notto doubt of the unsurpassability of such as appeared there? It wasthrough the fact that the whole scheme and opportunity satisfied them,the fact that the place was, as I say, good enough for themit wasthrough this that, with ingenuities and audacities and refinements oftheir own (some of the more primitive of which are still touching tothink of) they extended the boundaries of civilization, and fairlytaught themselves to believe they were doing it in the interest ofnature. Beautiful the time when the Ocean Drive had been hailed at onceas a triumph of civilization and as a proof of the possible appeal ofScenery even to the dissipated. It was spoken of as of almost boundlessextentas one of the wonders of the world; as indeed it does turn often,in the gloaming, to purple and gold, and as the small sea-coves thengleam on its edge like barbaric gems on a mantle. Yet if it was aquestion of waving the wand and of breathing again, till it stirred, onthe quaintness of the old mannersI refer to those of the fifties,sixties, seventies, and dont exclude those of the eightiesit was mosttouching of all to go back to dimmest days, days, such as now appearantediluvian, when ocean-drives, engineered by landscape artists andliterally macadamized all the way, were still in the lap of time; whenthere was only an afternoon for the Fort, and another for the Beach, andanother for the Boat-houseinconceivable innocence!and even theshortness of the Avenue seemed very long, and even its narrowness verywide, and even its shabbiness very promising for the future, and when,in fine, chariots and cavaliers took their course, across country, toBatemans, by inelegant precarious tracts and returned, through thedarkling void, with a sense of adventure and fatigue. That, I cant butthink, was the _pure_ Newport time, the most perfectly guarded by asense of margin and of mystery.It was the time of settled possession, and yet furthest removed fromthese blank days in which margin has been consumed and the palaces, onthe sites but the other day beyond price, stare silently seaward,monuments to the _blas_ state of their absent proprietors. Purer still,however, I remind myself, was that stretch of years which I have reasonsfor thinking sacred, when the custom of seeking hibernation on the spotpartly prevailed, when the local winter inherited something of the bestsocial grace (as it liked at least to think) of the splendid summer, andwhen the strange sight might be seen of a considerable company ofAmericans, not gathered at a mere rest-cure, who confessed brazenly tonot being in business. Do I grossly exaggerate in saying that thiscompany, candidly, quite excitedly self-conscious, as all companies notcommercial, in America, may be pleasantly noted as being, formed, forthe time of its persistence, an almost unprecedented smallbodyunprecedented in American conditions; a collection of the detached,the slightly disenchanted and casually disqualified, and yet of theresigned and contented, of the socially orthodox: a handful of mild, ohdelightfully mild, cosmopolites, united by three common circumstances,that of their having for the most part more or less lived in Europe,that of their sacrificing openly to the ivory idol whose name isleisure, and that, not least, of a formed critical habit. These thingshad been felt as making them excrescences on the American surface, wherenobody ever criticized, especially after the grand tour, and where thegreat black ebony god of business was the only one recognized. So I seethem, at all events, in fond memory, lasting as long as they could andfinding no successors; and they are most embalmed for me, I confess, inthat scented, somewhat tattered, but faintly spiced, wrapper of theirvarious European antecedents. I see them move about in the light ofthese, and I understand how it was this that made them ask what wouldhave become of them, and where in the world, the hard American world,they _could_ have hibernated, how they could even, in the Season, havebowed their economic heads and lurked, if it hadnt been for Newport. Ithink of that question as, in their reduced establishments, over theirwinter whist, under their private theatricals, and pending, constantly,their loan and their return of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, their mainconversational note. I find myself in fact tenderly evoking them asspecial instances of the greator perhaps I have a right only to say ofthe smallAmerican complication; the state of ones having been sopierced, betimes, by the sharp outland dart as to be able everafterwards but to move about, vaguely and helplessly, with the shaftstill in ones side.Their nostalgia, however exquisite, was, I none the less gather,sterile, for they appear to have left no seed. They must have died, someof them, in order to go backto go back, that is, to Paris. If I make,at all events, too much of them, it is for their propriety as a delicatesubjective value matching with the intrinsic Newport delicacy. They musthave felt that they, obviously, notably, notoriously, did matchtheproof of which was in the fact that to them alone, of the customarythousands, was the beauty of the good walk, over the lovely little land,revealed. The customary thousands here, as throughout the United States,never set foot to earthyet this had happened so, of old, to be theparticular corner of _their_ earth that made that adventure mostpossible. At Newport, as the phrase was, in autumnal, in vernalhibernation, you _could_ walkfailing which, in fact, you failed ofimpressions the most consolatory; and it is mainly to the far ends ofthe low, densely shrubbed and perfectly finished little headlands that Isee our friends ramble as if to stretch fond arms across the sea. Thereused to be distant places beyond Batemans, or better still on theopposite isle of Conanicut, now blighted with ugly uses, where nursing anostalgia on the sun-warmed rocks was almost as good as having none atall. So it was not only not our friends who had overloaded andovercrowded, but it was they at last, I infer, who gave way before thatgrossness. How should they have wished to leave seed only to be trampledby the white elephants?The white elephants, as one may best call them, all cry and no wool, allhouse and no garden, make now, for three or four miles, a barelyinterrupted chain, and I dare say I think of them best, and of thedistressful, inevitable waste they represent, as I recall the impressionof a divine little drive, roundabout them and pretty well everywhere,taken, for renewal of acquaintance, while November was still mild. Isought another renewal, as I have intimated, in the vacant splendour ofJune, but the interesting evidence then only refined on that alreadygathered. The place itself, as manand often, no doubt, alas, as woman,with her love of the immediate and contiguoushad taken it over, wasmore than ever, to the fancy, like some dim, simplified ghost of a smallGreek island, where the clear walls of some pillared portico orpavilion, perched afar, looked like those of temples of the gods, andwhere Nature, deprived of that ease in merely massing herself on whichAmerican scenery, as we lump it together, is too apt to depend for itseffect, might have shown a piping shepherd on any hillside or attached amythic image to any point of rocks. What an idea, originally, to haveseen this miniature spot of earth, where the sea-nymphs on the curvedsands, at the worst, might have chanted back to the shepherds, as a merebreeding-ground for white elephants! They look queer and conscious andlumpishsome of them, as with an air of the brandished proboscis, reallygrotesquewhile their averted owners, roused from a witless dream,wonder what in the world is to be done with them. The answer to which, Ithink, can only be that there is absolutely nothing to be done; nothingbut to let them stand there always, vast and blank, for reminder tothose concerned of the prohibited degrees of witlessness, and of thepeculiarly awkward vengeances of affronted proportion and discretion.                                  VII                                 BOSTONIt sometimes uncomfortably happens for a writer, consulting hisremembrance, that he remembers too much and finds himself knowing hissubject too well; which is but the case of the bottle too full for thewine to start. There has to be room for the air to circulate betweenones impressions, between the parts of ones knowledge, since it is theair, or call it the intervals on the sea of ones ignorance, of onesindifference, that sets these floating fragments into motion. This ismore or less what I feel in presence of the invitationeven theinvitation written on the very face of the place itself, of its actualaspects and appearancesto register my impression of Boston. Can one_have_, in the conditions, an impression of Boston, any that has notbeen for long years as inappreciable as a sunk picture?that deadstate of surface which requires a fresh application of varnish. Thesituation I speak of is the consciousness of old knowledge, knowledgeso compacted by the years as to be unable, like the bottled wine, toflow. The answer to such questions as these, no doubt, however, is thepractical one of trying a shake of the bottle or a brushful of thevarnish. My sunk sense of Boston found itself vigorously varnished bymere renewal of vision at the end of long years; though I confess thatunder this favouring influence I ask myself why I should have had, afterall, the notion of overlaid deposits of experience. The experience hadanciently been smallso far as smallness may be imputed to any of ourprime initiations; yet it had left consequences out of proportion to itslimited seeming self. Early contacts had been brief and few, and theslight bridge had long ago collapsed; wherefore the impressed conditionthat acquired again, on the spot, an intensity, struck me as but halfexplained by the inordinate power of assimilation of the imaginativeyoung. I should have had none the less to content myself with thisevidence of the magic of past sensibilities had not the questionsuddenly been lighted for me as by a sudden flicker of the torchand formy special benefitcarried in the hand of history. This light, wavingfor an instant over the scene, gave me the measure of my relation to it,both as to immense little extent and to quite subjective character.                                   IIt was in strictness only a matter of noting the harshness ofchangesince I scarce know what else to call iton the part of theapproaches to a particular spot I had wished to revisit. I made out,after a little, the entrance to Ashburton Place; but I missed on thatspacious summit of Beacon Hill more than I can say the pleasant littlecomplexity of the other time, marked with its share of the famousold-world crookedness of Boston, that element of the mildly tortuouswhich did duty, for the story-seeker, as an ancient and romantic note,and was half envied, half derided by the merely rectangular criticism.Didnt one remember the day when New Yorkers, when Philadelphians, whenpilgrims from the West, sated with their eternal equidistances, with thequadrilateral scheme of life, raved about Cornhill and appeared tofind in the rear of the State House a recall of one of thetopographical, the architectural jumbles of Europe or Asia? And did notindeed the small happy accidents of the disappearing Boston exhale in acomparatively sensible manner the warm breath of history, the history ofsomething as against the history of nothing?so that, being gone, orgenerally going, they enabled one at last to feel and almost to talkabout them as one had found ones self feeling and talking about thesacrificed relics of old Paris and old London. In this immediateneighbourhood of the enlarged State House, where a great raw clearancehas been made, memory met that pang of loss, knew itself sufficientlybereft to see the vanished objects, a scant but adequate cluster ofnooks, of such odds and ends as parochial schemes of improvement sweepaway, positively overgrown, within ones own spirit, by a wealth oflegend. There was at least the gain, at any rate, that one was now goingto be free to picture them, to embroider them, at ones easeto tanglethem up in retrospect and make the real romantic claim for them. Thisaccordingly is what I am doing, but I am doing it in particular for thesacrificed end of Ashburton Place, the Ashburton Place that I ancientlyknew. This eminently respectable by-way, on my return to question it,opened its short vista for me honestly enough, though looking ratherexposed and undermined, since the mouth of the passage to the west,formerly measured and narrow, had begun to yawn into space, a spacepeopled in fact, for the eye of appreciation, with the horrific glazedperpendiculars of the future. But the pair of ancient houses I was inquest of kept their tryst; a pleasant individual pair, mated withnothing else in the street, yet looking at that hour as if their oldstill faces had lengthened, their shuttered, lidded eyes had closed,their brick complexions had paled, above the good granite basements, toa fainter redall as with the cold consciousness of a possible doom.That possibility, on the spot, was not present to me, occupied as I waswith reading into one of them a short page of history that I had my ownreasons for finding of supreme interest, the history of two years offar-away youth spent there at a periodthe closing-time of the Warfullboth of public and of intimate vibrations. The two years had been thoseof a young mans, a very young mans earliest fond confidence in aliterary career, and the effort of actual attention was to recover onthe spot some echo of ghostly footstepsthe sound as of taps on thewindow-pane heard in the dim dawn. The place itself was meanwhile, atall events, a conscious memento, with old secrets to keep and oldstories to witness for, a saturation of life as closed together andpreserved in it as the scent lingering in a folded pocket-handkerchief.But when, a month later, I returned again (a justly-rebuked mistake) tosee if another whiff of the fragrance were not to be caught, I found buta gaping void, the brutal effacement, at a stroke, of every relatedobject, of the whole precious past. Both the houses had been levelledand the space to the corner cleared; hammer and pickaxe had evidentlybegun to swing on the very morrow of my previous visitwhich hadmoreover been precisely the imminent doom announced, without myunderstanding it, in the poor scared faces. I had been present, by theoddest hazard, at the very last moments of the victim in whom I was mostinterested; the act of obliteration had been breathlessly swift, and ifI had often seen how fast history could be made I had doubtless never sofelt that it could be unmade still faster. It was as if the bottom hadfallen out of ones own biography, and one plunged backward into spacewithout meeting anything. That, however, seemed just to give me, as Ihave hinted, the whole figure of my connection with everything about, aconnection that had been sharp, in spite of brevity, and then had brokenshort off. Thus it was the sense of the rupture, more than of anythingelse, that I was, and for a still much briefer time, to carry with me.It seemed to leave me with my early impression of the place on my hands,inapt, as might be, for use; so that I could only try, rather vainly, tofit it to present conditions, among which it tended to shrink and stray.It was on two or three such loitering occasions, wondering and invokingpauses that had, a little vaguely and helplessly perhaps, the changedcrest of Beacon Hill for their fieldit was at certain of these momentsof charged, yet rather chilled, contemplation that I felt my smallcluster of early associations shrivel to a scarce discernible point. Irecall a Sunday afternoon in particular when I hung about on the nowvaster platform of the State House for a near view of the militarymonuments erected there, the statues of Generals Hooker and Devens, andfor the charm at once and the pang of feeling the whole backward vista,with all its features, fall from that eminence into grey perspective.The top of Beacon Hill quite rakes, with a but slightly shifting range,the old more definite Boston; for there seemed no item, nor any number,of that remarkable sum that it would not anciently have helped one todistinguish or divine. There all these things essentially were at themoment I speak of, but only again as something ghostly and dim,something overlaid and smothered by the mere modern thickness. Ilingered half-an-hour, much of the new disposition of the elements hereinvolved being duly impressive, and the old uplifted front of the StateHouse, surely, in its spare and austere, its ruled and pencilled kind, athing of beauty, more delightful and harmonious even than I hadremembered it; one of the inestimable values again, in the eye of thetown, for taste and temperance, as the perfectly felicitous ParkStreet Church hard by, was another. The irresistible spell, however, Ithink, was something sharper yetthe coercion, positively, of feelingones case, the case of ones deeper discomfiture, completely made out.The day itself, toward the winters end, was all benignant, like theimmense majority of the days of the American year, and there wentforward across the top of the hill a continuous passage of men andwomen, in couples and talkative companies, who struck me as labouringwage-earners, of the simpler sort, arrayed, very comfortably, in theirSunday best and decently enjoying their leisure. They came up as fromover the Common, they passed or they paused, exchanging remarks on thebeauty of the scene, but rapidly presenting themselves to me as of moreinterest, for the moment, than anything it contained.For no sound of English, in a single instance, escaped their lips; thegreater number spoke a rude form of Italian, the others some outlanddialect unknown to methough I waited and waited to catch an echo ofantique refrains. No note of any shade of American speech struck my ear,save in so far as the sounds in question represent to-day so much of thesubstance of that idiom. The types and faces bore them out; the peoplebefore me were gross aliens to a man, and they were in serene andtriumphant possession. Nothing, as I say, could have been more effectivefor figuring the hitherward bars of a grating through which I might makeout, far off in space, my small homogeneous Boston of the moreinteresting time. It was not of course that our gross little aliens wereimmediate social figures in the narrower sense of the term, or thatany personal commerce of which there might be question could colouritself, to its detriment, from their presence; but simply that theyexpressed, as everywhere and always, the great cost at which every placeon my list had become braver and louder, and that they gave the measureof the distance by which the general movement was _away_away, alwaysand everywhere, from the old presumptions and conceivabilities. Boston,the bigger, braver, louder Boston, was away, and it was quite, at thathour, as if each figure in my procession were there on purpose to leaveme no doubt of it. Therefore had I the vision, as filling the sky, nolonger of the great Puritan whip, the whip for the conscience and thenerves, of the local legend, but that of a huge applied sponge, a spongesaturated with the foreign mixture and passed over almost everything Iremembered and might still have recovered. The detail of thisobliteration would take me too far, but I had even then (on a previousday as well as only half-an-hour before) caught at something that mightstand for a vivid symbol of the general effect of it. To come up fromSchool Street into Beacon was to approach the Athenumexquisiteinstitution, to fond memory, joy of the aspiring prime; yet to approachthe Athenum only to find all disposition to enter it drop as dead as iffrom quick poison, what did _that_ denote but the dreadful chill ofchange, and of the change in especial that was most completely dreadful?For had not this honoured haunt of all the most civilizedlibrary,gallery, temple of culture, the place that was to Boston at large asBoston at large was to the rest of New Englandhad it not with peculiarintensity had a value, the most charming of its kind, no doubt, in allthe huge country, and had not this value now, evidently, been brought solow that one shrank, in delicacy, from putting it to the test?It was a case of the detestable tall building again, and of itsinstant destruction of quality in everything it overtowers. Putcompletely out of countenance by the mere masses of brute uglinessbeside it, the temple of culture looked only rueful and snubbed,hopelessly down in the world; so that, far from being moved to hover orto penetrate, ones instinct was to pass by on the other side, avertingones head from an humiliation one could do nothing to make less. Andthis indeed though one would have liked to do something; the brutemasses, above the comparatively small refined facade (one saw how happyone had always thought it) having for the inner ear the voice of a pairof school-bullies who hustle and pummel some studious little boy.Exquisite was what they called you, eh? Well teach you, then, littlesneak, to be exquisite! We allow none of that rot round here. It washeart-breaking, this presentation of a Boston practically void of anAthenum; though perhaps not without interest as showing how much onesown sense of the small city of the earlier time had been dependent onthat institution. I found it of no use, at any rate, to think, for acompensatory sign of the new order, of the present Public Library; thepresent Public Library, however remarkable in its pomp and circumstance,and of which I had at that hour received my severe impression, beingneither exquisite nor on the way to become soa difficult, an impassableway, no doubt, for Public Libraries. Nor did I cast about, in fact, veryearnestly, for consolationso much more was I held by the vision of theclosed order which shaped itself, continually, in the light of thediffering present; an order gaining an interest for this backward viewprecisely as one felt that all the parts and tokens of it, while itlasted, had hung intimately together. Missing those parts and tokens, oras many of them as one could, became thus a constant slightly painfuljoy: it made them fall so into their place as items of the oldcharacter, or proofs, positively, as one might say, of the olddistinction. It was impossible not to see Park Street itself, forinstancewhile I kept looking at the matter from my more swaggerhilltop as violently vulgarized; and it was incontestable that, whatevermight be said, there had anciently not been, on the whole continent,taking everything together, an equal animated space more exempt fromvulgarity. There had probably been comparable spacesimpressions, in NewYork, in Philadelphia, in Baltimore, almost as good; but only almost, byreason of their lacking (which was just the point) the indefinableperfection of Park Street.It seems odd to have to borrow from the French the right word in thisassociationor would seem so, rather, had it been less often indicatedthat that people have better names than ours even for the qualities weare apt to suppose ourselves more in possession of than they. ParkStreet, in any case, had been magnificently _honnte_the very type andmodel, for a pleasant street-view, of the character. The aspects thatmight elsewhere have competed were _honntes_ and weak, whereas ParkStreet was _honnte_ and strongstrong as founded on _all_ the moral,material, social solidities, instead of on some of them only; which madeagain all the difference. Personal names, as notes of that largeemanation, need scarcely be invokedthey might even have a weakeningeffect; the force of the statement was in its collective, cumulativelook, as if each member of the row, from the church at the TremontStreet angle to the amplest, squarest, most purple presence at theBeacon Street corner (where it always had a little the air of a sturdyproprietor with back to the fire, legs apart and thumbs in the armholesof an expanse of high-coloured plush waistcoat), was but a syllable inthe word Respectable several times repeated. One had somehow never heardit uttered with so convincing an emphasis. But the shops, up and down,are making all this as if it had never been, pleasant premises as theyhave themselves acquired; and it was to strike me from city to city, Ifear, that the American shop in general pleads but meagrelywhether onits outer face or by any more intimate artfor indulgence to itstendency to swarm, to bristle, to vociferate. The shop-front, observedat random, produced on me from the first, and almost everywhere alike, asingular, a sinister impression, which left me uneasy till I had found aname for it: the sense of an economic law of which one had not for yearsknown the unholy rigour, the vision of protected production and ofcommodities requiring certainly, in many cases, every advantageProtection could give them. They looked to me always, these exhibitions,consciously and defiantly protectedinsolently safe, able to be withimpunity anything they would; and when once that lurid light had settledon them I could see them, I confess, in none other; so that the objectscomposing them fell, throughout, into a vicious and villainouscategoryquite as if audibly saying: Oh come; dont look among us forwhat you wont, for what you shant find, the best quality attainable;but only for that quite other matter, the best value we allow you. Youmust take us or go without, and if you feel your nose thus held to thegrindstone by the hard fiscal hand, its no more than you deserve forharbouring treasonable thoughts.So it was, therefore, that while the imagination and the memorystrayedstrayed away to other fiscal climates, where the fruits ofcompetition so engagingly ripen and flushthe streets affected one atmoments as a prolonged show-case for every arrayed vessel ofhumiliation. The fact that several classes of the protected productsappeared to consist of articles that one might really anywhere havepreferred did little, oddly enough, to diminish the sense of severediscipline awaiting the restored absentee on contact with theseoccasions of traffic. The discipline indeed is general, proceeding as itdoes from so many sources, but it earns its name, in particular, fromthe predicament of the ingenuous inquirer who asks himself if he canreally bear the combination of such general manners and such generalprices, of such general prices and such general manners. He has ahelpless bewildered moment during which he wonders if he mightnt bearthe prices a little better if he were a little better addressed, or bearthe usual form of address a little better if the prices were inthemselves, given the commodity offered, a little less humiliating tothe purchaser. Neither of these elements of his dilemma strikes him aslikely to abatethe general cost of the things to drop, or the generalgrimness of the person he deals with over the counter to soften; so thathe reaches out again for balm to where he has had to seek it under otherwounds, falls back on the cultivation of patience and regret, on largeinternational comparison. He is confronted too often, to his sense, withthe question of what may be borne; but what does he see about him ifnot a vast social order in which the parties to certain relations areall the while marvellously, inscrutably, desperately bearing eachother? He may wonder, at his hours, how, under the strain, socialcohesion does not altogether give way; but that is another question,which belongs to a different plane of speculation. For he asks himselfquite as much as anything else how the shopman or the shoplady can bearto be barked at in the manner he constantly hears used to them bycustomershe recognizes that no agreeable form of intercourse _could_survive a day in such air: so that what is the only relation findingground there but a necessary vicious circle of gross mutual endurance?These reflections connect themselves moreover with that most general ofhis restless hauntings in the United Statesnot only with the lapse ofall wonderment at the immense number of absentees unrestored and makingtheir lives as they may in other countries, but with the preliminaryAmerican postulate or basis for any successful accommodation of life.This basis is that of active pecuniary gain and of active pecuniary gainonlythat of ones making the conditions so triumphantly pay that theprices, the manners, the other inconveniences, take their place as afriction it is comparatively easy to salve, wounds directly treatablewith the wash of gold. What prevails, what sets the tune, is theAmerican scale of gain, more magnificent than any other, and the factthat the whole assumption, the whole theory of life, is that of theindividuals participation in it, that of his being more or lesspunctually and more or less effectually squared. To make so much moneythat you wont, that you dont mind, dont mind anythingthat isabsolutely, I think, the main American formula. Thus your making nomoneyor so little that it passes there for noneand being therebydistinctly reduced to minding, amounts to your being reduced to theknowledge that America is no place for you. To mind as one minds, forinstance, in Europe, under provocation or occasion offered, and yet tohave to live under the effect of American pressure, is speedily toperceive that the knot can be untied but by a definite pull of one orthe other string. The immense majority of people pull, luckily for theexisting order, the string that consecrates their connection with it;the minority (small, however, only in comparison) pull the string thatloosens that connection. The existing order is meanwhile safe, inasmuchas the faculty of making money is in America the commonest of all andfairly runs the streets: so simple a matter does it appear there, amongvast populations, to make betimes enough _not_ to mind. Yet thewithdrawal of the considerable group of the pecuniarily disqualifiedseems no less, for the present, an assured movement; there will alwaysbe scattered individuals condemned to mind on a scale beyond any scaleof making. The relation of this modest body to the country of theirbirth, which asks so much, on the wholeso many surrenders andcompromises, and the possession above all of such a prodigious head forfiguresbefore it begins, in its wonderful way, to give or to pay,would appear to us supremely touching, I think, as a case of communionbaffled and blighted, if we had time to work it out. It would bathe insomething of a tragic light the vivid truth that the great countriesare all, more and more, happy lands (so far as any can be called such)for any, for every sort of person rather than the middle sort. The uppersortin the scale of wealth, the only scale nowcan to their heartscontent build their own castles and move by their own motors; the lowersort, masters of gain in _their_ degree, can profit, also to theirhearts content, by the enormous extension of those material facilitieswhich may be gregariously enjoyed; they are able to rush about, as neverunder the sun before, in promiscuous packs and hustled herds, while tothe act of so rushing about all felicity and prosperity appear for themto have been comfortably reduced. The frustrated American, as I havehinted at him, scraping for _his_ poor practical solution in thedepleted silver-mine of history, is the American who makes too littlefor the castle and yet minds too much for the hustled herd, who canneither achieve such detachment nor surrender to such society, and whomost of all accordingly, in the native order, fails of a working basis.The salve, the pecuniary salve, in Europe, is sensibly less, but less onthe other hand also the excoriation that makes it necessary, whetherfrom above or below.                                   IILet me at all events say for the Park Street Church, while I may still,on my hilltop, keep more or less in line with it, that this edificepersistently holds the note, as yet, the note of the old felicity, andremains by so doing a precious public servant. Strange enough,doubtless, to find ones self pleading sanctity for a theologicalstructure sanctified only by such a nameas who should say the ParkStreet Hotel or the Park Street Post-office; so much clearer would theclaim seem to come were it the case of another St. Clement Danes or ofanother St. Mary-le-Strand. But in America we get our sanctity as wecan, and we plead it, if we are wise, wherever the conditions suffer thefaintest show of colour for it to flush through. Again and again it is aquestion, on behalf of the memorial object (and especially whenpreservation is at stake), of an interest and an appeal proceedingexactly _from_ the conditions, and thereby not of an absolute, but of arelative force and weight; which is exactly the state of the matter withthe Park Street Church. This happy landmark is, in strictness, with itsmild recall, by its spire, of Wrens bold London examples, thecomparatively thin echo of a far-away songplaying its part, however,for harmonious effect, as perfectly as possible. It is admirably placed,quite peculiarly _present_, on the Boston scene, and thus, for onereason and another, points its moral as not even the State House does.So we see afresh, under its admonition, that charm is a flower of wildand windblown seedoften not to be counted on when most anxiouslyplanted, but taking its own time and its own place both for enrichingand for mocking us. It mocks assuredly, above all, our money and ourimpatience, elements addressed to buying or ordering it, and only asksthat when it does come we shall know it and love it. When we fail ofthis intelligence it simply, for its vengeance, boycotts usmakes usvulgar folk who have no concern with it. Then if we ever miss it we cannever get it backthough our deepest depth of punishment of course is togo on fatuously not missing it, the joy of ourselves and of each otherand the derision of those who know. These reflections were virtuallysuggested to me, on the eve of my leaving Boston, by ten words addressedto my dismay; the effect of which was to make Park Street Church, forthe hour, the most interesting mass of brick and mortar and (if I mayrisk the supposition) timber in America.The words had been spoken, in the bright July air, by a friendencountered in the very presence of the mild monument, on thefreshly-perceived value of which, for its position, for its civilfunction, I had happened irrepressibly to exclaim. Thus I learned thatits existence might be spoken of as gravely menacedmenaced by a schemefor the erection of a business-block, a huge square of innumerabletiers and floors, thousands of places of trade, the trade that in such aposition couldnt fail to be roaring. In the eye of financial envy thechurch was but a cumberer of the ground, and where, about us, had weseen financial envy fail when it had once really applied the push of itsfat shoulder? Drunk as it was with power, what was to be thought of asresisting it? This was a question, truly, to frighten answers awayuntilI presently felt the most pertinent of all return as if on tiptoe. Theperfect force of the case as a case, as an example, that was the answerof answers; the quite ideal pitch of the opportunity for virtue. Idealopportunities are rare, and this occasion for not sacrificing the highornament and cynosure of the town to the impudence of private greed justhappens to be one, and to have the finest marks of the character. Onehad but to imagine a civilized community reading these marks, feelingthat character, and then consciously and cynically falling below itsadmirable chance, to take in the impossibility of any such blot on thepage of honour, any such keen appetite for the base alternative. Itwould be verily the endthe end of the old distinguished life, of thecommon intelligence that had flowered formerly, for attesting fame, fromso strong a sap and into so thick and rich a cluster. One had thought ofthese things as one came and wentso interesting to-day in Boston aresuch informal consultations of the oracle (that of the very air andtone), such puttings to it of the question of what the old New Englandspirit may have still, intellectually, sthetically, or for that mattereven morally, to give; of what may yet remain, for productive scraping,of the formula of the native Puritanism educated, the formula oncecapacious enough for the literary constellation of the Age of Emerson.Is that cornucopia empty, or does some handful of strong or at leastsound fruit lurk to this day, a trifle congested by keeping, up in thepoint of the horn? What, if so, are, in the ambient air, the symptoms ofthis possibility? What are the signs of intellectual promise, poetic,prosaic, philosophic, in the current generations, those actuallylearning their principal lesson, as one assumes, from the greatUniversity hard by? The old formula, that of Puritanism educated, hasit, in fine, except for business, anything more to communicate?or dowe perhaps mistake the case in still speaking, by reason of theprojected shadow of Harvard, of education as at all involved?Oh, for business, for a commercial, an organizing energy of the firstorder, the indications would seem to abound; the air being full of themas of one loud voice, and nowhere so full perhaps as at that Park Streetcorner, precisely, where it was to be suggested to me that their meaningwas capable on occasion of turning to the sinister. The commercialenergy at least was educated, up to the eyesHarvard was still caringfor that more than for anything elsebut the wonderments, or perhapsrather the positive impressions I have glanced at, bore me constantcompany, keeping the last word, all emphasis of answer, back as if forthe creation of a dramatic suspense. I liked the suspense, none theless, for what it had in common with intellectual curiosity, and itgave me a light, moreover, which was highly convenient, helping me tolook at everything in some related state to this proposition of thevalue of the Puritan residuumthe question of whether value isexpressed, for instance, by the little tales, mostly by ladies, andabout and for children romping through the ruins of the Language, in themonthly magazines. Some of my perceptions of relation might seem forced,for other minds, but it sufficed me that they were straight and clearfor myselfstraight and clear again, for example, when (always on myhilltop and raking the prospect over for memories) I quite assented tothe tacit intimation that a long sthetic period had closed with thedisappearance of the old Museum Theatre. This had been the theatre ofthe great periodso far as such a description may fit an establishmentthat never produced during that term a play either by a Bostonian or byany other American; or it had at least, with however unequal steps, keptthe great period company, made the Boston of those years quitecomplacently participate in its genial continuity. This character of its_being_ an institution, its really being a theatre, with a repertory anda family of congruous players, not one of them the balefulactor-manager, head and front of all the so rank and so acclaimedvulgarities of our own daythis nature in it of not being the mere emptyshell, the indifferent cave of the winds, that yields a few nightslodging, under stress, to the passing caravan, gave it a dignity ofwhich I seemed to see the ancient city gratefully conscious, fond andjealous, and the thought of which invites me to fling over it nowperhaps too free a fold of the mantle of romance. And yet why too free?is what I ask myself as I remember that the Museum had for long years arepertorythe repertory of its agea company and a cohesion, theatricaltrifles of the cultivation of which no present temple of the drama fromend to end of the country appears to show a symptom. Therefore I spare asigh to its memory, and, though I doubtless scarce think of it as thehaunt of Emerson, of Hawthorne or of Mr. Ticknor, the common conscienceof the mid-century in the New England capital insists on showing, atthis distance of time, as the richer for it.That then was one of the missed elements, but the consequent melancholy,I ought promptly to add, formed the most appropriate soil for straysprouts of tenderness in respect to the few aspects that had notsuffered. The old charm of Mount Vernon Street, for instance, wanderingup the hill, almost from the waterside, to the rear of the State House,and fairly hanging about there to rest like some good flushed lady, ofmore than middle age, a little spent and blownthis ancient grace wasnot only still to be felt, but was charged, for depth of interest, withintenser ghostly presences, the rich growth of time, which might havemade the ample slope, as one mounted, appear as beautifully peopled asJacobs Ladder. That was exactly the kind of impression to be desiredand welcomed; since ghosts belong only to places and suffer and perishwith them. It was as if they themselves moreover were taking pleasure inthis place, fairly indeed commending to me the fine old style of thepicture. Nothing less appeared to account for my not having, in theother age, done it, as the phrase is, full justice, recognized in it soexcellent a peace, such a clear Boston braveryall to the end that itshould quite strike me, on the whole, as not only, for the minor stretchand the domestic note, the happiest street-scene the country could show,but as pleasant, on those respectable lines, in a degree not surpassedeven among outland pomps. Oh, the wide benignity of brick, the goodly,friendly, ruddy fronts, the felicity of scale, the solid _seat_ ofeverything, even to the handful of happy deviations from the regularproduced, we may fancy, by one of those historic causes which sorarely complicate, for humanization, the blankness of the Americanstreet-page, and the occasional occurrence of which, in general, as I amperhaps too repeatedly noting, excites on the part of the starvedstory-seeker a fantastic insistence. I find myself willing, after all,to let my whole estimate of these mere mild monuments of private worthpass for extravagant if it but leave me a perch for musing on the oddityof our nature which makes us still like the places we have known orloved to grow old, when we can scarcely bear it in the people. To walkdown Mount Vernon Street to Charles was to have a brush with that truth,to recognize at least that we like the sense of age to come, locally,when it comes with the right accompaniments, with the preservation ofcharacter and the continuity of tradition, merits I had been admiring onthe brow of the eminence. From the other vision, the sight of thedecline in the social scale, the lapse into shabbiness and into badcompany, we only suffer, for the ghosts in that case either refuse tolinger, or linger at the most with faces ashamed and as if appealingagainst their association.Such was the condition of the Charles Street ghosts, it seemed tomeshades of a past that had once been so thick and warm and happy; theymoved, dimly, through a turbid medium in which the signs of their oldlife looked soiled and sordid. Each of them was there indeed, from far,far back; they met me on the pavement, yet it was as if we could passbut in conscious silence, and nothing could have helped us, for anycourage of communion, if we had not enjoyed the one merciful refuge thatremained, where indeed we could breathe again, and with intensity, ourown liberal air. Here, behind the effaced anonymous door, was the littleark of the modern deluge, here still the long drawing-room that looksover the water and toward the sunset, with a seat for every visitingshade, from far-away Thackeray down, and relics and tokens so thick onits walls as to make it positively, in all the town, the votive templeto memory. Ah, if it hadnt been for _that_ small patch of commonground, with its kept echo of the very accent of the past, therevisiting spirit, at the bottom of the hill, could but have muffled hishead, or but have stifled his heart, and turned away for ever. Let meeven say thatalways now at the bottom of the hillit was in thispractical guise he afterwards, at the best, found himself roaming. It isfrom about that point southward that the new splendours of Bostonspread, and will clearly continue to spread, but it opened out to me asa tract pompous and prosaic, with which the little interesting city, thecity of character and genius, exempt as yet from the Irish yoke, had hadabsolutely nothing to do. This disconnection was complete, and thesouthward, the westward territory made up, at the most, a platform orstage from which the other, the concentrated Boston of history, theBoston of Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Lowell, Holmes,Ticknor, Motley, Prescott, Parkman and the rest (in the sense either ofbirthplace or of central or sacred city) could be seen in as definite,and indeed now in almost as picturesquely medival, a concretion, appearto make as black and minute and composed a little pyramidal image, asthe finished background of a Durer print. It seemed to place itselfthere, in the middle distance, on the sharp salience of its commingledReforms and Reservesreformers and reservists rubbing shoulders in thecommon distinctness of their detachment from an inexpressive generation,and the composition rounding itself about as with the very last of itsloose ends snipped off or tucked in.                                  IIIThere are neither loose ends nor stray flutters, whether of the oldprose or the old poetry, to be encountered on the large lower level,though there are performances of a different order, in the shadow ofwhich such matters tend to look merely, and perhaps rather meagrely,subjective. It is all very rich and prosperous and monotonous, the largelower level, but oh, so inexpressibly vacant! Where the new landcorresponds most to its name, rejoices most visibly and complacently inits newness, its dumped and shovelled foundations, the home tillrecently of a mere vague marine backwater, there the long, straightresidential avenues, vistas quite documentary, as one finds ones selfpronouncing them, testify with a perfection all their own to a wholevast side of American life. The winter winds and snows, and the eternaldust, run races in them over the clearest course anywhere provided forthat grim competition; the league-long brick pavements mirror theexpansive void, for many months of the year, in their smooth, tightice-coats (and ice over brick can only be described as heels over head),and the innumerable windows, up and down, watch each other, allhopelessly, as for revelations, indiscretions, audible, resonant,rebellious or explosive breakages of the pane from within, that neverdisturb the peace. (No one will begin, and the buried hatchet, in spiteof whatever wistful looks to where it lies, is never dug up.) So it isthat these sustained affirmations of one of the smoothest and the mostsettled social states going excite perversely, on the part of therestless analyst, questions that would seem logically the very lastinvolved. We call such aspects documentary because they strike us,more than any others, as speaking volumes for the possible _serenity_,the common decency, the quiet cohesion, of a vast commercial andprofessional bourgeoisie left to itself. Here was such an order caughtin the very fact, the fact of its living maximum. A bourgeoisie withoutan aristocracy to worry it is of course a very different thing from abourgeoisie struggling _in_ that shade, and nothing could express morethan these interminable perspectives of security the condition of acommunity leading its life in the social sun.Why, accordingly, of December afternoons, did the restless analyst,pausing at eastward-looking corners, find on his lips the vague refrainof Tennysons long, unlovely street? Why, if Harley Street, ifWimpole, is unlovely, should Marlborough Street, Boston, be sobeyondthe mere platitude of its motiveless name? Here is no monotony of blackleasehold brick, no patent disavowal, in the interest of stale andstrictly subordinate gentilities, of expression, animation, variety,curiosity; here, on the contrary, is often the individual house-front inall its independence and sometimes in all its felicity: this wholeregion being, like so many such regions in the United States to-day, thehome of the free hand, a field for the liveliest architecturalexperiment. There are interesting, admirable housesthough always toomuch of the detestable vitreous bowand there is above all what thereis everywhere in America for saving, or at least for propping up, thesituation, that particular look of the clear course and largeopportunity ahead, which, when taken in conjunction with all the will tolive, all the money to spend, all the knowledge to acquire and apply,seems to marshal the material possibilities in glittering illimitableranks. Beacon Street, moreover, used to stretch back like a workabletelescope for the focussing, at its higher extremity, in an air of whichthe positive defect is to be too seldom prejudicial, of the gilded domeof the State Housefresh as a Christmas toy seen across the floor of alarge salubrious nursery. This made a civic vignette that furnished alittle the desert of cheerful family life. But Marlborough Street, forimperturbable reasons of its own, used periodically to break my heart.It was of no use to make a vow of hanging about till I should havesounded my mysterylearned to say _why_ black, stale Harley Street, forinstance, in featureless row after row, had character and depth, whilewhat was before me fell upon my sense with the thinness of tone of aprecocious childand still more why this latter effect should have been,as it were, so insistently irritating. If there be strange ways ofproducing an interest, to the critical mind, there are doubtless stillstranger ways of not producing one, and it was important to me, nodoubt, to make my defunct and compact and expressive little Bostonappear to don all the signs of that character that the New Land, andwhat is built thereon, miss. How could one consider the place at allunless in a light?so that one had to decide definitely on ones light.This it was after all easy to do from the moment one had determined toconcede to the New Land the fact of possession of everything convenientand handsome under heaven. Peace could always come with this recognitionof all the accessories and equipments, a hundred costly things, parksand palaces and institutions, that the earlier community had lacked; andthere was an individual connectiononly one, presently to be notedinwhich the actual city might seem for an hour to have no capacity for theuplifting _idea_, no aptitude for the finer curiosity, to envy the past.But meanwhile it was strange that even so fine a conception, finelyembodied, as the new Public Library, magnificently superseding allothers, was committed to speak to ones inner perception still more ofthe power of the purse and of the higher turn for business than of theold intellectual, or even of the old moral, sensibility. Why else thenshould one have thought of some single, some admirable hour of Emerson,in one of the dusky, primitive lecture-halls that have ceased to be, orof some large insuperable anti-slavery eloquence of Wendell Phillipss,during the same term and especially during the War, as breathing more ofthe consciousness of literature and of history than all the promiscuousbustle of the Florentine palace by Copley Square? Not that this latteredifice, the fruit of immense considerations, has not its honourableinterest too; which it would have if only in the light of the constanttruth that almost any American application or practice of a generalthought puts on a new and original aspect. Public libraries are athoroughly general thought, and one has seen plenty of them, one isseeing dreadfully many, in these very days, the world over; yet to beconfronted with an American example is to have sight straightway of moredifference than community, and to glean on the spot fresh evidence ofthat democratic way of dealing which it has been the American office totranslate from an academic phrase into a bristling fact. The notes ofdifference of the Florentine palace by Copley Squaremore delicatelyelegant, in truth, if less sublimely rugged, than most Florentinepalacesresolve themselves, like so many such notes everywhere, into ourimpression here, once more, that every one is in everything, whereasin Europe so comparatively few persons are in anything (even as yet insociety, more and more the common refuge or retreat of the masses).The Boston institution then is a great and complete institution, withthis reserve of its striking the restored absentee as practicallywithout _penetralia_. A library without _penetralia_ may affect him butas a temple without altars; it will at any rate exemplify thedistinction between a benefit given and a benefit taken, a borrowed, alent, and an owned, an appropriated convenience. The British Museum, theLouvre, the Bibliothque Nationale, the treasures of South Kensington,are assuredly, under forms, at the disposal of the people; but it is tobe observed, I think, that the people walk there more or less under theshadow of the right waited for and conceded. It remains as difficult asit is always interesting, however, to trace the detail (much of itobvious enough, but much more indefinable) of the personal port of ademocracy that, unlike the English, is social as well as political. Oneof these denotements is that social democracies are unfriendly to thepreservation of _penetralia_; so that when _penetralia_ are of theessence, as in a place of study and meditation, they inevitably go tothe wall. The main staircase, in Boston, has, with its amplitude of wingand its splendour of tawny marble, a high and luxurious beautybribingthe restored absentee to emotion, moreover, by expanding, monumentally,at one of its rests, into admirable commemoration of the Civil Warservice of the two great Massachusetts Volunteer regiments of _lite_.Such visions, such felicities, such couchant lions and recorded namesand stirred memories as these, encountered in the early autumn twilight,_colour_ an impressioneven though to say so be the limit of breach ofthe silence in which, for persons of the generation of the author ofthese pages, appreciation of them can best take refuge: the refuge towhich I felt myself anon reduced, for instance, opposite the StateHouse, in presence of Saint-Gaudenss noble and exquisite monument toRobert Gould Shaw and the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. There are works ofmemorial art that may suddenly place themselves, by their operation in agiven case, outside articulate criticismwhich was what happened, Ifound, in respect to the main feature, the rich staircase of theLibrary. Another way in which the bribe, as I have called it, of thatmasterpiece worked on the spot was by prompting one to immediate charmedperception of the character of the deep court and inner arcade of thepalace, where a wealth of science and taste has gone to producing asense, when the afternoon light sadly slants, of one of the myriadgold-coloured courts of the Vatican.These are the refinements of the present Bostonkeeping company as theycan with the healthy animation, as it struck me, of the rest of thebuilding, the multitudinous bustle, the coming and going, as in arailway-station, of persons with carpet-bags and other luggage, thesimplicity of plan, the open doors and immediate accesses, admirable_for_ a railway-station, the ubiquitous children, _most_ irrepressiblelittle democrats of the democracy, the vain quest, above all, of thedeeper depths aforesaid, some part that should be sufficiently _within_some other part, sufficiently withdrawn and consecrated, not toconstitute a thoroughfare. Perhaps I didnt adequately explore; butthere was always the visible scale and scheme of the building. It was ashock to find the so brave decorative designs of Puvis de Chavannes, ofSargent and Abbey and John Elliott, hanging over mere chambers offamiliarity and resonance; and then, I must quickly add, it was a shockstill greater perhaps to find one had no good reason for defending themagainst such freedoms. What was sauce for the goose was sauce for thegander: had one not in other words, in the public places and under thegreat loggias of Italy, acclaimed it as just the charm and dignity ofthese resorts that, in their pictured and embroidered state, they stillserve for the graceful common life? It was true that one had not beenimprisoned in that consistency in the Laurentian, in the AmbrosianLibraryand at any rate one was here on the edge of abysses. Was it notsplendid, for example, to see, in Boston, such large provision made forthe amusement of children on rainy afternoons?so many little heads bentover their story-books that the edifice took on at moments theappearance worn, one was to observe later on, by most other Americanedifices of the same character, that of a lively distributing-house ofthe new fiction for the young. The note was bewilderingyet would one,snatching the bread-and-molasses from their lips, cruelly deprive theyoung of rights in which they have been installed with a majesty nowhereelse approaching that of their American installation? I am not wrong,probably, at all events, in qualifying such a question as that asabysmal, and I remember how, more than once, I took refuge from it incraven flight, straight across the Square, to the already sointeresting, the so rapidly-expanding Art Museum.There, for some reason, questions exquisitely dropped; perhaps only forthe reason that things sifted and selected have, very visibly, theeffect of challenging the confidence even of the rash. It is of thenature of objects doomed to show distinction that they virtually make adesert round them, and peace reigned unbroken, I usually noted, in thetwo or three Museum rooms that harbour a small but deeply-interestingand steadily-growing collection of fragments of the antique. Here therestless analyst found work to his handonly too much; and indeed inpresence of the gem of the series, of the perhaps just too consciousgrace of a certain little wasted and dim-eyed head of Aphrodite, he feltthat his function should simply give way, in common decency, to that ofthe sonneteer. For it is an impression by itself, and I think quiteworth the Atlantic voyage, to catch in the American light the very factof the genius of Greece. There are things we dont know, feelings not tobe foretold, till we have had that experiencewhich I commend to the_raffin_ of almost any other clime. I should say to him that he has not_seen_ a fine Greek thing till he has seen it in America. It is ofcourse on the face of it the most merciless case of transplantingthemere moral of which, none the less, for application, becomes by no meansflagrant. The little Aphrodite, with her connections, her antecedentsand references exhibiting the maximum of breakage, is no doubt as_lonely_ a jewel as ever strayed out of its setting; yet what does onequickly recognize but that the intrinsic lustre will have, so far asthat may be possible, doubled? She has lost her background, the divinecreaturehas lost her company, and is keeping, in a manner, thestrangest; but so far from having lost an iota of her power, she hasgained unspeakably more, since what she essentially stands for she herestands for alone, rising ineffably to the occasion. She has in short, byher single presence, as yet, annexed an empire, and there are strangeglimmers of moments when, as I have spoken of her consciousness, thevery knowledge of this seems to lurk in the depth of her beauty. Wherewas she ever more, where was she ever so much, a goddessand who knowsbut that, being thus divine, she foresees the time when, as she hasmoved over, the place of her actual whereabouts will have become oneof her shrines? Objects doomed to distinction make round them a desert,I have said; but that is only for any gross confidence in other matters.For confidence in _them_ they make a garden, and that is why I felt thisquarter of the Boston Art Museum bloom, under the indescribable dimeyes, with delicate flowers. The impression swallowed up every other;the place, whatever it was, was supremely justified, and I was left coldby learning that a much bigger and grander and richer place is presentlyto overtop it.The present establishment dates back, back almost to the good Bostonof the middle years, and is full of all sorts of accumulated andconcentrated pleasantness; which fact precisely gives the signal, by theterrible American law, for its coming to an end and giving a chance tothe untried. It is a consistent application of the rotary systemtheuntried always awaiting its turn, and quite perceptibly stamping andsnorting while it waits; all heedless as it is, poor innocent untried,of the certain hour of the impatiences before which it too will have toretreat. It is not indeed that the American laws, so operating, have notalmost always their own queer interest; founded as they are, alltogether, on one of the strongest of the native impulses. We see thischaracteristic again and again at play, see it in especial wherever wesee (which is more than frequently enough) a university or a collegestarted or amplified. This process almost always takes the form,primarily, of more lands and houses and halls and rooms, moreswimming-baths and football-fields and gymnasia, a greater luxury ofbrick and mortar, a greater ingenuity, the most artful conceivable, ofaccommodation and installation. Such is the magic, such the presences,that tend, more than any other, to figure _as_ the Institution, therebyperverting not a little, as need scarce be remarked, the finercollegiate idea: the theory being, doubtless, and again mostcharacteristically, that with all the wrought stone and oak and paintedglass, the immense provision, the multiplied marbles and tiles andcloisters and acres, people will come, that is, individuals of valuewill, and in some manner work some miracle. In the early American time,doubtless, individuals of value had to wait too much for things; butthat is now made up by the way things are waiting for individuals ofvalue. To which I must immediately add, howeverand it is the ground ofmy allusion of a moment agothat no impression of the new Boston canfeel itself hang together without remembrance of what it owes to thatrare exhibition of the living spirit lately achieved, in the interest ofthe fine arts, and of all that is noblest in them, by the unaided andquite heroic genius of a private citizen. To attempt to tell the storyof the wonderfully-gathered and splendidly-lodged Gardner Collectionwould be to displace a little the line that separates private frompublic property; and yet to find no discreet word for it is to appear tofail of feeling for the complexity of conditions amid which so undaunteda devotion to a great idea (undaunted by the battle to fight, losing,alas, with State Protection of native art, and with other scarce lessuncanny things) has been able consummately to flower. It is in presenceof the results magnificently attained, the energy triumphant overeverything, that one feels the fine old disinterested tradition ofBoston least broken.                                  VIII                           CONCORD AND SALEM                                   II felt myself, on the spot, cast about a little for the right expressionof it, and then lost any hesitation to say that, putting the three orfour biggest cities aside, Concord, Massachusetts, had an identity morepalpable to the mind, had nestled in other words more successfullybeneath her narrow fold of the mantle of history, than any otherAmerican town. Compare me with places of my size, you know, one seemedto hear her plead, with the modesty that, under the mild autumn sun, sowell became her russet beauty; and this exactly it was that prompted theemphasis of ones reply, or, as it may even be called, of onesdeclaration.Ah, my dear, it isnt a question of places of your size, since amongplaces of your size youre too obviously and easily first: its aquestion of places, so many of them, of fifty times your size, and whichyet dont begin to have a fraction of your weight, or your character, oryour intensity of presence and sweetness of tone, or your moral charm,or your pleasant appreciability, or, in short, of anything that isyours. Your size? Why, youre the biggest little place in Americawithonly New York and Boston and Chicago, by what I make out, to surpassyou; and the country is lucky indeed to have you, in your sole andsingle felicity, for if it hadnt, where in the world should we go,inane and unappeased, for the particular communication of which you havethe secret? The country is colossal, and you but a microscopic speck onthe hem of its garment; yet theres nothing else like you, take you allround, for we _see_ you complacently, with the naked eye, whereas-thereare vast sprawling, bristling areas, great grey centres of populationthat spread, on the map, like irremediable grease-spots, which failutterly of any appeal to our vision or any control of it, leaving it topass them by as if they were not. If you are so thoroughly the oppositeof one of these I dont say its all your superlative merit; itsrather, as I have put it, your felicity, your good fortune, the resultof the half-dozen happy turns of the wheel in your favour. Half-a-dozensuch turns, you see, are, for any mortal career, a handsome allowance;and your merit is that, recognizing this, you have not fallen below yourestate. But its your fortune, above all, thats your charm. One doesntwant to be patronizing, but you didnt, thank goodness, make yours.Thats what the other places, the big ones that are as nothing to you,are trying to do, the country overto make theirs; and, from the pointof view of these remarks, all in vain. Your luck is that you didnt haveto; yours had been, just as it shows in you to-day, made _for_ you, andyou at the most but gratefully submitted to it. It must be said for you,however, that you keep it; and it isnt every place that would have beencapable! You keep the look, you keep the feeling, you keep the air.Your great trees arch over these possessions more protectingly, coveringthem in as a cherished presence; and you have settled to your tone andyour type as to treasures that can now never be taken. Show me the otherplaces in America (of the few that have _had_ anything) from which thebest hasnt mainly been taken, or isnt in imminent danger of being.There is old Salem, there is old Newport, which I am on my way to seeagain, and which, if you will, are, by what I hear, still comparativelyintact; but their having was never a having like yours, and they adorn,precisely, my little tale of your supremacy. No, I dont want to bepatronizing, but your only fault is your tendency to improveI mean justby your duration as you _are_; which indeed is the only sort ofimprovement that is not questionable.Such was the drift of the warm flood of appreciation, of reflection,that Concord revisited could set rolling over the field of a preparedsensibility; and I feel as if I had quite made my point, such as it is,in asking what other American village could have done anything of thesort. I should have been at fault perhaps only in speaking of theinterest in question as visible, on that large scale, to the nakedeye; the truth being perhaps that one wouldnt have been so methalf-way by ones impression unless one had rather particularly _known_,and that knowledge, in such a case, amounts to a pair of magnifyingspectacles. I remember indeed putting it to myself on the NovemberSunday morning, tepid and bright and perfect for its use, through whichI walked from the station under the constant archway of the elms, as yetbut indulgently thinned: would one know, for ones self, what hadformerly been the matter here, if one hadnt happened to be able to getround behind, in the past, as it were, and more or less understand?Would the operative elements of the pastlittle old Concord Fight,essentially, and Emerson and Hawthorne and Thoreau, with the rest of thehistoric animation and the rest of the figured and shiftingtranscendental company, to its last and loosest ramificationswouldeven these handsome quantities have so lingered to ones intelligentafter-sense, if one had not brought with one some sign by which they toowould know; dim, shy spectralities as, for themselves, they must, at thebest, have become? Idle, however, such questions when, by the chance ofthe admirable day, everything, in its own way and order, unmistakablycame _out_every string sounded as if, for all the world, the loose NewEngland town (and I apply the expression but to the relations of objectsand places), were a lyre swept by the hand of Apollo. Apollo was thespirit of antique piety, looking about, pausing, remembering, as hemoved to his music; and there were glimpses and reminders that of coursekept him much longer than others.Seated there at its ease, as if placidly familiar with pilgrims andquite taking their homage for granted, the place had the very aspect ofsome grave, refined New England matron of the old school, the widow ofa high celebrity, living on and on in possession of all his relics andproperties, and, though not personally addicted to gossip or tojournalism, having become, where the great company kept by her in thepast is concerned, quite cheerful and modern and responsive. From herposition, her high-backed chair by the window that commands most of thecoming and going, she looks up intelligently, over her knitting, with novision of any limit on her part as yet, to this attitude, and withnothing indeed to suggest the possibility of a limit save a hint of thatloss of temporal perspective in which we recognize the mental effect ofa great weight of years. I had formerly the acquaintance of a veryinteresting lady, of extreme age, whose early friends, in literarycircles, are now regarded as classics, and who, toward the end of herlife, always said, You know Charles Lamb has produced a play at DruryLane, or You know William Hazlitt has fallen in love with such a veryodd woman. Her facts were perfectly correct; only death had beautifullypassed out of her worldsince I dont remember her mentioning to me thedemise, which she might have made so contemporary, either of Byron or ofScott. When people were ill she admirably forbore to ask about themshedisapproved wholly of such conditions; and there were interestinginvalids round about her, near to her, whose existence she for longyears consummately ignored. It is some such quiet backward stride asthose of my friend that I seem to hear the voice of old Concord take inreference to her annals, and it is not too much to say that where hersoil is most sacred, I fairly caught, on the breeze, the mitigatedperfect tense. You know there has been a fight between our men and theKingsone wouldnt have been surprised, that crystalline Sunday noon,where so little had changed, where the stream and the bridge, and allnature, and the _feeling_, above all, still so directly testify, at anyfresh-sounding form of such an announcement.I had forgotten, in all the years, with what thrilling clearness thatsupreme site speaksthough anciently, while so much of the course of thecentury was still to run, the distinctness might have seemed evengreater. But to stand there again was to take home this foreshortenedview, the gained nearness, to ones sensibility; to look straight overthe heads of the American Weimar company at the inestimable hour thathad so handsomely set up for them their background. The Fight had beenthe hingeso one saw iton which the large revolving future was to turn;or it had been better, perhaps, the large firm nail, ringingly drivenin, from which the beautiful portrait-group, as we see it to-day, was tohang. Beautiful exceedingly the local Emerson and Thoreau and Hawthorneand (in a fainter way) _tutti quanti_; but beautiful largely because thefine old incident down in the valley had so seriously prepared theireffect. That seriousness gave once for all the pitch, and it was verilyas if, under such a value, even with the seed of a literary circle sofreely scattered by an intervening hand, the vulgar note would in thatair never be possible. As I had inevitably, in long absence, let thevalue, for immediate perception, rather waste itself, so, on the spot,it came back most instantly with the extraordinary sweetness of theriver, which, under the autumn sun, like all the American rivers one hadseen or was to see, straightway took the whole case straightway into itshands. Oh, you shall tell me of your impression when you have felt what_I_ can do for it: so hang over me well!thats what they all seem tosay.I hung over Concord River then as long as I could, and recalled howThoreau, Hawthorne, Emerson himself, have expressed with due sympathythe sense of this full, slow, sleepy, meadowy flood, which sets its paceand takes its twists like some large obese benevolent person, scarce sofrankly unsociable as to pass you at all. It had watched the Fight, iteven now confesses, without a quickening of its current, and it drawsalong the woods and the orchards and the fields with the purr of a milddomesticated cat who rubs against the family and the furniture. Not tobe recorded, at best, however, I think, never to emerge from the stateof the inexpressible, in respect to the spot, by the bridge, where onemost lingers, is the sharpest suggestion of the whole scenethe powerdiffused in it which makes it, after all these years, or perhaps indeedby reason of their number, so irresistibly touching. All thecommemorative objects, the stone marking the burial-place of the threeEnglish soldiers, the animated image of the young belted American yeomanby Mr. Daniel French, the intimately associated element in the presence,not far off, of the old manse, interesting theme of Hawthornes pen,speak to the spirit, no doubt, in one of the subtlest tones of whichofficial history is capable, and yet somehow leave the exquisitemelancholy of everything unuttered. It lies too deep, as it always solies where the ground has borne the weight of the short, simple act,intense and unconscious, that was to determine the event, determine thefuture in the way we call immortally. For we read into the scene toolittle of what we may, unless this muffled touch in it somehow reachesus so that we feel the pity and the irony of the _precluded_ relation onthe part of the fallen defenders. The sense that was theirs and thatmoved them we know, but we seem to know better still the sense thatwasnt and that couldnt, and that forms our luxurious heritage as oureyes, across the gulf, seek to meet their eyes; so that we are almostashamed of taking so much, such colossal quantity and value, as theequivalent of their dimly-seeing offer. The huge bargain they made forus, in a word, made by the gift of the little all they hadto themodesty of which amount the homely rural facts grouped there togetherhave appeared to go on testifyingthis brilliant advantage strikes theimagination that yearns over them as unfairly enjoyed at their cost. Wasit delicate, was it decentthat is _would_ it have beento ask theembattled farmers, simple-minded, unwitting folk, to make us soinordinate a present with so little of the conscious credit of it? Whichall comes indeed, perhaps, simply to the most poignant of all thoseeffects of disinterested sacrifice that the toil and trouble of ourforefathers produce for us. The minute-men at the bridge were of courseinterested intensely, as they believedbut such, too, was the artfulmanner in which we see _our_ latent, lurking, waiting interest like, aJew in a dusky back-shop, providentially bait the trap.Beyond even such broodings as these, and to another purpose, moreover,the communicated spell falls, in its degree, into that pathetic oddityof the small aspect, and the rude and the lowly, the reduced andhumiliated above all, that sits on so many nooks and corners, objectsand appurtenances, old contemporary thingscontemporary with the doingsof our race; simplifying our antecedents, our annals, to within an inchof their life, making us ask, in presence of the rude relics even ofgreatness, mean retreats and receptacles, constructionally so poor, fromwhat barbarians or from what pigmies we have sprung. There are certainrough black mementos of the early monarchy, in England and Scotland,there are glimpses of the original humble homes of other greatness aswell, that strike in perfection this grim little note; which has theinterest of our being free to take it, for curiosity, for luxury ofthought, as that of the real or that of the romantic, and with which,again, the deep Concord rusticity, momentary medium of our nationaldrama, essentially consorts. We remember the small hard facts of theShakespeare house at Stratford; we remember the rude closet, inEdinburgh Castle, in which James VI of Scotland was born, or the otherlittle black hole, at Holyrood, in which Mary Stuart sat and in whichRizzio was murdered. These, I confess, are odd memories at Concord;although the manse, near the spot where we last paused, and against theedge of whose acre or two the loitering river seeks friction in themanner I have mentioned, would now seem to have shaken itself a trifledisconcertingly free of the ornamental mosses scattered by Hawthorneslight hand; it stands there, beyond its gate, with every due similitudeto the shrunken historic site in general. To which I must hasten to add,however, that I was much more struck with the way these particularplaces of visitation resist their pressure of reference than with theiraffecting us as below their fortune. Intrinsically they are asnaughtdeeply depressing, in fact, to any impulse to reconstitute, thehouse in which Hawthorne spent what remained to him of life after hisreturn from the Italy of his Donatello and his Miriam. Yet, in commonwith everything else, this mild monument benefits by that something inthe air which makes us tender, keeps us respectful; meets, in thegeneral interest, waving it vaguely away, any closer assault ofcriticism.It is odd, and it is also exquisite, that these witnessing ways shouldbe the last ground on which we feel moved to ponderation of the Concordschoolto use, I admit, a futile expression; or rather, I shoulddoubtless say, it _would_ be odd if there were not inevitably somethingabsolute in the fact of Emersons all but lifelong connection with them.We may smile a little as we drag in Weimar, but I confess myself, formy part, much more satisfied than not by our happy equivalent, inAmerican money, for Goethe and Schiller. The money is a potful in thesecond case as in the first, and if Goethe, in the one, represents thegold and Schiller the silver, I find (and quite putting aside anybimetallic prejudice) the same good relation in the other betweenEmerson and Thoreau. I open Emerson for the same benefit for which Iopen Goethe, the sense of moving in large intellectual space, and thatof the gush, here and there, out of the rock, of the crystalline cupful,in wisdom and poetry, in Wahrheit and Dichtung; and whatever I openThoreau for (I neednt take space here for the good reasons) I open himoftener than I open Schiller. Which comes back to our feeling that therarity of Emersons genius, which has made him so, for the attentivepeoples, the first, and the one really rare, American spirit in letters,couldnt have spent his career in a charming woody, watery place, for solong socially and typically and, above all, interestingly homogeneous,without an effect as of the communication to it of somethingineffaceable. It was during his long span his immediate concrete,sufficient world; it gave him his nearest vision of life, and he drewhalf his images, we recognize, from the revolution of its seasons andthe play of its manners. I dont speak of the other half, which he drewfrom elsewhere. It is admirably, to-day, as if we were still seeingthese things _in_ those images, which stir the air like birds, dim inthe eventide, coming home to nest. If one had reached a time of lifeone had thereby at least heard him lecture; and not a russet leaf fellfor me, while I was there, but fell with an Emersonian drop.                                   IIIt never failed that if in moving about I made, under stress, aninquiry, I should prove to have made it of a flagrant foreigner. Itnever happened that, addressing a fellow-citizen, in the street, on oneof those hazards of possible communion with the indigenous spirit, Ishould not draw a blank. So, inevitably, at Salem, when, wanderingperhaps astray, I asked my way to the House of the Seven Gables, theyoung man I had overtaken was true to his nature; he stared at me as aremorseless Italianas remorseless, at least, as six months of Salemcould leave him. On that spot, in that air, I confess, it was aparticular shock to me to be once more, with my so good generalintention, so put off; though, if my young man but glared frankignorance of the monument I named, he left me at least with the interestof wondering how the native estimate of it as a romantic ruin mightstrike a taste formed for such features by the landscape of Italy. Iwill not profess that by the vibration of this note the edifice of myfond fancyI mean Hawthornes Salem, and the witches, and that of othereminent historic figureswas not rather essentially shaken; since whathad the intention of my pilgrimage been, in all good faith, in artlesssympathy and piety, but a search again, precisely, for the New Englandhomogeneousfor the renewal of that impression of it which had lingeredwith me from a vision snatched too briefly, in a midsummer gloaming,long years ago. I had been staying near, at that far-away time, and, therailroad helping, had got myself dropped there for an hour at just theright moment of the waning day. This memory had been, from far back, akept felicity altogether; a picture of goodly Colonial habitations,quite the high-water mark of that type of state and ancientry, seen inthe clear dusk, and of almost nothing else but a pleasant harbour-sidevacancy, the sense of dead marine industries, that finally looked out atme, for a climax, over a grass-grown interval, from the blank windows ofthe old Customs House of the Introduction to _The Scarlet Letter_.I could on that occasion have seen, with my eye on my return-train,nothing else; but the image of these things I had not lost, wrapped upas it even was, for the fancy, in some figment of the very patch of oldembroidered cloth that Hawthornes charming prefatory pages unfold foruspages in which the words are as finely taken as the silk and goldstitches of poor Hester Prynnes compunctious needle. It had hung, allthe years, closely together, and had servedoh, so conveniently!as theterm of comparison, the rather rich frame, for any suggested vision ofNew England life unalloyed. The case now was the more marked that,already, on emerging from the station and not knowing quite where tolook again for my goodly Georgian and neo-Georgian houses, I had had topermit myself to be directed to them by a civil Englishman, accosted bythe way, who, all kindness and sympathy, immediately mentioned that theyformed the Grosvenor Square, as might be said, of Salem. We conversedfor the moment, and settled, as he told me, in the town, he was mostsustaining; but when, a little later on, I stood there in admiration ofthe noble quarter, I could only feel, even while doing it every justice,that the place was not quite what my imagination had counted on. It waspossibly even better, for the famous houses, almost without exceptionample and charming, seemed to me to show a grace even beyond myrecollection; the only thing was that I had never bargained for lookingat them through a polyglot air. Look at them none the less, and at thefine old liberal scale, and felt symmetry, and simple dignity, and solidsincerity of them, I gratefully did, with due speculation as to theiractual chances and changes, as to what they represent to-day as socialvalues, and with a lively impression, above all, of their preservedand unsophisticated state. That was a social valuewhich I found myselfcomparing, for instance, with similar aspects, frequent and excellent,in old English towns.The Salem houses, the best, were all of the old English family, and,from picture to picture, all the parts would have matched; but themoral, the social, the political climate, even more than the breath ofnature, had had in each case a different action, had begotten on eitherside a different consciousness. Or was it nearer even to say that thesethings had on one side begotten a consciousness, and had on the otherbegotten comparatively none? The approximation would have been the moreinteresting as each arrayed group might pass for a supreme expression ofrespectability. It would be the tone and weight, the quantity andquality, of the respectability that make the difference; massive andsquare-shouldered, yet rather battered and mottled, chipped and frayed,at last rather sceptical and cynical, in fine, in the Englishfigurethin and clear, consistently sharp, boldly unspotted, blanklyserene, in the American. It was more amusing at any rate to spin suchfancies, in reaction from the alien snub, than simply to see onesantitheses reduced to a mere question of the effect of climate. Therewould be yet more to say for the Salem picture, many of the bits ofwhich remain, as Ruskin might have put it, entirely delightful; buttheir desperate clean freshness was what was more to abide with me afterthe polyglot air had cleared a little. The spacious, courteous doorwaysof the houses, expansively columned, fluted, framed; their large honestwindows, in ample tiers, only here and there dishonoured by the modernpane; their high bland foreheads, in short, with no musty secrets in theeavesyes, not one, in spite of the speciality, in this respect, ofthe Seven Gables, to which I am comingclarify too much perhaps theexpressive mask, the look of experience, depress the balance toward thetype of the expensive toy, shown on its shelf, but too good to behumanly used. Its as if the old witches had been suffered to liveagain, penally, as public housemaids, using nocturnally, for purposes ofalmost viciously-thorough purification, the famous broomsticks they usedwantonly to ride.Was it a sacred terror, after this, that stayed me from crossing thethreshold of the Witch House?in spite of the quite definite sturdystamp of this attraction. I think it was an almost sacred tendernessrather, the instinct of not pressing too hard on my privilege and of notdraining the offered cup to the lees. It is always interesting, inAmerica, to see any object, some builded thing in particular, look asold as it possibly can; for the sight of which effort we sometimes holdour breath as if to watch, over the course of the backward years, thestraight track of the past, the course of some hero of the foot-raceon whom we have staked our hopes. How long will he hold out, how farback will he run, and where, heroically blown, will he have to drop? Oursuspense is great in proportion to our hope, and if we are nervouslyconstituted we may very well, at the last, turn away for anxiety. It wasreally in some such manner I was affected, I think, before the SalemWitch House, in presence of the mystery of antiquity. It is a modestwooden structure, consciously primitive, standing, if I rememberrightly, in some effective relation to a street-corner and putting nolittle purpose into its archaism. The pity is, however, that unrelievedwooden houses never very curiously testifyas I was presently to learn,to my cost, from the dreadful anti-climax of the Seven Gables. They lookbrief and provisional at the bestlook, above all, incorrigibly andwitlessly innocent. The quite sufficiently sturdy little timbered massby the Salem street, none the less, with a sidelong crook or twist thatwe may take as symbolizing ancient perversity, runs the backward race aslong-windedly as we may anywhere, over the land, see it run. Had I gonein, as a frank placard invited me, I might have better measured theexploit; yet, on the other hand, fearing frank placards, in general, inthese cases, fearing nothing so much as reconstituted antiquity, I mighthave lost a part of my good little impressionwhich otherwise, as asmall pale flower plucked from a withered tree, I could fold away,intact, between the leaves of my romantic herbarium.I wanted, moreover, to be honest, not to fail, within the hour, of twoother urgent matters, my train away (my sense of Salem was too destinedto be train-haunted) and a due visitation of the Seven Gables and of thebirth-house of their chronicler. It was in the course of this errandthat I was made to feel myself, as I have mentioned, living, ratherwitlessly, in a world unknown to the active Salemite of to-daya worldembodied, I seemed to make out, in the large untidy industrial quarterthat had sprung up since my early visit. Did I quite escape from thisimpression before alighting at last happily upon the small stalestructure that had sheltered the romancers entrance into life and thatnow appears, according to the preference of fancy, either a strangerecipient of the romantic germ or the very spot to cause it, in protestand desperation, to develop? I took the neighbourhood, at all events,for the small original Hawthornesque world, keeping the other, the smokymodernism, at a distance, keeping everything, in fact, at a distanceonso spare and bare and lean and mean a face did the bright hard skystrike me as looking down. The way to think of it evidently was in somefrank rural light of the past, that of all the ancient New Englandsimplicities, with the lap of wide waters and the stillness of rockypastures never far off (they seem still indeed close at hand), and withany number of our present worryings and pamperings of the literarytemperament too little in question to be missed. It kept at a distance,in fact, so far as my perception was concerned, everything but a littleboy, a dear little harsh, intelligent, sympathetic American boy, whodropped straight from the hard sky for my benefit (I hadnt seen himemerge from elsewhere) and turned up at my side with absolute confidenceand with the most knowing tips. He might have been a Weimar tout or aStratford amateuronly he so beautifully wasnt. That is what I mean bymy having alighted happily; the little boy was so completely master ofhis subject, and we formed, on the spot, so close an alliance. He madeup to me for my crude Italianthe way they _become_ crude over here!hemade up to me a little even for my civil Englishman; he was exactly whatI wanteda presence (and he was the only thing far or near) old enough,native and intimate enough, to reach back and to understand.He showed me the window of the room in which Hawthorne had been born;wild horses, as the phrase is, wouldnt have dragged me into it, but_he_ might have done so if he hadnt, as I say, understood. But heunderstood everything, and knew when to insist and when not to; knew,for instance, exactly why I said Dear, dear, are you very sure? afterhe had brought me to sight of an object at the end of a lane, by a vaguewaterside, I think, and looking across to Marblehead, that he invited meto take, if I could, for the Seven Gables. I couldnt take it in theleast, as happens, and though he was perfectly sure, our reasons, oneither side, were equally clear to himso that in short I think of himas the very genius of the place, feeding his small shrillness on thecold scraps of Hawthornes leaving and with the making of hisacquaintance alone worth the journey. Yet the fact that, the SevenGables being in question, the shapeless object by the waterside wouldntdo at all, not the least little bit, troubled us only till we had thrownoff together, with a quick, competent gesture and at the breaking oflight, the poor illusion of a _necessity_ of relation between theaccomplished thing, for poetry, for art, and those other quite equivocalthings that we inflate our ignorance with seeing it suggested by. Theweak, vague domiciliary presence at the end of the lane may have been(in our poor parlance) the idea of the admirable bookthough even herewe take a leap into dense darkness; but the idea that is the inner forceof the admirable book so vividly forgets, before our eyes, any suchorigin or reference, cutting it dead as a low acquaintance andoutsoaring the shadow of its night, that the connection has turned asomersault into space, repudiated like a ladder kicked back from the topof a wall. Hawthornes ladder at Salem, in fine, has now quite gone, andwe but tread the air if we attempt to set our critical feet on its stepsand its rounds, learning thus as we do, and with infinite interest as Ithink, how merely subjective in us are our discoveries about genius.Endless are its ways of besetting and eluding, of meeting and mockingus. When there are appearances that might have nourished it we see it asswallowing them all; yet we see it as equally gorged when there are noappearances at all_then_ most of all, sometimes, quite insolentlybloated; and we recognize ruefully that we are forever condemned to knowit only after the fact.                                   IX                              PHILADELPHIA                                   ITo be at all critically, or as we have been fond of calling it,analytically, mindedover and beyond an inherent love of the generalmany-coloured picture of thingsis to be subject to the superstitionthat objects and places, coherently grouped, disposed for human use andaddressed to it, must have a sense of their own, a mystic meaning properto themselves to give out: to give out, that is, to the participant atonce so interested and so detached as to be moved to a report of thematter. That perverse person is obliged to take it for a working theorythat the essence of almost any settled aspect of anything may beextracted by the chemistry of criticism, and may give us its right name,its formula, for convenient use. From the moment the critic findshimself sighing, to save trouble in a difficult case, that the clusterof appearances can _have_ no sense, from that moment he begins, andquite consciously, to go to pieces; it being the prime business and thehigh honour of the painter of life always to _make_ a senseand to makeit most in proportion as the immediate aspects are loose or confused.The last thing decently permitted him is to recognize incoherencetorecognize it, that is, as baffling; though of course he may present andportray it, in all richness, _for_ incoherence. That, I think, was whatI had been mainly occupied with in New York; and I quitted so qualifieda joy, under extreme stress of winter, with a certain confidence that Ishould not have moved even a little of the way southward withoutpractical relief: relief which came in fact ever so promptly, atPhiladelphia, on my feeling, unmistakably, the change of half thefurniture of consciousness. This change put on, immediately, thefriendliest, the handsomest aspectsupplied my intelligence on the spotwith the clear, the salient note. I mean by this, not that the happydefinition or synthesis instantly camecame with the perception thatcharacter and sense were there, only waiting to be disengaged; but thatthe note, as I say, was already, within an hour, the germ of thesethings, and that the whole flower, assuredly, wouldnt fail to bloom. Iwas in fact sniffing up its fragrance after I had looked out for threeminutes from one of the windows of a particularly wide-fronted house andseen the large residential square that lay before me shine in its nativelight. This light, remarkably tender, I thought, for that of a winterafternoon, matched with none other I had ever seen, and announcedstraight off fifty new circumstancesan enormous number, in America, forany prospect to promise you in contradistinction from any other. It wasnot simply that, beyond a doubt, the outlook was more _mridional_; astill deeper impression had begun to work, and, as I felt it more andmore glimmer upon me, I caught myself about to jump, with a single leap,to my synthesis. I of course stayed myself in the act, for there wouldbe too much, really, yet to come; but the perception left me, I eventhen felt, in possession of half the ground on which later experiencewould proceed. It was not too much to say, as I afterwards saw, that Ihad in those few illumined moments put the gist of the matter into mypocket.Philadelphia, incontestably then, was the American city of the largetype, that didnt _bristle_just as I was afterwards to recognize in St.Louis the nearest approach to companionship with her in this respect;and to recognize in Chicago, I may parenthetically add, the mostcomplete divergence. It was not only, moreover, at the ample, tranquilwindow there, that Philadelphia _didnt_ bristle (by the record of mymoment) but that she essentially couldnt and wouldnt ever; that nomovement or process could be thought of, in fine, as more foreign to hergenius. I do not just now go into the question of what the business ofbristling, in an American city, may be estimated as consisting of; soinfallibly is one aware when the thousand possible quills _are_ erect,and when, haply, they are notsuch a test does the restored absenteefind, at least, in his pricked sensibility. A place may abound in itsown sense, as the phrase is, without bristling in the leastit is liableindeed to bristle most, I think, when not too securely possessed of anysettled sense to abound in. An imperfect grasp of such a luxury is notthe weakness of Philadelphiajust as that admirable comprehensiveflatness in her which precludes the image of the porcupine figured to mefrom the first, precisely, as her positive source of strength. Theabsence of the note of the perpetual perpendicular, the New York, theChicago noteand I allude here to the material, the constructionalexhibition of itseemed to symbolize exactly the principle of indefinitelevel extension and to offer refreshingly, a challenge to horizontal, tolateral, to more or less tangental, to rotary, or, better still, toabsolute centrifugal motion. If it was to befall me, during my brief butvarious acquaintance with the place, not to find myself more than two orthree times hoisted or lowered by machinery, my prime illumination hadbeen an absolute forecast of that immunitya virtue of generalpremonition in it at which I have already glanced. I should in fact, Irepeat, most truly or most artfully repaint my little picture by mixingmy colours with the felt amenity of that small crisis, and by showinghow this, that and the other impression to come had had, while itlasted, quite the definite prefigurement that the chapters of a bookfind in its table of contents. The afternoon blandness, for a fugitivefrom Madison Avenue in January snow, didnt mean nothing; the littlemarble steps and lintels and cornices and copings, all the so clear, soplaced accents in the good prose text of the mildly purple houses acrossthe Square, which seemed to wear them, as all the others did, up anddown the streets, in the manner of nice white stockings, neckties,collars, cuffs, didnt mean nothing; and this was somehow an assurancethat joined on to the vibration of the view produced, a few hoursbefore, by so merely convenient a circumstance as my taking my place, atJersey City, in the Pennsylvania train.I had occasion, repeatedly, to find the Pennsylvania Railroad abeguiling and predisposing influencein relation to various objectives;and indeed I quite lost myself in the singularity of this effect, whichexisted for me, certainly, only in that connection, touching me with astrange and most agreeable sense that the great line in question, aninstitution with a style and _allure_ of its own, is not, even the worldover, as other railroads are. It absolutely, with a littlefrequentation, affected me as better and higher than its office orfunction, and almost as supplying one with a mode of life intrinsicallysuperior; as if it ought really to be on its way to much grander andmore charming places than any that happen to mark its courseas ifindeed, should one persistently keep ones seat, not getting outanywhere, it would in the end carry one to some such ideal city. Onemight under this extravagant spell, which always began to work for me atTwenty-third Street, and on the constantly-adorable Ferry, have fanciedthe train, disvulgarized of passengers, steaming away, in disinterestedempty form, to some terminus too noble to be marked in _our_ poorschedules. The consciousness of this devotion would have been thus likethat of living, all sublimely, up in a balloon. It was not, howeverIrecover myselfthat if I had been put off at Philadelphia I was not, forthe hour, contented; finding so immediately, as I have noted, moreinterest to my hand than I knew at first what to do with. There was thequick light of explanation, following on everything else I havementionedthe light in which I had only to turn round again and seewhere I was, and how it was, in order to feel everything come outunder the large friendliness, the ordered charm and perfect peace of theClub, housing me with that _whole_ protection the bestowal of which onoccasion is the finest grace of the hospitality of American clubs.Philadelphia, manifestly, was beyond any other American city, a_society_, and was going to show as such, as a thoroughly confirmed andsettled onewhich fact became the key, precisely, to its extension onone plane, and to its having no pretext for bristling. Human groups thatdiscriminate in their own favour do, one remembers, in general, bristle;but that is only when they have not been really successful, when theyhave not been able to discriminate enough, when they are not, likePhiladelphia, settled and confirmed and content. It would clearly beimpossible not to regard the place before me as possessed of this secretof serenity to a degree elsewhereat least among ourselvesunrivalled.The basis of the advantage, the terms of the secret, would be still tomake outwhich was precisely the high interest; and I was afterwards tobe justified of my conviction by the multiplication of my lights.New York, in that sense, had appeared to me then not a society at all,and it was rudimentary that Chicago would be one still less; neither ofthem, as a human group, having been able to discriminate in its ownfavour with anything like such success. The proof of that would be,obviously, in ones so easily imputing to them alteration, extension,development; a change somehow unimaginable in the case of Philadelphia,which was a fixed quantity and had filled to the brim, one feltandwasnt that really to be part of the charm?the measure of herpossibility. Boston even was thinkable as subject to mutation; had I notin fact just seemed to myself to catch her in the almost uncannyinconsequence of change? There had been for Boston the old epigram thatshe wasnt a place, but a state of mind; and that might remain, since weknow how frequently states of mind alter. Philadelphia then wasnt aplace, but a state of consanguinity, which is an absolute finalcondition. She had arrived at it, with nothing in the world left tobristle for, or against; whereas New York, and above all Chicago, wereonly, and most precariously, on the way to it, and indeed, havingstarted too late, would probably never arrive. There were, for them,interferences and complications; they knew, and would yet know, otherconditions, perhaps other beatitudes; only the beatitude I speak ofthatof being, in the composed sense, a societywas lost to them forever.Philadelphia, without complications or interferences, enjoyed it inparticular through having begun to invoke it in time. And now she hadnothing more to invoke; she had everything; her _cadres_ were all full;her imagination was at peace. This, exactly again, would be the reasonof the bristling of the other places: the _cadres_ of New York, Chicago,Boston, being as to a third of them empty and as to another thirdobjectionably filledwith much consequent straining, reaching, heaving,both to attain and to eject. What makes a society was thus, more thananything else, the number of organic social relations it represents; bywhich logic Philadelphia would represent nothing _but_ organic socialrelations. The degrees of consanguinity were the _cadres_; every one ofthem was full; it was a society in which every individual was as manytimes over cousin, uncle, aunt, niece, and so on through the list, aspoor human nature is susceptible of being. These degrees are, when onereflects, the only really organic social relations, and when they areall there for every one the scheme of security, in a community, has beenworked out. Philadelphia, in other words, would not only be a family,she would be a happy one, and a probable proof that the happinesscomes as a matter of course if the family but be large enough.Consanguinity provides the marks and features, the type and tone andease, the common knowledge and the common consciousness, but numberwould be required to make these things social. Number, accordingly, forher perfection, was what Philadelphia would haveit having been clear tome still, in my charming Club and at my illuminating window, that shecouldnt _not_ be perfect. She would be, of all goodly villages, thevery goodliest, probably, in the world; the very largest, and flattest,and smoothest, the most rounded and complete.                                   IIThe simplest account of such success as I was to have in putting myvision to the test will be, I think, to say that the place never for amoment belied to me that forecast of its animated intimacy. Yet it mightbe just here that a report of my experience would find itselfhamperedthis learning the lesson, from one vivid page of thepicture-book to another, of how perfectly intimate Philadelphia is.Such an exhibition would be, prohibitively, the exhibition of privatethings, of private things only, and of a charmed contact with them, wereit not for the great circumstance which, when what I have said has beenfully said, remains to be taken into account. The state of infinitecousinship colours the scene, makes the predominant tone; but you get alight upon it that is worth all others from the moment you see it as,ever so savingly, historic. This perception moreover promptly operates;I found it stirred, as soon as I went out or began to circulate, by allimmediate aspects and signs. The place went back; or, in other words,the social equilibrium, forestalling so that of the other cities, hadbegun early, had had plenty of time on its side, and thus had itshistory behind itthe past that looms through it, not at all luridly,but so squarely and substantially, to-day, and gives it, by a mercy, anextension other than the lateral. This, frankly, was required, it struckme, for the full comfort of ones impressionfor a certain desirable andimputable richness. The backward extension, in short, is the very makingof Philadelphia; one is so uncertain of the value one would attach toher being as she is, if she hadnt been so by prescription and for acouple of centuries. This has established her right and her competence;the fact is the parent, so to speak, of her consistency and serenity; ithas made the very law under which her parts and pieces have held soclosely together. To walk her streets is to note with all promptnessthat William Penn _must_ have laid them outno one else could possiblyhave done it so ill. It was his best, though, with our larger sense fora street, it is far from ours; we at any rate no more complain of them,nor suggest that they might have been more liberally conceived, than weso express ourselves about the form of the chairs in sitting through amorning call.I found myself liking them, then, as I moved among them, just inproportion as they conformed, in detail, to the early patternthefigure, for each house, of the red-faced old gentleman whose thickeyebrows and moustache have turned to white; and I found myselfdetesting them in any instance of a new front or a new fashion. Theywere narrow, with this aspect as of a double file of grizzled veterans,or they were nothing; the narrowness had been positively the channel orconduit of continuity of character: it made the long pipe on which thetune of the place was played. From the moment it was in any waycorrected the special charm brokethe charm, a rare civic possession, asof some immense old ruled and neatly-inked chart, not less carefullythan benightedly flattened out, stretching its tough parchment under thevery feet of all comings and goings. This was an image with which, as itfurthermore seemed to me, everything else consortedabove all thesoothing truth that Philadelphia was, yes, beyond cavil, solely andsingly Philadelphian. There was an interference absent, or one that I atleast never met: that sharp note of the outlandish, in the strict senseof the word, which I had already found almost everywhere sodisconcerting. I pretend here of course neither to estimate the numbersin which the grosser aliens may actually have settled on these blandbanks of the Delaware, nor to put my finger on the principle of theshock I had felt it, and was still to feel it, in their general power toadminister; for I am not now concerned so much with the impression madeby ones almost everywhere meeting them, as with the impression made byones here and there failing of it. They may have been gathered, intheir hordes, in some vast quarter unknown to me and of which I was tohave no glimpse; but what would this have denoted, exactly, but somevirtue in the air for reducing their presence, or their effect, tonaught? There precisely was the difference from New Yorkthat theythemselves had been in that place half the virtue, or the vice, of theair, and that there were few of its agitations to which they had notsomething to say.The logic of the case had been visible to me, for that matter, on myvery first drive from the trainfrom that precious Pennsylvaniastation of Philadelphia which was to strike me as making a nearerapproach than elsewhere to the arts of ingratiation. There was an objector two, windowed and chimneyed, in the central skybut nothing to speakof: I then and there, in a word, took in the admirable flatness. And ifit seemed so spacious, by the same token, this was because it wasneither eager, nor grasping, nor pushing. It drew its breath at itsease, clearlynever sounding the charge, the awful Step lively! of NewYork. The fury of the pavement had dropped, in fine, as I was to see itdrop, later on, between Chicago and St. Louis. This affected me on thespot of symbolic, and I was to have no glimpse of anything that gainsaidthe symbol. It was somehow, too, the very note of the homogeneous;though this indeed is not, oddly enough, the head under which at St.Louis my impression was to range itself. I at all events here gavemyself up to the visionthat of the vast, firm chess-board, theimmeasurable spread of little squares, covered _all_ over by perfectPhiladelphians. It was an image, in face of some of the other featuresof the view, dissimilar to any by which one had ever in ones life beenassaulted; and this elimination of the foreign element has been what wasrequired to make it consummate. Nothing is more notable, through theStates at large, than that hazard of what one may happen, or may nothappen, to see; but the only use to be made of either accident is,clearly, to let it stand and to let it serve. This intensity andubiquity of the local tone, that of the illimitable _town_, serves sosuccessfully for my sense of Philadelphia that I should feel as if alittle masterpiece of the creative imagination had been destroyed by theleast correction. And there is, further, the point to make that if Iknew, all the while, that there was something more, and different, andless beatific, under and behind the happy appearance I grasped, I knewit by no glimmer of direct perception, and should never in the worldhave guessed it if some sound of it had not, by a discordant voice,been, all superfluously, rather tactlessly, dropped into my ear.It was not, however, disconcerting at the time, this presentation, as ina flash, of the other side of the medalthe other side being, in a word,as was mentioned to me, one of the most lurid pages in the annals ofpolitical corruption. The place, by this revelation, was two distinctthingsa Society, from far back, the society I had divined, the mostgenial and delightful one could think of, and then, parallel to this,and not within it, nor quite altogether above it, but beside it andbeneath it, behind it and before it, enclosing it as in a frame of firein which it still had the secret of keeping cool, a proportionate City,the most incredible that ever was, organized all for plunder and rapine,the gross satisfaction of official appetite, organized for eternaliniquity and impunity. Such were the conditions, it had been hinted tomefrom the moment the medal spun round; but I even understate, I think,in speaking of the knowledge as only not disconcerting. It was betterthan that, for it positively added the last touch of colour to my framedand suspended picture. Here, strikingly then, was an American _case_,and presumably one of the best; one of the best, that is, for some studyof the wondrous problem, admiration and amazement of the nations, whoyearn over it from far off: the way in which sane Society and pestilentCity, in the United States, successfully cohabit, each keeping it upwith so little of fear or flutter from the other. The thing presentsitself, in its prime unlikelihood, as a thorough good neighbouring ofthe Happy Family and the Infernal Machinethe machine so rooted as tocontinue to defy removal, and the family still so indifferent, while itcarries on the family business of buying and selling, of chattering anddancing, to the danger of being blown up. It is all puzzled out, fromafar, as a matter of the exchange, and in a large decree of theobservance, from side to side, of guarantees, and the interesting thingto get at, for the student of manners, will ever be just this mystery ofthe terms of the bargain. I must add, none the less, that, though onewas ones self, inevitably and always and everywhere, that student, myattention happened to be, or rather was obliged to be, confined to oneview of the agreement. The arrangement is, obviously, between the greatmunicipalities and the great populations, on the grand scale, and Ilacked opportunity to look at it all round. I had but my glimpse of theapparently wide social acceptance of itthat is I saw but the face ofthe medal most directly turned to the light of day, and could note thatnowhere so much as in Philadelphia was any carking care, in the socialmind, any uncomfortable consciousness, as of a skeleton at the banquetof life, so gracefully veiled.This struck me (on my looking back afterwards with more knowledge) asadmirable, as heroic, in its way, and as falling in altogether withinherent habits of sociability, gaiety, gallantry, with that feltpresence of a temperament with which the original Quaker drab seems toflushgiving it, as one might say for the sake of the figure, somethingof the iridescence of the breast of a well-fed dove. The original Quakerdrab is still there, and, ideally, for the picture, up and down theuniform streets, one should see a bland, broad-brimmed, square-toedgentleman, or a bonneted, kerchiefed, mittened lady, on every littleflight of white steps; but the very note of the place has been theworldly overscoring, for most of the senses, of the primitivemonotone, the bestitching of the drab with pink and green and silver.The mixture has been, for a social effect, admirably successful, thanks,one seems to see, to the subtle, the charming absence of pedantry in theQuaker purity. It flushes gracefully, that temperate prejudice (with itspredisposition to the universal _tutoiement_), turning first but to theprettiest pink; so that we never quite know where the drab has ended andthe colour of the world has begun. The disfrocked Catholic is toostrange, the paganized Puritan too angular; it is the accommodatingFriend who has most the secret of a _modus vivendi_. And if it be asked,I may add, whether, in this case of social Philadelphia, the genius forlife, and what I have called the gallantry of it above all, wouldnthave been better shown by a scorn of _any_ compromise to which thenefarious City could invite it, I can only reply that, as a lover,always of romantic phenomena, and an inveterate seeker for them, Ishould have been deprived, by the action of that particular virtue, ofthe thrilled sense of a society dancing, all consciously, on the thincrust of a volcano. It is the thinness of the crust that makes, in suchexamples, the wild fantasy, the gay bravery, of the dancejust as Iadmit that a preliminary, an original extinction of the volcano wouldhave illustrated another kind of virtue. The crust, for the socialtread, would in this case have been firm, but the spectatorsimagination would have responded less freely, I think, to the appeal ofthe scene. If I may indeed speak my whole thought for him he would sohave had to drop again, to his regret, the treasure of a small analogypicked up on its very threshold.How shall he confess at once boldly and shyly enough that the situationhad at the end of a very short time begun to strike him, for all itsimmeasurably reduced and simplified form, as a much nearer approach tothe representation of an old order, an _ancien rgime_, sociallyspeaking, than any the field of American manners had seemed likely toregale him with? Grotesque the comparison if pushed; yet how had heencountered the similitude if it hadnt been hanging about? From themoment he adopted it, at any rate, he found it taking on touch aftertouch. The essence of old orders, as history lights them, is just thatinnocent beatitude of consanguinity, of the multiplication of theassured felicities, to which I have already alluded. From this, inPhiladelphia, didnt the rest follow?the sense, for every one, of beingin the same boat with every one else, a closed circle that would finditself happy enough if only it could remain closed enough. The boatmight considerably pitch, but its occupants would either float merrilytogether or (almost as merrily) go down together, and meanwhile therisk, the vague danger, the jokes to be made about it, the generalquickened sociability and intimacy, were the very music of theexcursion. There are even yet to be observed about the world fragmentsand ghosts of old social orders, thin survivals of final cataclysms, andit was not less positive than beguiling that the common marks by whichthese companies are known, and which we still distinguish through theirbedimmed condition, cropped up for me in the high American light, makinggood my odd parallel at almost every point. Yet if these signs of aslightly congested, but still practically self-sufficing, little worldwere all there, they were perhaps there most, to my ear, in the fact ofthe little worlds proper intimate idiom and accent: a dialect as muchits very own, even in drawing-rooms and libraries, as the Venetian isthat of Venice or the Neapolitan is that of Naplesrepresenting thecommon things of association, the things easily understood and felt, andcharged as no other vehicle could be with the fund of local reference.There is always the difference, of course, that at Venice and at Naples,in society, an alternative, either that of French or of the classic,the more or less academic Italian, is offered to the uninitiatedstranger, whereas in Philadelphia he is candidly, consistently,sometimes almost contagiously entertained in the free vernacular. Thelatter may easily become, in fact, under its wealth of idiosyncrasy andif he have the favouring turn of mind, a tempting object of linguisticstudy; with the bridge built for him, moreover, that, unlike theVenetian, the Neapolitan and most other local languages, it contains,itself, colloquially, a notable element of the academic and the classic.It struck me even, truly, as, with a certain hardness in it,_constituting_ the society that employed itvery much as the egg is madeoval by its shell; and really, if I may say all, as taking its stand abit consciously sometimes, if not a bit defiantly, on its own provedgenius. I remember the visible dismay of a gentleman, a pilgrim fromafar, in a drawing-room, at the comment of a lady, a lady of one of thenew generations indeed, and mistress of the tone by which I had here andthere occasion to observe that such ornaments of the new generationmight be known. Listen to the creature: he speaks English!it was thevery opposite of the indulgence or encouragement with which, in aVenetian drawing-room (I catch my analogies as I can) the sound ofFrench or of Italian might have been greeted. The poor creaturesdismay was so visible, clearly, for the reason that such things haveonly to be said with a certain confidence to create a certainconfusionthe momentary consciousness of some such misdeed, from thepoint of view of manners, as the speaking of Russian at Warsaw. I havesaid that Philadelphia didnt bristle, but the heroine of my anecdotecaused the so genial city to resemble, for the minute, linguistically,an unreconciled Poland.                                  IIIBut why do I talk of the new generations, or at any rate of the abyss inthem that may seem here and there beyond ones shallow sounding, when,all the while, at the back of my head, hovers the image in the guise ofwhich antiquity in Philadelphia looks most seated and most interesting?Nowhere throughout the country, I think, unless it be perchance at MountVernon, does our historic past so enjoy the felicity of an importantconcrete illustration. It survives there in visible form as it nowhereelse survives, and one can doubtless scarce think too largely of whatits mere felicity of presence, in these conditions, has done, andcontinues, and will continue, to do for the place at large. It may seemwitless enough, at this time of day, to arrive from Pennsylvania withnews of the old State House, and my news, I can only recognize, beganbut with being news for myselfin which character it quite shamelesslypretended both to freshness and to brilliancy. Why _shouldnt_ it havebeen charming, the high roof under which the Declaration of Independencehad been signed?that was of course a question that might from the firsthave been asked of me, and with no better answer in wait for it thanthat, after all, it might just have happened, in the particularconditions, not to be; or else that, in general, one is allowed amargin, on the spot, for the direct sense of consecrated air, for thatcommunication of its spirit which, in proportion as the spirit has beengreat, withholds itself, shyly and nobly, from any mere forecast. Thisit is exactly that, by good fortune, keeps up the sanctity of shrinesand the lessons of history, to say nothing of the freshness ofindividual sensibility and the general continuity of things. There ispositively nothing of Independence Hall, of its fine old Georgianamplitude and decency, its large serenity and symmetry of pink and drab,and its actual emphasis of detachment from the vulgar brush of things,that is _not_ charming; and there is nothing, the city through, thatdoesnt receive a mild sidelight, that of a reflected interest, from itsneighbourhood.This element of the reflected interest, and more particularly of thereflected distinction, is for the most part, on the American scene, themissed interestdespite the ingenuities of wealth and industry andenergy that strain so touchingly often, and even to grimace andcontortion, somehow to supply it. One finds ones self, when it _has_happened to intervene, weighing its action to the last grain of gold.One even puts to ones self fantastic cases, such as the question, forinstance, of what might, what might _not_ have happened if poor dearreckless New York had been so distinguished or so blestwith the badconscience she is too intelligent not to have, her power to be now andthen ashamed of her form, lodged, after all, somewhere in herinterminable boots. One has of course to suppress there the promptconviction that the blessingthat of the possession of an historicalmonument of the first orderwould long since have been replaced by thehigher advantage of a row of sky-scrapers yielding rents; yet theimagination none the less dallies with the fond vision of some respectsomehow instilled, some deference somehow suggested, some revelation ofthe possibilities of a public _tenue_ somehow effected. Fascinating infact to speculate a little as to what a New York held in respect bysomething or other, some power not of the purse, might have become. Itis bad, ever, for lusty youth, especially with a command of means, togrow up without knowing at least one nice familyif the family be notpriggish; and this is the danger that the young Philadelphia, with itseyes on the superior connection I am speaking of, was enabled to escape.The charming old pink and drab heritage of the great time was to be thesuperior connection, playing, for the education of the place, the partof the nice family. Socially, morally, even sthetically, the place wasto be thus more or less inevitably built round it; but for which goodfortune who knows if even Philadelphia too might have not been vulgar?One meets throughout the land enough instances of the opposite luckthesituation of immense and successful communities that have lacked,originally, anything first-rate, as they might themselves put it, tobe built round; anything better, that is, than some profitable hole inthe earth, some confluence of rivers or command of lakes or railroads:and one sees how, though this deficiency may not have made itself feltat first, it has inexorably loomed larger and larger, the drawback of itgrowing all the while with the growth of the place. Our sense of suchpredicaments, for the gatherings of men, comes back, I think, and withan intensity of interest, to our sense of the way the human imaginationabsolutely declines everywhere to go to sleep without some apology atleast for a supper. The collective consciousness, in however empty anair, gasps for a relation, as intimate as possible, to somethingsuperior, something as central as possible, from which it may more orless have proceeded and round which its life may revolveand its dimdesire is always, I think, to do it justice, that this object orpresence shall have had as much as possible an heroic or romanticassociation. But the difficulty is that in these later times, among suchaggregations, the heroic and romantic elements, even under the earliestrude stress, have been all too tragically obscure, belonged tosmothered, unwritten, almost unconscious private history: so that thecentral something, the social _point de repre_, has had to beextemporized rather pitifully after the fact, and made to consist of thebiggest hotel or the biggest common school, the biggest factory, thebiggest newspaper office, or, for climax of desperation, the house ofthe biggest billionaire. These are the values resorted to in default ofhigher, for with _some_ coloured rag or other the general imagination,snatching its chance, must dress its doll.As a real, a moral value, to the general mind, at all events, and not asa trumped-up one, I saw the lucky legacy of the past, at Philadelphia,operate; though I admit that these are, at best, for the mooningobserver, matters of appreciation, mysteries of his own sensibility.Such an observer has early to perceive, and to conclude on it once forall, that there will be little for him in the American scene unless hebe ready, anywhere, everywhere, to read into it as much as he readsout. It is at its best for him when most open to that friendlypenetration, and not at its best, I judge, when practically most closedto it. And yet how can I pretend to be able to say, under thisdiscrimination, what was better and what was worse in IndependenceHall?to say how far the charming facts struck me as going ofthemselves, or where the imagination (perhaps on this sole patch ofground, by exception, a meddler not wanted anyhow) took them up tocarry them further. I am reduced doubtless to the comparative sophism ofmaking my better sense here consist but of my sense of the fine interiorof the building. One sees them immediately as good, delightfully good,on architectural and scenic lines, these large, high, wainscotedchambers, as good as any could thinkably have been at the time;embracing what was to be done in them with such a noble congruity (whichin all the conditions they might readily have failed of, though theywere no mere tent pitched for the purpose) that the historicimagination, reascending the centuries, almost catches them in the actof directly suggesting the celebrated _coup_. One fancies, under thehigh spring of the ceiling and before the great embrasured window-sashesof the principal room, some clever man of the period, after a long lookround, taking the hint. _What_ an admirable place for a Declaration ofsomething! What could one herewhat _couldnt_ one really declare? Andthen after a moment: I say, why not our Independence?capital thingalways to declare, and before any one gets in with anything tactless.Youll see that the fortune of the place will be made. It really takessome such frivolous fancy as that to represent with proper extravagancethe reflection irresistibly rising there and that it yet would seempedantic to express with solemnity: the sense, namely, of our beautifulescape in not having had to declare in any way meanly, of our goodfortune in having found half the occasion made to our hand.High occasions consist of many things, and it was extraordinary luck forour great date that not one of these, even as to surface and appearance,should have been wanting. There might easily have been traps laid for usby some of the inferior places, but I am convinced (and more completelythan of anything else in the whole connection) that the genius ofhistoric decency would have kept us enslaved rather than have seen uscommitted to one of those. In that light, for the intelligent pilgrim,the Philadelphia monument becomes, under his tread, under the touch ofhis hand and the echo of his voice, the very prize, the sacred thingitself, contended for and gained; so that its quality, in fine, isirresistible and its dignity not to be uttered. I was so conscious, formyself, I confess, of the intensity of this perception, that I dip deepinto the whole remembrance without touching bottom; by which I mean thatI grope, reminiscentially, in the full basin of the general experienceof the spot without bringing up a detail. Distinct to me only the wayits character, so clear yet so ample, everywhere hangs together andkeeps itself up; distinct to me only the large sense, in halls andspreading staircase and long-drawn upper gallery, of one of those rareprecincts of the past against which the present has kept beating invain. The present comes in and stamps about and very stertorouslybreathes, but its sounds are as naught the next moment; it is as if onefelt there that the grandparent, reserved, irresponsive now, and havingspoken his word, in his finest manner, once for all, must have long agohad enough of the exuberance of the young grandsons modernity. But ofcourse the great impression is that of the persistent actuality of theso auspicious room in which the Signers saw their tossing ship intoport. The lapse of time here, extraordinarily, has sprung no leak in theeffect; it remains so robust that everything lives again, the intervaldrops out and we mingle in the business: the old ghosts, to our inwardsensibility, still make the benches creak as they free their fullcoat-skirts for sitting down; still make the temperature rise, the pensscratch, the papers flutter, the dust float in the large sun-shafts; weplace them as they sit, watch them as they move, hear them as theyspeak, pity them as they ponder, know them, in fine, from the arch oftheir eyebrows to the shuffle of their shoes.I am not sure indeed that, for mere archaic insolence, the little oldHall of the Guild of Carpenters, my vision of which jostles my memory ofthe State House, does not carry it even with a higher handin spite of abedizenment of restoration, within, which leads us to rejoice that theretouchings of the greater monument expose themselves comparatively solittle. The situation of this elegant structureof dimensions and formthat scarce differ, as I recall them, from those of delicate littleHolden Chapel, of the so floridly-overlaid gable, most articulate singleword, in College Yard, of the small builded sense of old Harvardcomesnearer to representing an odd town-nook than any other corner ofAmerican life that I remember; American life having been organized, _abovo_, with an hostility to the town-nook which has left no scrap ofprovision for eyes needing on occasion a refuge from the general glare.The general glare seemed to me, at the end of something like a passage,in the shade of something like a court, and in the presence of somethinglike a relic, to have mercifully intermitted, on that fine Philadelphiamorning; I wont answer for the exact correspondence of the conditionswith my figure of them, since the shade I speak of may have been but theshade of tall buildings, the vulgarest of new accidents. Yet I let myimpression stand, if only as a note of the relief certain always tolurk, at any turn of the American scene, in the appearance of anyindividual thing within, or behind, or at the end, or in the depth, ofany other individual thing. It makes for the sense of complexity,relieves the eternal impression of things all in a row and of a singlethickness, an impression which the usual unprecedented length of theAmerican alignment (always its source of pride) does by itself little tomitigate. Nothing in the array is behind anything elsean odd result,I admit, of the fact that so many things affirm themselves aspreponderantly before. Little Carpenters Hall _was_, delightfully,somewhere behind; so much behind, as I perhaps thus fantastically seeit, that I dare say I should not be able to find my way to it again if Iwere to try. Nothing, for that matter, would induce me to revisit infact, I feel, the object I so fondly evoke. It might have been, for thisbeautiful posteriority, somewhere in the City of London.                                   IVI can but continue to lose myself, for these connections, in my _whole_sense of the intermission, as I have called it, of the glare. Themellower light prevailed, somehow, _all_ that fine Philadelphia morning,as well as on two or three other occasionsand I cannot, after all,pretend I dont now see why. It was because ones experience of theplace had become immediately an intimate thingintimate with thatintimacy that I had tasted, from the first, in the local air; so that,inevitably, thus, there was no keeping of distinct accounts for publicand private items. An ancient church or two, of aspect as Anglican stillas you please, and taking, for another case, from the indifferent bustleround it, quite the look of Wrens mere steepled survivals in thebackwaters of London churchyards; Franklins grave itself, in its ownbackwater of muffled undulations, close to the indifferent bustle;Franklins admirable portrait by Duplessis in the council-room of anancient, opulent Trust, a conservative Company, vague and awful to myshy sense, that was housed after the fashion of some exclusive,madeira-drinking old gentleman with obsequious heirs: these and othermatters, wholly thrilling at the time, float back to me as on thecurrent of talk and as in the flood, so to speak, of hospitality. IfPhiladelphia had, in opposition to so many other matters, struck me ascoherent, there would be surely no point of ones contact at which thismight so have come home as in those mysterious chambers and before themost interesting of the many far-scattered portraits of Franklintheportrait working as some sudden glimpse of the fine old incised seal,kept in its glass cabinet, that had originally stamped all over, foridentification, the comparatively soft local wax. One thinks ofFranklins reputation, of his authorityand however much they may havebeen locally contested at the timeas marking the material about himmuch as his name might have marked his underclothing or hispocket-books. Small surprise one had the impression of a Society, withsuch a figure as that to start conversation. He seemed to preside overit all while one lingered there, as if he had been seated, at themahogany, relentingly enough, near his glass of madeira; seemed to bein it even more freely than by the so interesting fact of his stillhaving, in Philadelphia, in New York, in Boston, through his daughter,so numerous a posterity. The sense of life, life the most positive, mosthuman and most miscellaneous, expressed in his aged, crumpled, cannyface, where the smile wittily profits, for fineness, by the comparativecollapse of the mouth, represents a suggestion which succeedinggenerations may well have found it all they could do to work out. It isimpossible, in the place, after seeing that portrait, not to feel himstill with them, with the genial generationseven though to-day, in thelarger, more mixed cup, the force of his example may have suffered somedilution.It was a savour of which, at any rate, for ones own draught, one couldbut make the most; and I went so far, on this occasion, as fairly totaste it there in the very quality of my companyin that of thedistinguished guidance and protection I was enjoying, which could onlymake me ask myself in what finer modern form one would have wished tosee Franklins humanity and sagacity, his variety and ingenuity, hiswealth of ideas and his tireless application of them, embodied. Therewas verily nothing to do, after this, but to play over the generalpicture that light of his assumption of the general ease of thingsofthings at any rate thereabouts; so that I now see each reminiscence,whatever the time or the place, happily governed and coloured by it.Times and places, in such an experience, ranged themselves, after aspace, like valued objects in one of the assorted rooms of acollection. Keep them a little, tenderly handled, wrapped up, stowedaway, and they then come forth, into the room swept and garnished,susceptible of almost any pleasing arrangement. The only thing is thatyou shall scarce know, at a given moment, amid your abundance, which ofthem to take up first; there being always in them, moreover, at best,the drawback of value from mere association, that keepsake element ofobjects in a reliquary. Is not this, however, the drawback forexhibition of almost any item of American experience that may notpretend to deal with the mere monstrosities?the immensities of size andspace, of trade and traffic, of organisation, political, educational,economic. From the moment ones record is not, in fine, a loudstatistical shout, it falls into the order of those shy things thatspeak, at the most (when one is ones self incapable even of the mereststatistical whisper), but of the personal adventurein other words butof ones luck and of ones sensibility. There are incidents, there arepassages, that flush, in this fashion, to the backward eye, under thetorch. But what solemn statement is one to make of the importance, forexample, of such a matter as the Academy soire (as they say in London)of the Philadelphia winter, the festive commemoration of some long spanof life achieved by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts? We may havebeen thrilled, positively, by the occasion, by the interestingencounters and discoveries, artistic and personal, to which itministered; we may have moved from one charmed recognition to another,noting Sargents and Whistlers by the dozen, and old forgotten Frenchfriends, foreign friends in general, older and younger; noting youngnative upstarts, creatures of yesterday and to-morrow, who invite, withall success, a stand and a stare; but no after-sense of such vibrations,however lively, presumes to take itself as communicable.One would regret, on the other hand, failing to sound some echo of amessage everywhere in the United States so audible; that of theclamorous signs of a hungry social growth, the very pulses, making alltheir noise, of the engine that works night and day for a theory ofcivilization. There are moments at which it may well seem that, puttingthe sense of the spectacle even at its lowest, there is no suchamusement as this anywhere supplied; the air through which everythingshows is so transparent, with steps and stages and processes as distinctin it as the appearance, from a street-corner, of a crowd rushing on analarm to a fire. The gregarious crowd tells, in the street, and theindications I speak of tell, like chalk-marks, on the demonstrativeAmerican black-boardan impression perhaps never so much brought home tome as by a wondrous Sunday morning at the edge of a vast vacantPhiladelphia street, a street not of Penns creation and vacant ofeverything but an immeasurable bourgeois blankness. I had turned fromthat scene into a friendly house that was given over, from top to toe,to a dazzling collection of pictures, amid which I felt myself catch inthe very act one of the great ingurgitations of the hungry machine, andrecognize as well how perfect were all the conditions for making it acase. What could have testified less, on the face of it, than thecandour of the streets insignificance?a pair of huge parted lipsprotesting almost to pathos their innocence of anything to say: whichwas exactly, none the less, where appetite had broken out and wasfeeding itself to satiety. Large and liberal the hospitality, remarkablyrich the store of acquisition, in the light of which the whole energy ofthe keen collector showed: the knowledge, the acuteness, the audacity,the incessant watch for opportunity. These abrupt and multipliedencounters, intensities, ever so various, of individual curiosity, soundthe sthetic note sometimes with unprecedented shrillness and then againwith the most muffled discretion. Was the note muffled or shrill,meanwhile, as I listened to itunder a fascination I fullyrecognizedduring an hour spent in the clustered palstra of theUniversity of Pennsylvania? Here the winter afternoon seemed to throwitself artfully back, across the centuries, the climates, the seasons,the very faiths and codes, into the air of old Greece and the age ofgymnastic glory: artfully, I rather insist, because I scarce know whatfine emphasis of modernism hung about it too. I put that question,however, only to deny myself the present luxury of answering it; sothickly do the visitors University impressions, over the land, tend togather, and so markedly they suggest their being reported of together. Inote my palstral hour, therefore, but because it fell through what itseemed to show me, straight into what I had conceived of thePhiladelphia scheme, the happy family given up, though quite on familylines, to all the immediate beguilements and activities; the art inparticular of cultivating, with such gaiety as might be, a brave civicblindness.I became conscious of but one excrescence on this large smooth surface;it is true indeed that the excrescence was huge and affected me asdemanding in some way to be dealt with. The Pennsylvania Penitentiaryrears its ancient grimness, its grey towers and defensive moats (massesat least that uncertain memory so figures for me) in an outlying quarterwhich struck me as borrowing from them a vague likeness to some more orless blighted minor city of Italy or France, black Angers or deadFerrarayet seated on its basis of renown and wrapped in its legend ofhaving, as the first flourishing example of the strictly cellularsystem, the complete sequestration of the individual prisoner, thoughtwonderful in its day, moved Charles Dickens to the passionate protestrecorded in his _American Notes_. Of such substance was the story ofthese battlements; yet it was unmistakable that when one had crossed thedrawbridge and passed under the portcullis the air seemed thick enoughwith the breath of the generations. A prison has, at the worst, themassive majesty, the sinister peace of a prison; but this huge house ofsorrow affected me as, uncannily, of the City itself, the City of allthe cynicisms and impunities against which my friends had, from farback, kept plating, as with the old silver of their sideboards, thearmour of their social consciousness. It made the whole place, with someof its oddly antique aspects and its oddly modern freedoms, look doublycut off from the world of light and ease. The suggestions here werevast, however; too many of them swarm, and my imagination must defenditself as it can. What I was most concerned to note was the completeturn of the wheel of fortune in respect to the measure of mereincarceration suffered, from which the worst of the rigour had visiblybeen drawn. Parts of the place suggested a sunny Club at a languid hour,with members vaguely lounging and chatting, with open doors andcomparatively cheerful vistas, and plenty of rocking-chairs andmagazines. The only thing was that, under this analogy, one found onesself speculating much on the implied requisites for membership. It wasimpossible not to wonder, from face to face, what these would have been,and not to ask what one would have taken them to be if the appearance ofa Club had been a little more complete. I almost blush, I fear, for thecrude comfort of my prompt conclusion. One would have taken them toconsist, without exception, of full-blown basenesses; one couldnt, frommember to member, from type to type, from one pair of eyes to another,take them for anything less. Where was the victim of circumstances,where the creature merely misled or betrayed? He fitted no type, hesuffered in no face, he yearned in no history, and one felt, the moreone took in his absence, that the numerous substitutes for him were goodenough for each other.The great interest was in this sight of the number and variety of waysof looking morally mean; and perhaps also in the question of how muchthe effect came from its being proved upon them, of how little it mighthave come if they had still been out in the world. Considered ascriminals the moral meanness here was their explication. Considered asmorally mean, therefore, would possible criminality, out in the world,have been in the same degree their sole sense? Was the fact of prison_all_ the mere fact of opportunity, and the fact of freedom all the merefact of the absence of it? One inclined to believe thatthesimplification was at any rate so great for ones feeling: the casespresented became thus, consistently, cases of the vocation, and from themoment this was clear the place took on, in its way, almost the harmonyof a convent. I talked for a long time with a charming reprievedmurderer whom I half expected, at any moment, to see ring for coffee andcigars: he explained with all urbanity, and with perfect lucidity, thereal sense of the appearance against him, but I none the less felt surethat his merit was largely in the refinement wrought in him by so manyyears of easy club life. He was as natural a subject for commutation asfor conviction, and had had to have the latter in order to have theformerin the enjoyment, and indeed in the subtle criticism, of which,_as_ simple commutation he was at his best. They were there, all thoseof his companions, I was able to note, unmistakably at their best. Onecould, as I say, sufficiently rest in it, and to do that kept, in amanner, the excrescence, as I have called it, on the general scene,within bounds. I was moreover luckily to see the general scenedefinitely cleared again, cleared of everything save its own socialcharacter and its practical philosophyand at no moment with thesefeatures so brightly presented as during a few days rage of winterround an old country-house. The house was virtually distant from town,and the conditions could but strike any visitor who stood whenever hemight with his back to the fire, where the logs were piled high, as madeto press on all the reserves and traditions of the general temperament;those of gallantry, hilarity, social disposability, crowned with thegrace of the sporting instinct. What was it confusedly, almostromantically, like, what old order commemorated in fiction andanecdote? I had groped for this, as I have shown, before, but I foundmyself at it again. Wasnt it, for freedom of movement, for jingle ofsleigh-bells, for breasting of the elements, for cross-country drives inthe small hours, for _crnerie_ of fine young men and high wintry colourof muffled nymphs, wasnt it, brogue and all, like some audible echo ofclose-packing, chancing Irish society of the classic time, seen andheard through a roaring blizzard? That at least, with his back to thefire, was where the restless analyst was landed.                                   X                               BALTIMORE                                   IIt had doubtless not been merely absurd, as the wild winter proceeded,to find ones self so enamoured of the very name of the South that onewas ready to take it in any small atmospheric instalment and to feel theecho of its voice in the yell of any engine that happened not to dragone either directly North or directly West. One tended at least, onthese terms, in some degree, toward the land where the citron blooms,and that was something to go on with, a handful of small change acceptedfor the time as a pledge of great gold pieces to come. It isastonishing, along the Atlantic coast, how, from the moment the Northceases to insist, the South may begin to presume; ever so little, nodoubt, at first, yet with protrusive feelers that tell how she onlywants the right sensibility, the true waiting victim, to play upon. Itis a question certainly of where, on the so frequently torpid stretch ofshore I speak of, the North does cease to insist; or perhaps I shouldmore correctly say a question of when it does. It appeared incapable ofthis fine tact almost anywhere, I confess, at the season, the firstsupposedly relenting weeks, of my facing in earnest to Florida; and theinterest indeed of that slightly grim adventure was to be in the way itministered to the coincidence, for me, of two quite opposed strains ofreflection. On the one hand nothing could say more to the subject longexpatriated, condemned by the terms of his exile to a chronicconsciousness of grey northern seas, than to feel how, from New York, oreven from Boston, he had but to sit still in his portentous car, had butto exercise a due concentrated patience, in order to become aware,without personal effort or suffered transfer, of that most charming ofall watchable processes, the gradual soft, the distinctivelydemoralized, conversion of the soul of Nature. This conversion, if I mayso put it without profanity, has always struck me, on any southwardcourse, as a return, on the part of that soul, from a comparatively grimTheistic faith to the ineradicable principle of Paganism; a consciouscasting-off of the dread theological abstractionan abstraction still,even with all Puritan stiffeningin the interest of multiplied, lurking,familiar powers; divinities, graces, presences as unseen but as inherentas the scents clinging to the folds of Natures robe. It would be onsuch occasions the fault of the divine familiars themselves if theirhaunts and shrines were empty, for earth and air and day and night, aswe go, still affect us as moods of their sympathy, still vibrate to thebreath of their passage; so that our progress, under the expanding sun,resembles a little less a journey through space than a retracing of thecourse of the ages.These are fine fancies, however, and what is more to my point is thatthe theory (so agreeable to entertain at Jersey City) of a directconnection between the snow-banks and the orange-groves is a thing ofsweetness only so long as practically unshaken. There is continuity,goodness knows, always in Americait is the last thing that is everbroken: the question for the particular case is but continuity of what?The basis of my individual hope had been that of the reign of theorange-grove; but what it proved, at the crisis I name, was positivelythat of the usurpation of the snow-bank. It was possible, indubitably,in such conditions, to go to Charleston on sledgeswhich made in fact,after all, for directness of connection. It made moreover, by the sametoken, for a certain sinister light on the general truth of our grandterritorial unity. It was as if the winter, at the end of February,abroad for a walk, had marched as promptly and inevitably from theArctic Circle to the Gulf as it might have proceeded, with pride in itshuge clear course, from the top of Broadway to the Battery. This broughthome again, as I myself went, I remember, one of those three or fourmain ideas, suggested by the recurrent conditions, which become asobsessions for the traveller in the Statesif he have a mind, that is,so indecently exposed to ideas: the sense, constantly fed, and from ahundred sources, that, as Nature abhors a vacuum, so it is of the geniusof the American land and the American people to abhor, whenever may be,a discrimination. They are reduced, together, under stress, to makingdiscriminations, but they make them, I think, as lightly and scantily aspossible. With the lively insistence of that impression, even though itquite undermined my fond view of a loose and overreaching citronic belt,I found my actually monotonous way beguiled. Practically, till I reachedCharleston, this way, disclaiming every invidious intent, refused to bedissociated from anything else in the world: it was only another case ofthe painting with a big brush, a brush steeped in crude universal white,and of the colossal size this implement was capable of assuming.Gradations, transitions, differences of any sort, temporal, material,social, whether in man or in his environment, shrank somehow, under itssweep, to negligible items; and one had perhaps never yet seemed so tomove through a vast simplified scheme. The illustration was once more,in fine, of the small inherent, the small accumulated resistance, inAmerican air, to any force that does simplify. One found the signs ofsuch resistance as little in the prospect enjoyed from the car-window asone distinguished them in the vain images of the interior; those humandocuments, deciphered from ones seat in the Pullman, which yet doalways, in _their_ way, for the traveller, constitute precious evidence.The spread of this single great wash of winter from latitude to latitudestruck me in fact as having its analogy in the vast vogue of someinfinitely-selling novel, one of those happy volumes of which thecirculation roars, periodically, from Atlantic to Pacific and from greatwindy State to State, in the manner, as I have heard it vividly put, ofa blazing prairie fire; with as little possibility of arrest fromcriticism in the one case as from the bleating of lost sheep in theother. Everything, so to speak, was monotonized, and the whole socialorder might have had its nose, for the time, buried, by one levellingdoom, in the pages that, after the break of the spell, it would neverknow itself to mention again. Of course, one remembered meanwhile, therewere spells and spells, and the free fieldthe particular freedom ofwhich is the point of my remarkwould on occasion be just as open to thefar-exhaled breath of the South. That in fact is what I was to finditthough I thought all delightfullylater in the season, when thefreedom of the field struck me as pure benefit. I was not, at the end ofFebruary, really to meet it (as I had looked for it) before crossing theFlorida line; but toward the middle of June I was to meet it,enchantingly, at Baltimore, and this, then, as I had not stopped therein my previous course, was, even beyond the wondrous February Florida,to reveal to me, grateful for any such favour, the South in herfreshness. The freshness was in part, no doubtand even perhaps toextravagancemine; I testify at all events first for Baltimore.It would probably be again the freshness, of this confessedly subjectivesort, it would probably be again the state of alert response to anyfavour of the class just hinted at; but the immediate effect of theMaryland capital was to place it, to my troubled vision, and quite atthe head of its group, in a category of images and memories small at thebest and the charm of which casts a shadow, none the less, even as therose wears a thorn. I refer indeed in this slightly portentous figure tothe mere familiar truth that if representative values and the traceableor the imaginable connections of things happen to have, on occasion, foryour eyes and your intelligence, an existence of any intensity, yourcase, as a traveller, an observer, a reporter, is bound from thefirst, under the stirred impression, to loom for you in some distressfulshape. These representative values and constructive connections, thewhole of the latent vividness of things, not only remain, underexpression, subject to no definite chemical test, no mathematical proofwhatever, but almost turn their charming backs and toss their wilfulheads at ones poor little array of terms and equivalents. There thusimmediately rises for the lone visionary, betrayed and arrested in thevery act of vision, that spectre of impotence which dogs the footstepsof perception and whose presence is like some poison-drop in the silvercup. Baltimore put on for me, from the first glance, the form of thesilver cup filled with the mildest, sweetest decoction; but I had nosooner begun to taste of it than I began to taste also of the infusedbitter. It had, in its way, during that first early hour or two of thesummer evening, a perfect felicity: which meant, for the touchedintelligence, that it was full of pleasantly-playing reference andreflection, that it exhaled on the spot, as the word goes, anatmosphere; that it wore, to contemplation, in fine, a character asmarked with mild accents as some faded old uniform is marked withtarnished buttons and braidalbeit these sources of interest were tooclosely of the texture to be snipped off, in the guise of patterns orrelics, by any mere sharp shears of journalism.I arrived late in the day, and the day had been lovely; I alighted at alarge fresh peaceful hostelry, imposingly modern yet quietly affable,and, having recognized the deep, soft general note, even from mywindows, as that of a kind of mollified vivacity, I sought the streetswith as many tacit questions as I judged they would tolerate, or as thewaning day would allow me to put. It took but that hour, as I strolledin the early eventide, to give me the sense of the predicament I haveglanced at; that of finding myself committed to the view of Baltimore asquite insidiously sympathetic, quite inordinately amiablewhichamounted, in other words, to the momentous proposition that she wasinterestingand still of wondering, by the same stroke, how I was tomake any such statement plausible. Character is founded on elements andfeatures, so many particular parts which conduce to an expression. So Iwalked about the dear little city looking for the particular partsallwith the singular effect of rather failing to find them and with myimpression of felicity at the same time persistently growing. Thefelicity was certainly not that of a mere blank; there must accordinglyhave been items and objects, signs and tokens, there must have beencauses of so charming a consequence; there must have been the littlenumbers (not necessarily big, if only a tall enough column) for thecareful sum on my slate. What happened then, remarkably, was that whileI mechanically so argued my impression was fixing itself by a wild logicof its own, and that I was presently to see how it would, when oncesettled to a certain intensity, snap its fingers at warrants anddocuments. If it was a question of a slate the slate was used, atschool, I remembered, for more than one purpose; so that mine, by mywalks end, instead of a show of neat ciphering, exhibited simply a bolddrawn imagewhich had the merit moreover of not being in the least acaricature. The moral of this was preciousthat of the fine impunitywith which, if one but had sensibility, the ciphering could be neglectedand in fact almost contemned: always, that is (and only) _with_ onesfiner wits about one. Without them one was at best, really, nowhereevenwith items by the thousand; so that the place became, quite adorably,a lesson in the use of that resource. It would be no good to ajournalistfor _he_ is nowhere, ever, without his items; but it would beeverything, always, to the mere restless analyst. He might by its aidstand against all comers; and this alike in pleasure and in pain, in thebruised or in the soothed condition. That was the real way to workthings out, and to feel it so brought home would by itself sufficientlycrown this particular small pilgrimage.                                   IIIf my sensibility yielded so completely to Baltimore, however, I shouldadd, this was no doubt partly because the air seemed from the first tobreathe upon it a pledge of no bruises. I mounted, in the golden Junelight, the neatest, amplest, emptiest street-vista, the builded side ofa steepish hill, and, having come in due course to a spacious summit,laid out with monumental elegance and completely void, for the time, ofthe human footstep, I saw that to suffer in any fibre I should havepositively, somewhere, to hurl myself upon the spears. Not a pointprotruded then or afterwards; and the cunning of the restless analyst isessentially such that, with friction long enough in abeyance to leavehim a start, he is already astride of his happier thesis, seated firm,having elected to be undismountable, and riding it as hard as it willgo. The absence of friction, on my monumental hilltop and in theprospects it overhung, constituted, I was to find, an absolutecircus-ring for this exercise; and it is much to be able to say, whileperforming in the circus (even if but mainly to the public of ones ownconscience), that one has never had the sense of a safer hour. Thesafety of Baltimore, I should indeed mention, consisted perhaps a littleovermuch, during that first flush, in its apparently vacant condition:it affected me as a sort of perversely cheerful little city of the dead;and from the dead, naturally, comes no friction. Was it cheerful, thatis, or was it only resigned and discreet?with the manner of the goodbreeding that doesnt publicly prate of family troubles. I found myselfhandling, in imagination, these large quantities only because, as Isuppose, it was impossible not to remember on that spot of what nativegeneration one had come. It took no greater intensity of the South thanBaltimore could easily give to figure again, however fadedly, and all asa ghostly presence, the huge shadow of the War, and to reproduce thatparticular bloodstained patch of it which, in the very first days, thenow so irresponsible and absent community about me had flung across thepath of the North. This one echo of old Time made the connections, forthe instant, all vibrate, and the scene before me, somehow, as it stood,had to account for the great revolution. It was as if _that_, for therestless analyst, had to be disposed of before anything else: whereby,precisely, didnt the amenity of his impression partly spring from thedescent there, on the spot, in a quick white flash, of the most augustof the Muses? It was History in person that hovered, just long enoughfor me to recognize her and to read, in her strange deep eyes, _her_intelligence at least of everything. It might have been there fairly asreassurance. Yes, they have lived with _me_, and it has done them good,and we have buried together all their pastabout which, wise creature asI am, I allow them, of course, all piety. But thiswhat you make outaround usis their real collective self, which I am delighted to commendto you. Ive found Baltimore a charming patient. That was, in tenminutes, what it had come to; as if the brush of the sublime garment hadby itself cleared the air. If there was a fine warm hush everywhere itwas indeed partly that of this historic peace.But for the rest it only meant that the world was at such a season outof town. Houses were everywhere closed, and the neat perspectives, alldomiciliary and all, as I have hinted, tending mildly to a vagueelegance, were the more neat and more elegant, though doubtless also themore mild and the more vague, for their being so inanimate. A certainvividness of high decency seemed in spite of it to possess them, andthis suggestion of the real southern glow, yet with no southernlooseness, was clearly something by itselfall special and local andall, or almost all, expressed in repeated vistas of little brick-facedand protrusively door-stepped houses, which, overhung by tall, regularumbrage, suggested rows of quiet old ladies seated, with their toestucked-up on uniform footstools, under the shaded candlesticks ofold-fashioned tea-parties. The little ladylike squares, though below anytide-mark of fashion, were particularly frequent; in which case it wasas if the virtuous dames had drawn together round a large green table,albeit to no more riotous end than that each should sit before herindividual game of patience. One sounds inevitably the note of thevirtueso little, in general, can any picture of Americantown-appearance hang together without it. It amounts, everywhere, tosomething intenser than the implied absence of vice; it amounts to asort of registered absence of the conception or the imagination of it,and still more of the provision for it; though, all the while, as onegoes and comes, one feels that no community can really be as purged ofpeccant humours as the typical American has for the most part founditself foredoomed to look. It has been caught in the mechanism of thatconsistencyto an effect of convenience, doubtless, much more than toany other; and has thus, in the whole vast connection, a relation toappearances that is all its own. The European scene, at a thousandpoints, looks all its sophistications straight out at usor looks, inother words, at least as perverse as it practically is. The American, onthe other hand, expressing physiognomically no sophistications atallthough plenty of quite common candours, crudities andvulgaritiesmakes one ask if the cash-register, the ice-cream freezer,the lightning-elevator, the boys paper, and other such overflows, dotruly represent the sum of its passions. Incontestably, at all events,this immensely ingenuous aspect counts, for any country and any schemeof life, as a great force, just as the appearance of the stale and thecongested residing in the comparatively battered mask of experiencecounts as a weakness: to conceive which the minds eye has only to fix alittle the colossal American face grimacing with anything of a subtlerconsciousness. That image, if actually presented, would become, as wefeel, appalling. The inexorable fate of the countenance in question maybe so to learn to grimace in time, but though few processes are slow, inthe United States, and few exhibitions not contagious, any suchtransition, assuredly, will not be rapid, any more than any suchtendency will easily predominate.All of which would have carried me far from the simple sweetness ofBaltimore, were it not that, for the restless analyst, there is no suchthing as an unrelated fact, no such thing as a break in the chain ofrelations. Many a perceived American aspect, for that matter, would byitself have little to give; the student of manners, in other words, tomake it presentableby which I understand to make it _sufficiently_interestingmust first discover connections for it and then borrow fromthese, if possible, the elements of a wardrobe. And though it shouldsound a little monstrous, moreover, one had somehow not been preparedfor so delicate an effect of propriety; since there are cases too,indubitably, in which propriety can show for almost as coarse asanything else. It couldnt have been, either, that one had expected anypositive air of licence; but the fact was, I suppose, that, for aconstitutional story-seeker, a certain still, small shock, a prompt needof readjustment of view, was involved in ones finding the element ofthe bourgeois crop up, so inveterately, in latitudes generallyassociated, so far as one knew them elsewhere, with some perceptiblesacrifice to the sway of the senses. I had already, at this date, as Ihave noted, dipped deep into our own uttermost South, and had there hadto reckon with that first slight disconcertment awaiting the observerwhose southern categories happen to have been wholly European. Hissimplest expression for the anomaly he meets is that he sees thecitronic belt all incongruously Protestantized: that big word (for sosmall a bewilderment perhaps) sticks to him and worries himalmost asabsurdly, I grant, as if he had expected Charleston and Savannah tobetray the moral accent of Naples or Seville. He had not, assuredly,done this; but he had as little allowed, in imagination, for thehyperborean note. A South without church-fronts and church-interiors hadbeen superficially as strange, in its way, as a Methodism of thesub-tropic night, a Methodism of the orange and the palm. Such were thetreacheries of association; though what indeed would observation be, forinterest, if it were not, just by these armed surprises, constantlytouched with adventure? The beauty of Baltimore was, all this time, thatone could feel it as potentially harmonizing; the citronic belt wouldnot embrace here more Methodism than might consort with it, nor theMethodism pretend to cultivate with any success the hibiscus and thepomegranate.That I could entertain so many incoherent ideas in half-an-hour was inany case a proof that I felt, for the occasion, left in possession;quite as the visitor as yet unintroduced may feel during some longpreliminary wait in a drawing-room. He looks at the furniture, pictures,books; he studies in these objects the character of the house and of hishosts, and if there be some domestic treasure visibly more important andconspicuous than the others, it engages his attention as either with afatal or an engaging force. The top of the central eminence, with itsair of an ample plan and of sweeping the rest of the circle, figured thedocumentary parlour and my enjoyed leave to touch and examine; so thatwhen it was a question, in particular, of the monument to Washington,the high column, in the middle, with its surmounting figure and itsspreading architectural base, this presence was, for all the world, likethat of some vast and stately old-fashioned clock, a decorative piece,an heirloom from generations now respectably remote, occupying aninordinate space in proportion to the other conveniences. Theornamental, the important clock is apt to be in especial, at such acrisis, a tell-tale object; its range of testimony, of possibletreachery, is immense, and cases are not unknown, I gather, in which ithas put the doubting visitor to flight. The greater the felicity,thereby, for the overtopping Baltimore timepiece, which hung about inmild reassurance, promptly aware that it wasnt a bit vulgar, but, onthe contrary, of a pleasant jejune academic pomp that suggested to thefancy some melancholy, some spectral, man-at-arms mounting guard at theangles, in due military form, over suspected treasures of Style. Onecould imagine, somehow, under the summer stars, the mystic vigil ofthese mild heroes; and one could above all catch again the interestinghint of the terms on which, in the United States, the consecration oftime may be found operating. It has a trick there all of its own, thanksto which the effect of duration is produced very much as, before thefootlights, the prestidigitator produces the effect of extracting a livefowl from a hat. This is a law under which, the material permitting, thedecades count as centuries and the centuries as ons. The misfortune isthat too often the material, futile and treacherous, doesnt permit. Yetthe law is in the happiest cases none the less strikingly vindicated.There, for instanceto pursue undiscouraged my figure of the guest inthe empty parlourwere the best houses, the older, the ampler, the moreblandly quadrilateral; which in spite of their still faces met onesarrest, at their commodious corners and other places of vantage, with anunmistakable _manner_. The quiet assurance of a position in theworldthe world, the only one, with which they were concernedtestifiedagain, in an interesting way, to the simple source of theirimpressiveness, showing how almost any modern interval could have beenlong enough to make them nobly antique if such interval might only havebeen vulgar enough. The age of brown stone was to have found nodifficulty in _that_; the prolongation of its rage for a quarter of acentury amply sufficed to dignify every antecedent thing it had spared(as the survivors of reigns of Terror grow by mere survivaldistinguished); while, steeped in dishonour up to the eyebrows, that isup to its false cornices of painted and sanded wood and iron, it wasnever to enjoy, for itself, the advantage it elsewhere conferred.Nothing has ever been vulgar enough to rehabilitate the odd ugliness, sodistinct, yet after all so undemonstrable, of this luckless material;the way one shuddered, in particular, at the touch, on balustrade andelsewhere, of the sanded iron! It has been followed by other rages andother errors, but even the grace of the American time-measure can donothing for it.                                  IIIIt was of course the fact that the values here were all such, and suchalone, as might be reflected from the social conditions and the state ofmanners, even if reflected, for the hour, almost into empty spaceit wasthis that gave weight to each perceived appearance and permitted none toshow as trivial enough to project me, in reaction or in inanition, uponthe comparative obviousness of the burnt district. There is almostalways a burnt district to eke out the interest of an American cityitis the pride of the citizen and the resource of the visitor when allelse fails; and I can scarce, I think, praise Baltimore so liberally asto note that this was the last of her beauties I was conscious of. Shehad lost by fire, a few months before, the greater part of her businessquarter, which she was now rapidly and artfully calling back toexistence; but the entertainment she offered me was guiltless, ever sogracefully and gallantly guiltless, as it struck me, of reference, evenindirect, to the majesty either of ruin or of remedy. One was, onfurther acquaintance, thoroughly beguiled, but the burnt district had solittle to do with it that the days came and went without my so much asdiscovering its whereabouts. Wonderful little Baltimore, in which,whether when perched on a noble eminence or passing from one seat of thehumanities, one seat of hospitality, to anothera process mainlyconsisting indeed, as it seemed to me, of prompt drives through romanticparks and woodlands that were all suburban yet all ArcadianI caught noglimpse of traffic, however mild, nor spied anything tall at the endof any vista. This was in itself really a benediction, since I hadnowhere, from the first, been infatuated with tallness; I was infatuatedonly with the question of manners, in their largest senseto the fineressence of which tallness had already defined itself to me as positivelyabhorrent. What occurred betimes, and ever so happily, was simply thatthe delicate blank of those first hours flushed into animation, and thatwith this indeed the embroidery of the fine canvas turned thick andrich. It came back again, no doubt, in the inveterate way, to theUniversity presence, and to the eagerness with which, on the Americanscene, as I tire not, you see, of repeating, the visiting spirit, onsuch occasions, throws itself straight into sanctuary. It breaks in atany cost, this distracted appetite, and, recomposing the elements totheir greater distinction, if need be, and with a high imaginative hand,makes of the combination obtained the only firm standpoint for the restof the view. It has even in this connection an occasional sharp chill;air-borne rumours reach it of perversities and treacheries, conspiraciespossibly hatching in the very bosom of the temple and against its veryfaith. One hears of the University idea threatened in more than one ofthe great institutionsreduced to some pettifogging conception of ashort brisk term and a simplified culture; a lively thrifty training forbusiness-competition. This is a blow to the collective fond fanciesset humming, at once, in almost any scholastic shadeunder the effect ofwhich one can but give ones own scant scholars hood, while one winces,a further protesting pull over abashed brows. It would have been aquestion, very much, of what I call breaking-in (into the Johns Hopkins)at this moment, had I not here been indulged, in all liberality, with animpression the more charming, in a manner, for the fact of halls andcourts brooding in vacation stillness. Perversely adorable alwaysand Iscarce know whythe late afternoon light in deserted haunts of study;with the secret of supreme dignity lurking, above all, in high, dusky,wainscoted chambers where the sound of ones footfall lingers, to onespleasure, like a caress, and where portraits of the appurtenantworthies, the heroes and patrons, grow vague in the twilight. It is atribute to the forces of idealism lurking again and again, over thecountry, in the amenity of the general Collegiate appearance, that thelast thing these conditions overtly suggest, or seem to accept as theirimputed virtue, is this precipitation of the young intelligence into themere vociferous market.I scarcely know why, however, I should have appeared, even by waving itaway, to make room at our banquet for the possible skeleton of thefalse, the barbarizing, note; since the natural pitch of Baltimore, thepictorial, so to speak, as well as the social, struck me, once a certaincontact established, as that of disinterested sensibility, the passionof which her University is the highest and clearest example. There wason the splendid Sunday in particular a warm, soft fusion of aspectsa_con_fusion, in fact, while I now gather it inwhich seems to defy,though all unconsciously, the sharper edge of discrimination and tooffer itself, insistently, as a general wash of brave Southern shade,the play of a liquid brush of which the North knows nothing. Theepisodes melt together, yet they also, under a little pressure, comehappily apart, and over the large sun-chequered picture the generousboughs hang heavy. Admirable I found them, the Maryland boughs, and soimmediately disposed about the fortunate town, by parkside and lonelylane, by trackless hillside and tangled copse, that the depth of ruraleffect becomes at once bewildering. You wonder at the absenttransitions, you look in vain for the shabby fringesor at least, undermy spell, I did; you have never seen, on the lap of nature, so large aburden so neatly accommodated. Baltimore sits there as some quite robustbut almost unnaturally good child might sit on the green apron of itsnurse, with no concomitant crease or crumple, no uncontrollable mess,by the nursery term, to betray its temper. It was with something likethat figure before me that I kept communing, as I say, with the blandpresence. Even a morning hour or two at the great UniversityHospitalfor ones experience of the higher tone, ones irrepressiblepursuit of charm, in America, has, to its great enrichment, these oddsequenceseven that beginning of the day did nothing to obtrude the uglyor to overemphasize the real; it simply contributed, under someperversion that I can neither explain nor defend, to the general graceof the picture. Why should the great Hospital, with its endless chambersof woe, its whole air as of _most_ directly and advisedly facing, as thehospitals of the world go, the question of the immensities of painwhyshould such an impression actually have turned, under the spell, to finepoetry, to a mere shining vision of the conditions, the high beauty ofapplied science? The conditions, positively, as I think of them afterthe interval, make the poetrythe large art, above all, by which, in aplace bristling with its terrible tale, everything was made to seemfair, and fairest even while it most intimately concurred in the work.In short if the Hospital was fundamentally Universitarianas of thedomain of the great Medical Facultyso it partook for me, in its ownway, of the University glamour, and so the tempered morning, and theshaded splendour, and the passive rows, the grim human alignments thatbecame, in their cool vistas, delicate symphonies in white, and, moreeven than anything else, the pair of gallant young Doctors who ruled,for me, so gently, the whole still concert, abide with me, collectively,as agents of the higher tone.No example could speak more of that enlargement of function, forconstituting some picture of life, which many an American element orobject, many an institution, has to be felt as practisingusually withhigh success. It comes back, one notes for the thousandth time, to thatredistribution and reconsecration of values, of representative weight,which it is _the_ interesting thing, over the land, to see takeeffectto see in special take all the effect of which it is capable.There are a thousand European values that are absent, and, whether asa consequence or not of that, there are innumerable felt solutions ofthe social continuity. The instinct of missingby which I mean not atall either the consciousness or the confession of lackingkeeps up,however, its own activity; for the theory at least of the native spiritis to consent wittingly to no privation. It has a genius, the nativespirit, for desiring things of the existence, and even of thepossibility of which it is actually unaware, and it views the totalityof nature and the general life of man, I think, as more than anythingelse commissioned and privileged to wait on these awakenings. Thus newvalues arise as expansion proceeds; the marked character of which, forcomparative sociology, is that they are not at all as other values. Whatthey count for is the particular required American quantity; and wesee again and again how large a quantity symbol and figure have torepresent. The interesting thing is that, on the spot, therepresentation does practically cover the ground: it covers elementsthat in communities employing a different scale require for theirexpression (and perhaps sometimes to an effect of waste) a much greaternumber of terms. Hence the constant impression of elasticity, and thatof those pressures of necessity under which value and virtue, characterand quantity, greatness and glory even, to a considerable extent, areimputed and projected. There has to be a facility for the working of anysocial formfacility of comparison and selection in some communities,facility of rapid conversion in others That is where the Americanmaterial is elastic, where it affects one, as a whole, in the manner ofsome huge india-rubber cloth fashioned for field use and warranted tobear inordinate stretching.One becomes aware thus wherever one turns, both of the tension and ofthe resistance; everything and every one, all objects and elements, allsystems, arrangements, institutions, functions, persons, reputations,give the sense of their pulling hard at the india-rubber: almost always,wonderfully, without breaking it off, yet never quite with the effect ofcausing it to lie thick. The matter of interest, however, is just thisfact that its thinness should so generallyin some cases, to all intentsand purposes, so richlysuffice; suffice, that is, for producingunaided, impressions of a sort that make their way to us in Europethrough superimposed densities, a thousand thicknesses of tradition.Which is what one means, again, by the differing values; the thinnessdoing perforce, on the one side, much of the work done by the thicknesson the other: the work, in particular, of the appeal to the fondobserver. He is by his very nature committed everywhere to hisimpressionwhich means essentially, I think, that he is foredoomed, inone place as in another, to put in a certain quantity of emotion andreflection. The turn his sensibility takes depends of course on what isbefore him; but when is it ever not in some manner exposed and alert? Ifit be anything really of a touchstone it is more disposed, I hold, toeasy bargains than to hard ones; it only wants to be _somehow_interested, and is not without the knowledge that an emotion is afterall, at the best or the worst, but an emotion. All of which is avoluminous commentary, I admit, on the modest text that I perhaps madethe University Hospital stand for too many things. That establishes atall events my contentionthat the living fact, in the United States,_will_ stand, other facts not preventing, for almost anything you mayask of it. Other facts, at Baltimore, didnt preventthere being none,outside the University circle, of any perceptibly public, any majesticor impressive or competitive order. So it was as if this particularexperience had been (as the visitation of cities goes) that of _all_present art and organization, that of all antiquity, history, piety,sociability, that of the rich real and the rich romantic, in fine, at astroke. Had there been more to see and to feel I should possibly haveseen and felt more; yet what was absent, with this sense of feeling andseeing so much?                                   IVThere _were_ other facts, in abundance, I hasten to add; only theywere not, as I say, competitive, not of the public or majesticorderso that they the less imposed, for appreciation, anyrearrangement of values. They were a matter still of the famous, thefelicitous Sundayinto which as into an armful of the biggest andbravest June roses I seemed to find my perceptions cluster. Foremostamong these meanwhile was that of the plentiful presence, freshlyrecognized, of absolute values toowhich offer themselves, in themidst of the others, with a sharpness of their own, and which owenothing, for interest, to any question of the general scale. TheCountry Club, for instance, as I have already had occasion to note,is everywhere a clear American felicity; a _complete_ product of thesocial soil and air which alone have made it possible, and wearingwhenever met that assured face of the full-blown flower and theproved proposition. These institutions speak so of American life asa success that they affected me at moments as crying aloud to becommemoratedsince it is on American life only that they arefounded, and since they render it, to my mind, the good office ofmaking it keep all its graces and of having caused it to shed, bythe same stroke, the elements that are contrary to these. Nothing ismore suggestive than to recognize, each time, on the premises, thething that wouldnt do in Europefor a judgment of the reasons ofits doing so well in the one hemisphere and so ill in the otherpromptly becomes illuminating. The illumination is one at which, hadI space, I should have liked to light here a candle or twopartakingindeed by that character of a like baffled virtue in many anothergroup of social phenomena. The Country Club testifies, in short, andgives its evidence, from the box, with the inimitable, invaluableaccent of American authority. It becomes, for the restless analyst,one of the great garden-lamps in which the flame of Democracy burnswhitest and steadiest and most floods the subject; taking its placethus on the positive side of a line which has its other sideoverscored with negatives. I may seem too much to brood upon it, butthe interest of the American scene being, beyond any other, theshow, on so immense a scale, of what Democracy, pushing and breakingthe ice like an Arctic explorer, is making of things, any scrap thatcontributes to it wears a part of its dignity. To have beenbeforehand with the experiments, with several rather risky ones atleast, and to have got on with these so beautifully while otherrueful nations prowl, in the dusk, inquisitive but apprehensive,round the red windows of the laboratory, peeping, for the last news,between each others shouldersall this is, for the democraticforce, to have stolen a march over no little of the ground, and tohave gained time on such a scale as perhaps to make the belated ofthe earth, the critical group at the windows, still live to think ofthemselves as having too much wasted it.There had been oneI mean a blest Country Clubin the neighbourhood ofBoston (where indeed I believe there were a dozen, at least asexemplary, out of my range); there had been another, quite marvellous,on the Hudsonone of a numerous array, probably, within an hours run ofNew York; there had been a supreme specimen, supreme for a documentaryworth, even at Charleston (I reserve to myself to explain in due course,and ah, in such an exquisite sense, my even). This had made for me, ifyou will, a short list, but it had made a long admonition, to which theembowered institution near Baltimore was to add a wonderful emphasis. Anadmonition of what? it will meanwhile be asked: to which the answer mayperhaps, for the moment, not be more precipitate than by ones sayingthat with any feeling for American life you soon enough see. You see itsmost complete attestation of its believing in itself unlimitedly, andalso of its being right about itself at more points than it is wrong.You see it apply its general theory of its nature and strengthmuch ofthis doubtless quite an unconscious onewith a completeness and aconsistency that will strike you also (or that ought to) as constitutingan unconscious heroism. You will see it accept in detail, with a sublimeserenity, certain large social consequencesthe consequences of thestraight application, in the most delicate conditions, of the primedemocratic idea. As this idea is that of an universal eligibility, soyou see it, under the application, beautifully resist the strain. So yousee, in a word, everything staked on the conception of the young Familyas a clear social unitwhich, when all is said and done, remains,roundabout you, the ubiquitous fact. The conception of the Family is,goodness knows, European enough; but the difference resides in itsworking on one side of the world in the vertical and on the other in thehorizontal sense. If its identity in Europe, that is, resides moreespecially in its perpendicular, its backward and forward extension, itsascent and descent of the long ladder of time, so it develops in theUnited States mainly by its lateral spread, as one may say; expressingitself thus rather by number than by name, and yet taking itself forgranted, when one comes to compare, with an intensity to which merevirtue of name elsewhere scarce helps it. American manners, as theystand, register therefore the apotheosis of the Familya truth for whichthey have by no means received due credit; and it is in the light ofCountry Clubs that all this becomes vivid. These organizations acceptthe Family as the social unitaccept its extension, its _whole_extension, through social space, and accept it as many times over as thequestion comes up: which is what one means by their sublime andsuccessful consistency. No, if I may still insist, nothing anywhereaccepts anything as the American Country Club accepts these wholeextensions.That is why I speak of it as accepting the universal eligibility. Withno palpable result does the democratic idea, in the States, more bristlethan with the view that the younger are as good as the elder; familylife is in fact, as from child to parent, from sister to brother, fromwife to husband, from employed to employer, the eminent field of thedemocratic demonstration. This then is the unit that, with its latentmultiplications, the Country Club takes overand it is easy to see howsuch units must multiply. This is the material to which it addresses,with such effect, the secret of its power. I may of course be asked whatI mean by an eligibility that is universal; but it seems needless toremark that even the most inclusive social scheme must in a largecommunity always stop somewhere Distinctly diverting, often, toAmericans, the bewilderment of the European mind on the subject ofdifferences and of the practicability of precautions for maintainingthese; so beset is that mind, to the American view, with this theory,this habit or need of precautions, and so disposed apparently to fear,in its anxiety, that without the precautions the differencesdreadfulthoughtmay cease. The American theory is, I think, but vague, and theinevitable consciousness of differences reduced to a matter ofpracticea matter which, on the whole, very much takes care of itself.Glimpses and revelations come to it, across the sea, on the great waveof modern publicityimages of a social order in which the precautions,as from above to below, are more striking than the differences andthereby out of proportion to them: an appearance that reads a lesson, ofa sort, as to leaving precautions alone. It is true, at any rate, thatno application of the aristocratic, none of the democratic, idea is everpractically complete; discriminations are produced by the mere workingof the machine, and they so engage alike almost every ones interest,meet alike almost every ones convenience. Nature and industry keepproducing differences as fast as constitutions keep proclaimingequality, and there are always, at the best, in any really liberalscheme or human view, more conscious inaptitudes to convince of theirprivilege than conscious possibilities to remind of their limits. All ofwhich reflections, however, I agree, would probably have remained alittle dim even for the restless analyst, had not the most shining ofhis examples bathed the subject, to his eyes, in radiance. This couldonly be, as I have intimated, that of the bright institution on theHudson, as half-an-hours vision of it, one splendid Sunday of theMay-time put it before meall in terms so eloquent that I would fainhave translated them on the spot.For there, to every appearance, was the high perfection of the typetheample, spreading, galleried house, hanging over the great river, withits beautiful largeness of provision for associated pleasures. TheAmerican note was _there_in the intensity and continuity of theassociation, and the interest of the case was in its thus enjoying, forthe effect, all the advantages that experience, chastening experience,and taste, real taste, could heap upon it. Somewhere in ones mind,doubtless, lurked the apprehension that such a proposition might, inthat emphatic form, have betrayed a thousand flawswhereas all one_could_ say face to face with it, treading its great verandahs andconversation-rooms, its halls of refreshment, repose and exercise, itskitchens and its courts and its baths and its gardens, its wondrousinside and outside palstra, was that it positively revealed new formsof felicity. It was thus a new and original thingrare phenomenonandactually an important one; for what did it represent (alldiscriminations made and recognized) but the active Family, as a finalsocial fact, or in other words the sovereign People, as a pervasive andpenetrative mass, doing themselves on unprecedented lines? They hadinvoked, certainly, high and congruous countenance; but vain I thoughtthe objection made when I exclaimed to a friend on these marvels. Itdepends upon whom I call the People? Of course it depends: so I callthem, exactly, the groups and figures we see, here before us, enjoying,and enjoying both so expertly and so discreetly, these conveniences andluxuries. Thats their interestthat they _are_ the people; for whatinterest, under the sun, would they have if they werent? They are thepeople arrived, and, what is more, disembarked: thats all thedifference. It seems a difference because elsewhere (in Europe, sayagain), though we see them begin, at the very most, to arrive, socially,we yet practically see them still on the shipwe have never yet seenthem disembark thus _en masse_. This is the effect they have when, allimpediments and objections on the dock removed, they do _that_. Andlater on, at the afternoons end, on the platform of the large agreeableriverside station which spread there, close at hand, as the appanage ofthe club itself, I could but call attention to the manner in which everyimpression reinforced my moral. The Families, the parties, the groupsand couples (the element of the Individual, as distinguished from thatof the Family, being remarkably absent) had gathered in the softeventide for the return to New York, and it was impossible not to readeach sign of the show in the vivid popular light. Only one did soandthis was the great pointwith a positive uplifting of the spirit.Everything hung together and every one was charming. It was myexplanatory word therefore to my companion. Thats what the People_are_ when theyve disembarked.Having said so muchand with the sense, strange as it may appear, thatthere would still be much to sayI must add that I suddenly seem to seeconsternation in the charming face of the establishment, deep in theBaltimore countryside, my impression of which was to lay a train forthese reflections: so that with a conscience less clear I might take theimage as a warning against the vice of reading too much meaning intosimple intentions. Therefore let me admit that the conscious purpose ofthis house of hospitality didnt look beyond the immediate effect ofluncheon or dinner on one of its deep southern verandahs, with greattrees, close at hand, flinging their shade, with the old garden of theold country home that the Club had inherited forming one prospect, andwith a deep woodland valley, stream-haunted if I am not mistaken, givingbreadth of style to another. The Maryland boughs, for that matter,creating in the upper air great classic serenities of shade, givebreadth of style; and the restless analyst, all grateful, and truly forthe nonce at rest, could but ruefully note how little they had borrowedfrom any Northern, and least of all from any New England, model theiralmost academic grace. They might have borrowed it straight fromfar-away Claudes and Turners; yet one made no point of that eithertheirinterest was so sufficiently their own. Distances of view have often inthe North the large elegance, but nearnesses almost never; these are attheir worst constitutionally coarse and at their best merelywell-meaning. I was to find food all day for that observation; I was toremain under a charm of which breadth of style was the key. Earth andair, between them, had taken it in handso that one was always moving,somehow, under arches that were triumphal or sitting in bowers thatmade one think of temples. It was not that man, or that art, had donemuch, though indeed they had incurred no shame and had even been capableof a masterpiece, seen in the waning light, of which I shall presentlyspeak. It was the diffused, mitigated glow, the happy medium itself thatcontinued to be meanwhile half the picture. I wandered through it fromone impression to another, and I keep, with intensity, that of theadmirable outlying Park, treasure of the town, through which I hadalready three or four times driven, but the holiday life of which, onthe warm Sunday night, humming, languidly, under the stars, as withspent voices of the homeward-bound, attested more than ever its valuablefunction.That must have been, in the whole pleasant incoherence, on my way backfrom the sweet old Carroll house, climax of an afternoon drive, yetbefore another, an ultimate visit, which was the climax of everything. Ihave sufficiently noted already the charming law under which, in theStates, any approach to really ripe architectural charmfor the realripeness is indispensableenjoys advantages, those of mystery andsanctity, that are achieved in Europe but on greatly harder terms. Theobserved practice of this art, at times singularly subtle, is in facthalf the reward of ones attention, puzzled though the latter may nonethe less be to see how the trick is played. So much at any rate oneremembers; yet where, after all, would the sweet old Carroll house,nestling under its wood in the late June afternoon, and with somethingvaguely haunted in its lonely refinement, not have made an insidiousappeal? There are sweet old Carroll houses, I believe, on several othersitesthe luckiest form perhaps in which a flourishing family may havebeen moved to write its annals. The intimation of annals hangs aboutthe place, and again we try to capture, under the charming pillaredportico, before the mild red brick and the pale pediment and facings, inthe series of high chambers, quite instinct with style (small far-offcousins of such apartments, say, as those of Kensington Palace, thoughthey cover, bungalow-fashion, scarce more than one floor), somelingering, living accents of such a profession of history. We captureverily, I think, nothing; we merely project a little, from one room andfrom one mild aspect of the void to another, our old habit ofsuppositions. Bred of other historic contacts, it instinctively putsforth feelers; but the feelers drop, after a little, like hands thatmeet nothing; our suppositions themselves, as I have called them, andwhich but return to us like toy ships that wont sail, are all they findtangible. There is satisfaction of a sort, however, even in sucharrested questions, when, as before this delicate faintly-resonantshell, each other element also helping, they have been vividly enoughsuggested. Later on, for the real crown of my day, no wonderments werechecked and no satisfactions imperfect. Attained, for the high finish ofthe evening, by another plunge, behind vaguely-playing carriage-lamps,into the bosky, odorous, quite ridiculously-romantic suburban night,this was the case of an ancient home without lapses or breaks, where thepast and the present were in friendliest fusion, so that the waitingfuture evidently slumbered with confidence; and where, above the easyopen-air Southern hospitality, an impression now of shafts of mildcandle-light across overlaced outer galleries and of throbs of naturesvoice in the dark vaster circle, the Maryland boughs, at their best,presided in the unforgettable grand manner.                                   XI                               WASHINGTON                                   II was twice in Washington, the first time for a winter visit, the secondto meet the wonderful advance of summer, to which, in that climate ofmany charms, the first days of May open wide the gates. This latterimpression was perforce much the more briefly taken; yet, though I hadgathered also from other past occasions, far-away years now, somethingof the sense of the place at the earlier season, I find everythingwashed over, at the mention of the name, by the rare light, half green,half golden, of the lovely leafy moment. I see all the rest, till I makethe effort to break the spell, through that voluminous veil; whichoperates, for memory, quite as the explosion of spring works, even tothe near vision, in respect to the American scene at largedressing itup as if for company, preparing it for social, for human intercourse,making it in fine publicly presentable, with an energy of renewal and aneffect of redemption not often to be noted, I imagine, on othercontinents. Nowhere, truly, can summer have such work cut out for it asherenowhere has it to take upon itself to repaint the picture socompletely. In the European landscape, in general, some, at least, ofthe elements and objects remain upon the canvas; here, on the otherhand, one seems to see intending Nature, the great artist of the season,decline to touch that surface unless it be first swept cleandecline, atany rate, to deal with it save by ignoring all its perceivedpretensions. Vernal Nature, in England, in France, in Italy, has still ause, often a charmed or amused indulgence, for the material in hand, thefurniture of the foreground, the near and middle distances, theheterogeneous human features of the face of the land. She looks at hersubject much as the portrait-painter looks at the personal properties,this or that household object, the official uniform, the badges andornaments, the favourite dress, of his sitterwith an Oh, yes, I canbring them in; theyre just what I want, and I see how they will help meout. But I try in vain to recall a case in which, either during the NewEngland May and June, or during those of the Middle States (since thesegroups of weeks have in the two regions a differing identity and value),the genius in question struck me as adopting with any frankness, asdoing more than passively, helplessly accept, the suppliedparaphernalia, the signs of existing life. The business is clearly toget rid of them as far as may be, to cover and smother them;dissimulating with the biggest, freest brush their impertinence andtheir ugliness.I must ask myself, I meanwhile recognize, none the less, why I shouldhave found Mount Vernon exquisite, the first of May, if the interest hadall to be accounted for in the light of nature. The light of nature wasthere, splendid and serene; the Potomac opened out in its grandestmanner; the bluff above the river, before the sweep of its horizon,raised its head for the historic crown. But it was not for a moment tobe said that this was the whole story; the human interest and the humancharm lay in wait and held one fastso that, if one had been makinglight, elsewhere, of their suggestion and office, one had at least thiscase seriously to reckon with. I speak straightway, thus, of MountVernon, though it be but an outlying feature of Washington, and at thebest a minor impression; the image of the particular occasion is seatedso softly in my path. There was a glamour, in fine, for theexcursionthat of an extraordinarily gracious hospitality; and theglamour would still have been great even if I had not, on my return tothe shadow of the Capitol, found the whole place transfigured. Theseason was over, the President away, the two Houses up, the shuttersclosed, the visitor rare; and one lost ones way in the great greenvistas of the avenues quite as one might have lost it in a sylvansolitudethat is in the empty alleys of a park. The emptiness wasqualified at the most, here and there, by some encounter with a straydiplomatic agent, wreathed for the most part in sincerer smiles than weare wont to attribute to his class. Thisit was the meaning of theseinflectionswas the _real_ Washington, a place of enchantment; so thatif the enchantment were never less who could ever bring himself to goaway? The enchantment had been so much less in Januaryone could easilyunderstand; yet the recognition seemed truly the voice of the hour, andone picked it up with a patriotic flutter not diminished by the factthat the speaker would probably be going away, and with delight, on themorrow.The memory of some of the smiles and inflections comes back in thatlight; Washington being the one place in America, I think, where thosequalities are the values and vehicles, the medium of exchange. No smallpart of the interest of the social scene there consists, inevitably, forany restless analyst, in wonder about the real sentiments of appointedforeign participants, the delegates of Powers and pledged alike topenetration and to discretion, before phenomena which, whatever they maybe, differ more from the phenomena of other capitals and other societiesthan they resemble them. This interest is susceptible, on occasion, ofbecoming intense; all the more that curiosity must, for the most part,pursue its object (that of truly looking over the alien shoulder and ofseeing, judging, building, fearing, reporting with the alien sense) bysubtle and tortuous ways. This represents, first and last, even for awatcher abjectly irresponsible, a good deal of speculative tension; sothat ones case is refreshing in presence of the clear candour of such aproposition as that the national capital _is_ charming in proportion asyou dont see it. For that is what it came to, in the bowery condition;the as yet unsurmounted bourgeois character of the whole was screenedand disguised; the dressing-up, in other words, was complete, and thegreat park-aspect gained, and became nobly artificial, by the verycomplexity of the plan of the placethe perpetual perspectives, theconverging, radiating avenues, the frequent circles and crossways, whereall that was wanted for full illusion was that the bronze generals andadmirals, on their named pedestals, should have been great garden-gods,mossy mythological marble. This would have been the perfect note; thelong vistas yearned for it, and the golden chequers scattered throughthe gaps of the high arches waited for some bending nymph or somearmless Hermes to pick them up. The power of the scene to evoke suchvisions sufficiently shows, I think, what had become, under the mercy ofnature, of the hard facts, as one must everywhere call them; and yetthough I could, diplomatically, patriotically pretend, at the rightmoment, that such a Washington was the real one, my assent had all thewhile a still finer meaning for myself.I am hanging back, however, as with a sacred terror, from Mount Vernon,where indeed I may not much linger, or only enough to appear not to haveshirked the responsibility incurred at the opening of these remarks.There, in ample possession, was masking, dissimulating summer, theenvelope and disguise to which I have hinted that the American pictureowes, on its human side, _all_ its best presentability; and at the sametime, unmistakably, there was the spell, as quite a distinct matter, ofthe hard little facts in themselves. How came it that if they couldthrow a spell they were yet so abject and so negligible? How came itthat if they had no intrinsic sweetness, no visible dignity, they couldyet play their part in so unforgettable an impression? The answer tothis can only be, I think, that we happen here to strike, as they say,one of the rarest of cases, a spot on which all sorts of sensibilitiesare touched and on which a lively emotion, and one yet other than thesthetic, makes us its prey. The old high-placed house, unquestionably,is charming, and the felicity of the whole scene, on such a day as thatof my impression, scarce to be uttered. The little hard facts, facts ofform, of substance, of scale, facts of essential humility and exiguity,none the less, look us straight in the face, present themselvesliterally to be counted overand reduce us thereby to the recognition ofour supreme example of the rich interference of association. Associationdoes, at Mount Vernon, simply what it likes with usit is of sobeautiful and noble a sort; and to this end it begins by making us unfitto say whether or no we would in its absence have noticed the house forany material grace at all. We scarce care more for its being provedpicturesque, the house, than for its being proved plain; itsarchitectural interest and architectural nullity become one and the samething for us. If asked what we should think of it if it hadnt been, orif we hadnt known it for, Washingtons, we retort that the inquiry isinane, since it is not the possessive case, but the straight, serenenominative, that we are dealing with. The whole thing _is_Washingtonnot his invention and his property, but his presence and hisperson; with discriminations (as distinguished from enthusiasms) asinvidious and unthinkable as if they were addressed to his very ears.The great soft fact, as opposed to the little hard ones, is the beautyof the site itself; that is definitely, if ever so delicately, sublime,but it fails to rank among the artificial items that I began by speakingof, those of so generally compromising an effect in the Americanpicture. Everything else is _communicated_ importance, and the magic sowrought for the American sensibilityby which I mean the degree of theimportance and the sustained high pitch of the charmplace it,doubtless, the world over, among the few supreme triumphs of suchcommunication. The beauty of the site, meanwhile, as we stand there,becomes but the final aspect of the man; under which everything conducesto a single great representative image, under which every feature of thescene, every object in the house, however trivial, borrows from it andprofits by it. The image is the largest, clearest possible of theresting, as distinguished from the restless, consciousness of publicservice consummately rendered. The terms we commonly use for thatconditionpeace with honour, well-earned repose, enjoyment of homage,recognition of factsrender but dimly the luminous stillness in which,on its commanding eminence, we see our image bathed. It hangs togetherwith the whole bright immensity of air and view. It becomes truly thegreat white, decent page on which the whole sense of the place iswritten. It does more things even besides; attends us while we moveabout and goes with us from room to room; mounts with us the narrowstairs, to stand with us in these small chambers and look out of the lowwindows; takes up for us, to turn them over with spiritual hands, theobjects from which we respectfully forbear, and places an accent, inshort, through the rambling old phrase, wherever an accent is required.Thus we arrive at the full meaning, as it werethus we know, at least,why we are so moved.It is for the same reason for which we are always inordinately moved, onAmerican ground, I think, when the unconscious minor scale of the littleold demonstrations to which we owe everything is made visible to us,when their disproportionate modesty is proved upon them. The reasonworked at Mount Vernon, for the restless analyst, quite as it had workeda few months before, on the small and simple scene of Concord Fight: theslight, pale, bleeding Past, in a patched homespun suit, stands theretaking the thanks of the bloated Presenthaving woundedly rescued fromthieves and brought to his door the fat, locked pocket-book of whichthat personage appears the owner. The pocket-book contains, unbeknownto the honest youth, bank-notes of incredible figure, and what breaksour heart, if we be cursed with the historic imagination, is thegrateful, wan smile with which the great guerdon of sixpence isreceived. I risk, floridly, the assertion that half the intensity of theimpression of Mount Vernon, for many a visitor, will ever be in thisvision there of Washington _only_ (so far as consciously) so rewarded.Such fantastications, I indeed admit, are refinements of response to anyimpression, but the ground had been cleared for them, and it ministeredto luxury of thought, for instance, that we were a small party at ourease there, with no other circulationwith the prowling ghosts offellow-pilgrims, too harshly present on my previous occasion, allconveniently laid. This alone represented privilege and power, and theyin turn, with their pomp and circumstance of a charming Governmentlaunch, under official attendance, at the Navy-Yard steps, amid thoselarge, clean, protecting and protected properties of the State whichalways make one think much of the State, whatever its actualinfirmitiesthese things, to say nothing of other rich enhancements,above all those that I may least specify, flung over the day I scarceknow what iridescent reflection of the star-spangled banner itself, inthe folds of which I had never come so near the sense of beingpositively wrapped. That consciousness, so unfamiliar, was, under thetest, irresistible; it pressed the spring, absolutely, of intellectualexaltationwith the consequent loud resonance that my account of myimpressions doubtless sufficiently translates.                                   IIWashington itself meanwhilethe Washington always, I premise, of therank outsiderhad struck me from the first as presenting two distinctfaces; the more obvious of which was the public and official, themonumental, with features all more or less majestically playing thegreat administrative, or, as we nowadays put it, Imperial part. Thisclustered, yet at the same time oddly scattered, city, a generalimpression of high granite steps, of light grey corniced colonnades,rather harmoniously low, contending for effect with slaty mansard roofsand masses of iron excrescence, a general impression of somewhat vague,empty, sketchy, fundamentals, however expectant, however spacious,overweighted by a single Dome and overaccented by a single Shaftthisloose congregation of values seemed, strangely, a matter disconnectedand remote, though remaining in its way portentous and bristling allincoherently at the back of the scene. The back of the scene, indeed, toones quite primary sense, might have been but an immense painted, yetunfinished cloth, hung there to a confessedly provisional end and markedwith the queerness, among many queernesses, of looking always the same;painted once for all in clear, bright, fresh tones, but never emergingfrom its flatness, after the fashion of other capitals, into the truly,the variously, modelled and rounded state. (It appeared provisionaltherefore because looking as if it might have been unhooked and removedas a whole; because any one object in it so treated would have made therest also come off.) The foreground was a different thing, a thing that,ever so quaintly, seemed to represent the force really in possession;though consisting but of a small company of people engaged perpetuallyin conversation and (always, I repeat, for the rank outsider) singularlydestitute of conspicuous marks or badges. This little society easilybecame, for the detached visitor, the city itself, _the_ nationalcapital and the greater part of the story; and that, ever, in spite ofthe comparatively scant intensity of its political permeation. Thepolitical echo was of course to be heard in it, and the publiccharacter, in his higher forms, to be encounteredthough only in singlespies, not in battalions; but there was something that made it muchmore individual than any mere predominance of political oradministrative colour would have made it; leaving it in that case to dono more than resemble the best society in London, or that in bestpossession of the field in Paris.Two sharp signs my remoter remembrance had shown me the then Washingtonworld, and the first met, as putting forth; one of these the fact of itsbeing extraordinarily easy and pleasant, and the other that of onesappearing to make out in it not more than half-a-dozen members of theLower House and not more than a dozen of the Upper. This kept down thepolitical permeation, and was bewildering, if one was able to compare,in the light of the different London condition, the fact of the socialubiquity there of the acceptable M.P. and that of the social frequencyeven of his more equivocal hereditary colleague. A London nestling underthe towers of Westminster, yet practically void of members of the Houseof Commons, and with the note of official life far from exclusivelysounding, that might have been in those days the odd image ofWashington, had not the picture been stamped with other variationsstill. These were a whole cluster, not instantly to be made out, butconstituting the unity of the place as soon as perceived; representingthat finer extract or essence which the self-respecting observer isnever easy till he be able to shake up and down in bottled form. Thecharming company of the foreground then, which referred itself so littleto the sketchy back-scene, the monstrous Dome and Shaft, figments of theupper air, the pale colonnades and mere myriad-windowed Buildings, wasthe second of the two faces, and the more one lived with it the more, upto a certain point, one lived away from the first. In time, and afterperceiving _how_ it was what it so agreeably was, came the recognitionof common ground; the recognition that, in spite of strange passages ofthe national life, liable possibly to recur, during which the Presidenthimself was scarce thought to be in society, the particular preciouscharacter that one had apprehended could never have ripened without ageneral consensus. One had put ones finger on it when one had seendisengage itself from many anomalies, from not a few drolleries, thesuperior, the quite majestic fact of the City of Conversation pure andsimple, and positively of the only specimen, of any such intensity, inthe world.That had remained for me, from the other time, the properest name ofWashington, and nothing could so interest me, on a renewal ofacquaintance, too long postponed and then too woefully brief, as to findmy description wholly justified. If the emphasis added by pure andsimple be invariably retained, the description will continue, I think,to embrace and exhaust the spectacle, while yet leaving it every inch ofits value. Clearly quite immeasurable, on American ground, the value ofsuch an assertion of a town-type directly opposed to the unvaryingAmerican, and quite unique, on any ground, so organized a socialindifference to the vulgar vociferous Market. Washington may of course_know_ more than she confessesno community could perhaps really be asignorant as Washington used at any rate to look, and to like to look, ofthis particular thing, of goods and shares and rises and falls and allsuch sordidities; but she knows assuredly still the very least she canget off with, and nothing even yet pleases her more than to forget whatshe does know. She unlearns, she turns her back, while London, Paris,Berlin, Rome, in their character of political centres, strike us as, onthe contrary, feverishly learning, trying more and more to do the exactopposite. (I speak, naturally, as to Washington, of knowing actively andinterestedly, in the spirit of gainnot merely of the enjoyed lights ofpolitical and administrative science, doubtless as abundant there asanywhere else.) It might fairly have been, I used to think, that thecharming placecharming in the particular connection I speak ofhad onits conscience to make one forget for an hour the colossal greed of NewYork. Nothing, in fact, added more to its charm than its appearingvirtually to invite one to impute to it some such vicarious compunction.If I be reminded, indeed, that the distinction I here glance at isnegative, and be asked what then (if she knew nothing of the greatAmerican interest) Washington did socially know, my answer, I recognize,has at once to narrow itself, and becomes perhaps truly the least bitdifficult to utter. It none the less remains distinct enough that, theCity of Conversation being only in question, and a general subject ofall the conversation having thereby to be predicated, our responsibilityis met as soon as we are able to say what Washington mainly talks, andappears always to go mainly talking, about. Washington talks aboutherself, and about almost nothing else; falling superficially indeed, onthat ground, but into line with the other capitals. London, Paris,Berlin, Rome, goodness knows, talk about themselves: that is each memberof this sisterhood talks, sufficiently or inordinately, of the greatnumber of divided and differing selves that form together hercontrolling identity. London, for instance, talks of everything in theworld without thereby for a moment, as it were, ceasing to beegotistical. It has taken everything in the world to make London up, sothat she is in consequence simply doomed never to get away from herself.Her conversation is largely, I think, the very effort to do that; butshe inevitably figures in it but as some big buzzing insect which keepsbumping against a treacherous mirror. It is in positive quest of anidentity of some sort, much ratheran identity other than merelyfunctional and technicalthat Washington goes forth, encumbered with noideal of avoidance or escape: it is about herself _as_ the City ofConversation precisely that she incessantly converses; adorning thetopic, moreover, with endless ingenuity and humour. But that,absolutely, remains the case; which thus becomes one of the mostthorough, even if probably one of the most natural and of the happiest,cases of collective self-consciousness that one knows. The spectacle, asit at first met my senses, was that of a numerous community in ardentpursuit of some workable conception of its social self, and tryingmeanwhile intelligently to talk itself, and even this veryembarrassment, into a _subject_ for conversation. Such a picture mightnot seem purely pleasing, on the side of variety of appeal, and I admitone may have had ones reserves about it; reserves sometimes reflected,for example, in dim inward speculationone of the effects of theWashington air I have already glanced atas to the amount of response itmight evoke in the diplomatic body. It may have been on my part a morbidobsession, but the diplomatic body was liable to strike one there asmore characteristically abysmal than elsewhere, more impenetrablybland and inscrutably blank; and it was obvious, certainly, that theirconcern to help the place intellectually to find itself was not to beexpected to approach in intensity the concern even of a repatriatedabsentee. You were concerned only if you had, by your sensibility, astake in the game; which was the last thing a foreign representativewould wish to confess to, this being directly opposed to all hisenjoined duties. It is no part of the office of such personages toassist the societies to which they are accredited to find themselvesitis much more their mission to leave all such vaguely and, so far as maybe, grotesquely groping: so apt are societies, in finding themselves, tofind other things too. This detachment from the whole mild convulsion ofeffort, the considerate pretence of not being too aware of it, combinedwith latent probabilities of alarm about it no less than of amusement,represented, to the unquiet fancy, much more the spirit of the old-timeLegations.What _was_, at all events, better fun, of the finer sort, than havingones self a stake in the outcome?what helped the time (so much of itas there was!) more to pass than just to join in the so fresh experimentof constitutive, creative talk? The boon, it should always be mentioned,meanwhile went on not in the least in the tone of solemnity. That wouldhave been fatal, because probably irritating, and it was where the goodstar of Washington intervened. The tone was, so to speak, of _conscious_self-consciousness, and the highest genius for conversation doubtlessdwelt in the fact that the ironic spirit was ready always to give itsvery self away, fifty times over, for the love, or for any quickening,of the theme. The foundation for the whole happy predicament remained,moreover, of the firmest, and the essence of the case was to be aseasily stated as the great social fact is, in America, whether throughexceptions or aggravations, everywhere to be stated. Nobody was inbusinessthat was the sum and substance of it; and for the one largehuman assemblage on the continent of which this was true the differencemade was huge. Nothing could strike one more than that it was the onlyway in which, over the land, a difference _could_ be made, and than how,in our vast commercial democracy, almost any differenceby which I meanalmost any exceptionpromptly acquires prodigious relief. The value herewas at once that the place could offer to view a society, the only onein the country, in which Men existed, and that that rich little factbecame the key to everything. Superficially taken, I recognize, thecircumstance fails to look portentous; but it looms large immediately,gains the widest bearing, in the light of any direct or extendedacquaintance with American conditions. From the moment it is adequatelyborne in mind that the business-man, in the United States, may, with nomatter what dim struggles, gropings, yearnings, never hope to beanything _but_ a business-man, the size of the field he so abdicates ismeasured, as well as the fact of the other care to which his abdicationhands it over. It lies there waiting, pleading from all its pores, to beoccupiedthe lonely waste, the boundless gaping void of society; whichis but a rough name for all the _other_ so numerous relations with theworld he lives in that are imputable to the civilized being. Here it isthen that the world he lives in accepts its doom and becomes, by hisdefault, subject and plastic to his mate; his default having made, allaround him, the unexampled opportunity of the womanwhich she would havebeen an incredible fool not to pounce upon. It needs little contact withAmerican life to perceive how she _has_ pounced, and how, outsidebusiness, she has made it over in her image. She has been, up to now, onthe vast residual tract, in peerless possession, and is occupied indeveloping and extending her wonderful conquest, which she appreciatesto the last inch of its extent.                                  IIIShe has meanwhile probably her hours of amazement at the size of herwindfall; she cannot quite live without wonder at the oddity of her sosleeping partner, the strange creature, by her side, with his valuesand his voids, but who is best known to her as having yielded what shewould have clutched to the death. Yet these are mere mystic, inscrutablepossibilitiesdreams, for us, of her hushed, shrouded hours: the faceshe shows, on all the facts, is that of mere unwinking tribute to thematter of course. The effect of these high signs of assurance in her hasbeenand it is really her master-stroketo represent the situation asperfectly normal. Her companions attitude, totally destitute of highsigns, does everything it can to further this feat; so that, as disposedtogether in the American picture, they testify, extraordinarily, to the_successful_ rupture of a universal law, the sight is at first, forobservation, most mystifying. Then the impunity of the whole thing gainsupon us; the equilibrium strikes us, however strangely, as at leastprovisionally stable; we see that a society in many respects workablewould seem to have been arrived at, and that we shall in any case havetime to study it. The phenomenon may easily become, for a spectator, thesentence written largest in the American sky: when he is in search ofthe characteristic, what else so plays the part? The woman is two-thirdsof the apparent lifewhich means that she is absolutely all of thesocial; and, as this is nowhere else the case, the occasion is uniquefor seeing what such a situation may make of her. The result elsewhere,in Europe generally, of conditions in which men have activelyparticipated and to which, throughout, they personally contribute, shehas only the old story to tell, and keeps telling it after her fashion.The woman produced by a women-made society alone has obviously quite anew storyto which it is not for a moment to be gainsaid that the worldat large has, for the last thirty years in particular, found itselflending an attentive, at times even a charmed, ear. The extent andvariety of this attention have been the specious measure of the personalsuccess of the type in question, and are always referred to when itsvalue happens to be challenged. The American woman?why, she hasbeguiled, she has conquered, the globe: look at her fortune everywhereand fail to accept her if you can.She has been, accordingly, about the globe, beyond all doubt, a hugesuccess of curiosity; she has at her bestand far beyond anyconsciousness and intention of her own, lively as these for the mostpart usually areinfinitely amused the nations. It has been found amongthem that, for more reasons than we can now go into, her manner ofembodying and representing her sex has fairly made of her a new humanconvenience, not unlike fifty of the others, of a slightly differentorder, the ingenious mechanical appliances, stoves, refrigerators,sewing-machines, type-writers, cash-registers, that have done so much,in the household and the place of business, for the American name. Bywhich I am of course far from meaning that the revelation has been ofher utility as a domestic drudge; it has been much rather in the factthat the advantages attached to her being a woman at all have been sohappily combined with the absence of the drawbacks, for personsintimately dealing with her, traditionally suggested by that condition.The corresponding advantages, in the light of almost any old order, havealways seemed inevitably paid for by the drawbacks; but here,unmistakably, was a case in whichas at first appeared, certainlytheywere to be enjoyed very nearly for nothing. What it came to, evidently,was that she had been grown in an air in which a hundred of theEuropean complications and dangers didnt exist, and in which also shehad had to take upon herself a certain training for freedom. It was notthat she had had, in the vulgar sense, to look out for herself,inasmuch as it was of the very essence of her position not to bethreatened or waylaid; but that she could develop her audacity on thebasis of her security, just as she could develop her powers in amedium from which criticism was consistently absent. Thus she arrived,full-blown, on the general scene, the least criticized object, inproportion to her importance, that had ever adorned it. It would takelong to say why her situation, under this retrospect, may affect theinner fibre of the critic himself as one of the most touching on record;he may merely note his perception that she was to have been after allbut the sport of fate. For why need she originally, he wonders, haveembraced so confidently, so gleefully, yet so unguardedly, the termsoffered her to an end practically so perfidious? Why need she, unless inthe interest of her eventual discipline, have turned away with so lighta heart after watching the Man, the deep American man, retire into histent and let down the flap? She had her paper from him, theiragreement signed and sealed; but would she not, in some other air andunder some other sky, have been visited by a saving instinct? Would shenot have said No, this is too unnatural; there must be a trap in itsomewhereits addressed really, in the long run, to making a fool ofme? It is impossible, of course, to tell; and her case, as it standsfor us, at any rate, is that she showed no doubts. It is not on theAmerican scene and in the presence of mere American phenomena that sheis even yet to be observed as showing them; but does not my digressionfind itself meanwhile justified by the almost clear certainty that thefirst symptoms of the revulsionof the _con_vulsion, I am tempted tosaymust break out in Washington?For hereand it is what I have been so long in coming tohere alone inthe American world, do we catch the other sex not observing theagreement. I have described this anomaly, at Washington, as that ofMans socially existing; since we have seen that his fidelity to hiscompact throughout the country in general has involved his not doing so.What has happened, obviously, has been that his reasons, at a stroke,have dropped, and that he finds himself, without them, a differentcreature. He has discovered that he _can_ exist in other connectionsthan that of the Market, and that all he has therefore to settle is thequestion of whether he may. The most delicate interest of Washington isthe fact that it is quite practically _being_ settled therein thepractical way which is yet also the dramatic. _Solvitur ambulando_; itis being settledthat is the charmas it goes, settled withoutdiscussion. It would be awkward and gross to say that Man has dealt anyconscious blow at the monopoly of his companion, or that her prestige,as mistress of the situation, has suffered in any manner a notedabatement. Yet none the less, as he has there, in a degree, sociallyfound himself and, allured by the new sense, is evidently destined toseek much further still, the sensible effect, the change of impressionon ones coming from other places, is of the most marked. Man issolidly, vividly present, and the presence of Woman has consequently,for the proposed intensity, to reckon with it. The omens on behalf ofthe former appearance are just now strikingly enhanced, as happens, bythe accident of the rare quality, as it were, of the particular malepresence supremely presiding there; and it would certainly be strangethat this idea of the re-committal to masculine hands of some share atleast in the interests of civilization, some part of the social propertyand social office, should not, from so high an example, have received anew impulse and a new consecration. Easily enough, if we had space hereto consider it, might come up the whole picture of the new indicationsthus afforded, the question of the degree in which a sex capable, in theAmerican air, of having so despoiled itself may really be capable ofretracing its steps and repairing its mistake. It would appearinevitable to ask whether such a mistake on such a scale _can_ proveeffectively reparablewhether ground so lost can be effectivelyrecovered. Has not the American woman, with such a start, gained such anirreducible advance, on the whole high plane of the amenities, that hercompanion will never catch up with her? This last is an inquiry that Imust, alas, brush aside, though feeling it, as I have already noted,_the_ most oddly interesting that the American spectacle proposes to us;only saying, provisionally, that the aspect of manners through thenation at large offers no warrant whatever for any prompt No to it.It is not, however, of the nation at large I here speak; the case is ofthe extremely small, though important and significant, fraction of thewhole represented by the Washington groupwhich thus shows us theExpropriated Half in the very act of itself pondering that issue. Is theman up to it, up to the major heritage, the man who _could_,originally, so inconceivably, and for a mere mess of pottage if thereever was one, let it go? Are we up to it, really, at this time of day,and what on earth will awfully become of us if the question, once put tothe test, shall have to be decided against us? I think it not merelyfanciful to say that some dim, distressful interrogative sound of thatsort frequently reached, in the Washington air, the restlessanalystthough not to any quickening of his own fear. With a perfectconsciousness that it was still early to say, that the data are as yetinsufficient and that the missing quantity must absolutely be foundbefore it can be weighed and valued, he was none the less struck withthe felicity of many symptoms and would fairly have been able to believeat moments that the character hitherto so effaced has but to show theconfidence of taking itself for granted. That act of itself reveals,restores, reinstates and completes this character. Is it not, for thatmatter, essentially implied in our recognition of the place as the Cityof Conversation? The victim of effacement, the outcast at the door, has,all the while we have been talking of him, _talked himself_ back; and ifanything could add to this happy portent it would be another that hadscarcely less bearing. Nowhere more than in Washington, positively, werethe women to have struck me as naturally and harmoniously in the socialpictureas happily, soothingly, proportionately, and no more thanproportionately, participant and ministrant. Hence the irresistibleconclusion that with the way really shown them they would only ask totake it; the way being their assent to the truth that the abdication ofthe Man proves ever (after the first flush of their triumph) as badreally for their function as for his. Hence, in fine, the appearancethat, with the proportions re-established, they will come to recognizetheir past world as a fools paradise, and their present, and still moretheir future, as much more made to endure. They could not, one reasoned,have been, in general, so perfectly agreeable unless they had beenpleased, and they could not have been pleased without the prospect ofgaining, by the readjusted relation, more, on the whole, than they wereto lose; without the prospect even again perhaps of truly andinsidiously gaining more than the other beneficiary. That _would_ be, Ithink, the feminine conception of a readministered justice. Washington,at such a rate, in any case, might become to them as good as Europe,and a Europe of their own would obviously be better than a Europe ofother peoples. There are, after all, other women on the othercontinents.                                   IVOne might have been sure in advance that the character of a democracywould nowhere more sharply mark itself than in the democratic substitutefor a court city, and Washington is cast in the mould that expressesmost the absence of salient social landmarks and constituted features.Here it is that conversation, as the only invoked presence, betrays alittle its inadequacy to the furnishing forth, all by itself, of anoutward view. It tells us it must be there, since in all the wide emptyvistas nothing else is, and the general elimination _can_ but have leftit. A pleading, touching effect, indeed, lurks in this sense of it asseated, at receipt of custom, by any decent door of any decent domicileand watching the vacancy for reminder and appeal. It is left toconversation alone to people the scene with accents; putting aside twoor three objects to be specified, there is _never_ an accent in it, upand down, far and wide, save such as fall rather on the ear of the mind:those projected by the social spirit starved for the sense of anoccasional emphasis. The White House is an accentone of the lightest,sharpest possible; and the Capitol, of course, immensely, another;though the latter falls on the exclusively political page, as to which Ihave been waiting to say a word. It should meanwhile be mentioned thatwe are promised these enhancements, these illustrations, of the greatgeneral text, on the most magnificent scale; a splendid projected andannounced Washington of the future, with approaches even now grandlyoutlined and massively marked; in face of which one should perhapsconfess to the futility of any current estimate. If I speak thus of theCapitol, however, let me not merely brush past the White House to get toitany more than feel free to pass into it without some preliminarystare at that wondrous Library of Congress which glitters in fresh andalmost unmannerly emulation, almost frivolous irrelevance of form, inthe neighbourhood of the greater building. About the ingenuities andsplendours of this last costly structure, a riot of rare material andrich ornament, there would doubtless be much to saydid not oneeverywhere, on all such ground, meet the open eye of criticism simply toestablish with it a private intelligence, simply to respond to it by adeprecating wink. The guardian of that altar, I think, is but toowilling, on such a hint, to let one pass without the sacrifice.It is a case again here, as on fifty other occasions, of the tributeinstantly paid by the revisiting spirit; but paid, all without question,to the general _kind_ of presence for which the noisy air, over theland, feels so sensibly an inward achethe presence that correspondsthere, no matter how loosely, to that of the housing and harbouringEuropean Church in the ages of great disorder. The Universities and thegreater Libraries (the smaller, for a hundred good democratic reasons,are another question), repeat, in their manner, to the imagination, Eastand West, the note of the old thick-walled convents and quiet cloisters:they are large and charitable, they are sturdy, often proud and oftenrich, and they have the incalculable value that they represent the onlyintermission to inordinate rapacious traffic that the scene offers toview. With this suggestion of sacred ground they play even upon the mostrestless of analysts as they will, making him face about, with ecstasy,any way they seem to point; so that he feels it his business much lessto count over their shortcomings than to proclaim them places ofenchantment. They are better at their worst than anything else at itsbest, and the comparatively sweet sounds that stir their theoreticstillness are for him as echoes of the lyre of Apollo. The CongressionalLibrary is magnificent, and would become thus a supreme sanctuary evenwere it ten times more so: there would seem to be nothing then but topronounce it a delight and have done with itor let the appalledimagination, in other words, slink into it and stay there. But here ispressed precisely, with particular force, the spring of the questionthat takes but a touch to sound: is the case of this remarkablecreation, by exception, a case in which the violent waving of thepecuniary wand _has_ incontinently produced interest? The answer canonly be, I feel, a shy assentthough shy indeed only till the logic ofthe matter is apparent. This logic is that, though money alone cangather in on such a scale the treasures of knowledge, these treasures,in the form of books and documents, themselves organize and furnishtheir world. They appoint and settle the proportions, they thicken theair, they people the space, they create and consecrate all theirrelations, and no one shall say that, where they scatter life, whichthey themselves in fact _are_, history does not promptly attend.Emphatically yes, therefore, the great domed and tiered, galleried andstatued central hall of the Congressional, the last word of currentconstructional science and artistic resource, already crowns itself withthat grace.The graceful thing in Washington beyond any other, none the less, is theso happily placed and featured White House, the late excellentextensions and embellishments of which have of course representedexpenditurebut only of the refined sort imposed by some matureportionless gentlewoman on relatives who have accepted the principle ofmaking her, at a time of life, more honourably comfortable. The wholeample precinct and margin formed by the virtual continuity of itsgrounds with those expanses in which the effect of the fine WashingtonObelisk rather spends or wastes itself (not a little as if some loudmonosyllable had been uttered, in a preoccupied company, without a dueproduction of sympathy or sense)the fortunate isolation of the WhiteHouse, I say, intensifies its power to appeal to that musing and mooningvisitor whose perceptions alone, in all the conditions, I hold worthy ofaccount. Hereabouts, beyond doubt, history had from of old seemed to meinsistently seated, and I remember a short spring-time of years ago whenLafayette Square itself, contiguous to the Executive Mansion, couldcreate a rich sense of the past by the use of scarce other witchcraftthan its command of that pleasant perspective and its possession of themost prodigious of all Presidential effigies, Andrew Jackson, as archaicas a Ninevite king, prancing and rocking through the ages. If thatatmosphere, moreover, in the fragrance of the Washington April, was evena quarter of a century since as a liquor of bitter-sweet taste,overflowing its cup, what was the ineffable mixture now, with all theelements further distilled, all the life further sacrificed, to make itpotent? One circled about the place as for meeting the ghosts, and onepaused, under the same impulse, before the high palings of the WhiteHouse drive, as if wondering at haunted ground. There the ghosts stoodin their public array, spectral enough and clarified; yet scarce makingit easier to place the strange, incongruous blood-drops, as one lookedthrough the rails, on that revised and freshened page. But onefortunately has ones choice, in all these connections, as one turnsaway; the mixture, as I have called it, is really here so fine. GeneralJackson, in the centre of the Square, still rocks his hobby and theearth; but the fruit of the interval, to my actual eyes, hangs nowherebrighter than in the brilliant memorials lately erected to Lafayette andto Rochambeau. Artful, genial, expressive, the tribute of French talent,these happy images supply, on the spot, the note without which even themost fantasticating sense of our national past would feel itself rubforever against mere brown homespun. Everything else gives way, for me,I confess, as I again stand before them; everything, whether as historicfact, or present _agrment_, or future possibility, yields to this onehigh luxury of our old friendship with France.The artistic Federal city already announced spreads itself then beforeus, in plans elaborated even to the finer details, a city of palaces andmonuments and gardens, symmetries and circles and far radiations, withthe big Potomac for water-power and water-effect and the recurrentMaryland spring, so prompt and so full-handed, for a perpetualbenediction. This imagery has, above all, the value, for the consideringmind, that it presents itself as under the wide-spread wings of thegeneral Government, which fairly make it figure to the rapt vision asthe object caught up in eagle claws and lifted into fields of air thateven the high brows of the municipal boss fail to sweep. The wide-spreadwings affect us, in the prospect, as great fans that, by their meretremor, will blow the work, at all steps and stages, clean and clear,disinfect it quite ideally of any germ of the job, and prepare therebyfor the American voter, on the spot and in the pride of possession,quite a new kind of civic consciousness. The scheme looms largest,surely, as a demonstration of the possibilities of that service to him,and nothing about it will be more interesting than to measurethoughthis may take timethe nature and degree of his alleviation. Will thenew pride I speak of sufficiently inflame him? Will the taste of the newconsciousness, finding him so fresh to it, prove the right medicine? Onecan only regret that we must still rather indefinitely wait to seeandregret it all the more that there is always, in America, yet anotherlively source of interest involved in the execution of such designs, andclosely involved just in proportion as the high intention, the formalmajesty, of the thing seems assured. It comes back to what we constantlyfeel, throughout the country, to what the American scene everywheredepends on for half its appeal or its effect; to the fact that thesocial conditions, the material, pressing and pervasive, make theparticular experiment or demonstration, whatever it may pretend to,practically a new and incalculable thing. This general Americanism isoften the one tag of character attaching to the case after every otherappears to have abandoned it. The thing is happening, or will have tohappen, in the American waythat American way which is more differentfrom all other native ways, taking country with country, than any ofthese latter are different from each other; and the question is of how,each time, the American way will see it through.The element of suspensebeguilement, ever, of the sincere observerisprovided for by the fact that, though this American way never fails tocome up, he has to recognize as by no means equally true that it neverfails to succeed. It is inveterately applied, but with consequencesbewilderingly various; which means, however, for our present moral, butthat the certainty of the _determined_ American effect is an element toattend quite especially such a case as the employment of the arts ofdesign, on an unprecedented scale, for public uses, the adoption on thisscale of the whole sthetic law. Encountered in America, phenomena ofthis order strike us mostly as occurring in the historic void, as havingto present themselves in the hard light of that desert, and as needingto extort from it, so far as they can, something of the shading of theirinterest. Encountered in older countries, they show, on the contrary, astaking up the references, as consenting perforce to the relations, ofwhich the air is already full, and as having thereby much rather to getthemselves expressive by charm than to get themselves expressive byweight. The danger in Europe is of their having too many things tosay, and too many others to distinguish these from; the danger in theStates is of their not having things enoughwith enough tone andresonance furthermore to give them. What therefore will themultitudinous and elaborate forms of the Washington to come have tosay, and what, above all, besides gold and silver, stone and marbleand trees and flowers, will they be able to say it _with_? That is oneof the questions in the mere phrasing of which the restless analystfinds a thrill. There is a thing called interest that has to be producedfor himpositively as if he were a rabid usurer with a clutch of hisimperilled bond. He has seen again and again how the most expensiveeffort often fails to lead up to interest, and he has seen how it maybloom in soil of no more worth than so many layers of dust and ashes. Hehas learnt in facthe learns greatly in Americato mistrust any plea forit _directly_ made by money, which operates too often as the greatpuffing motor-car framed for whirling him, in his dismay, quite awayfrom it. And he has inevitably noted, at the same time, from howcomparatively few other sources this rewarding dividend on his investedattention may be drawn. He thinks of these sources as few, that is,because he sees the same ones, which are the references by whichinterest is fed, used again and again, with a desperate economy; seesthe same ones, even as the human heroes, celebrities, extemporized lionsor scapegoats, required social and educational figure-heads andvalues, having to serve in _all_ the connections and adorn all thetales. That is one of the liveliest of his American impressions. He hasat moments his sense that, in presence of such vast populations andinstilled, emulous demands, there is not, outside the mere economic,enough native history, recorded or current, to go round.                                   VIt seemed to me on the spot, moreover, that such reflections were rathermore than less pertinent in face of the fact that I was again to findthe Capitol, whenever I approached, and above all whenever I entered it,a vast and many-voiced creation. The thing depends of course somewhat onthe visitor, who will be the more responsive, I think, the further backinto the origins of the whole American spectacle his personal visionshall carry him; but this hugest, as I suppose it, of all the homes ofdebate only asks to put forth, on opportunity, an incongruous, avarious, an inexhaustible charm. I may as well say at once that I hadfound myself from the first adoring the Capitol, though I may notpretend here to dot all the is of all my reasonssince some of thesemight appear below the dignity of the subject and others alien to itssimplicity. The ark of the American covenant may strike one thus, at anyrate, as a compendium of all the national ideals, a museum, crammedfull, even to overflowing, of all the national terms and standards,weights and measures and emblems of greatness and glory, and indeed as abuilded record of half the collective vibrations of a people; theirconscious spirit, their public faith, their bewildered taste, theirceaseless curiosity, their arduous and interrupted education. Such wereto my vision at least some of its aspects, but the place had a hundredsides, and if I had had time to look for others still I felt I shouldhave found them. What it comes towhereby the pull, in America, is ofthe greatestis that association really reigns there, and in therichest, and even again and again in the drollest, forms; it is thickand vivid and almost gross, it assaults the wondering mind. Thelabyrinthine pile becomes thus inordinately _amusing_taking the term inits finer modern sense. The analogy may seem forced, but it affected meas playing in Washington life very much the part that St. Peters, ofold, had seemed to me to play in Roman: it offered afternoonentertainment, at the end of a longish walk, to any spirit in the humourfor the uplifted and flattered visionand this without suggesting thatthe sublimities in the two cases, even as measured by the profanestmind, tend at all to be equal. The Washington dome is indeed capable, inthe Washington air, of admirable, of sublime, effects; and there arecases in which, seen at a distance above its yellow Potomac, it variesbut by a shade from the senseyes, absolutely the divinecampagna-senseof St. Peters and the like-coloured Tiber.But the question is positively of the impressiveness of the greatterraced Capitol hill, with its stages and slopes, staircases andfountains, its general presentation of its charge. And if the whole massand prospect amuse, as I say, from the moment they are embraced, thevisitor curious of the _democratic assimilation_ of the greaterdignities and majesties will least miss the general logic. That is thelight in which the whole thing is supremely interesting; the light ofthe fact, illustrated at every turn, that the populations maintaining itdeal with it so directly and intimately, so sociably and humorously. Wepromptly take in that, if ever we are to commune in a concentrated waywith the sovereign people, and see their exercised power raise aside-wind of irony for forms and arrangements other than theirs, theoccasion here will amply serve. Indubitably, moreover, at a hundredpoints, the irony operates, and all the more markedly under suchpossible interference; the interference of the monumental spittoons,that of the immense amount of vulgar, of barbaric, decoration, that ofthe terrible artistic tributes from, and scarce less to, the differentStatesthe unassorted marble mannikins in particular, each a portrayalby one of the commonwealths of her highest worthy, which make the greatRotunda, the intended Valhalla, resemble a stonecutters collection ofpriced sorts and sizes. Discretion exists, throughout, only as a flowerof the very first or of these very latest years; the large middle time,corresponding, and even that unequally, with the English Victorian, ofsinister memory, was unacquainted with the name, and waits there now, inits fruits, but for a huge sacrificial fire, some far-flaringact-of-faith of the future: a tribute to the sthetic law which onealready feels stirring the air, so that it may arrive, I think, with anunexampled stride. Nothing will have been more interesting, surely, thanso public a wiping-over of the sthetic slate, with all the involvedcollective compunctions and repudiations, the general exhibition of acolossal conscience, a conscience proportionate to the size and wealthof the country. To such grand gestures does the American scene lenditself!The elements in question are meanwhile there, in any case, just as thesovereign people are there, going over their property; but we areaware none the less of impressionsthat of the ponderous proud Senate,for instance, so sensibly massive; that of the Supreme Court, so simply,one almost says so chastely, yet, while it breathes supremacy, soelegantly, so all intellectually, in sessionunder which the view,taking one extravagance with another, recurs rather ruefully to glimpseselsewhere caught, glimpses of authority emblazoned, bewigged, bemantled,bemarshalled, in almost direct defeat of its intention of gravity. Forthe reinstated absentee, in these presences, the mere recovery of nativeprivilege was at all events a balmafter too many challenged appeals andabused patiences, too many hushed circuitous creepings, among thedowntrodden, in other and more bristling halls of state. The sense of acertain large, final benignity in the Capitol comes then, I think, fromthis impression that the national relation to it is that of a hugeflourishing Family to the place of business, the estate-office, where,in a myriad open ledgers, which offer no obscurity to the hereditaryhead for figures, the account of their colossal revenue is kept. Theymeet there in safe sociability, as all equally initiated andinterestednot as in a temple or a citadel, but by the warm domestichearth of Columbia herself; a motherly, chatty, clear-spectacledColumbia, who reads all the newspapers, knows, to the last man, everyone of her sons by name, and, to the last boy, even her grandsons, andis fenced off, at the worst, but by concentric circles ofrocking-chairs. It is impossible, as I say, not to be fondly consciousof her welcomeunless again, and yet again, I read into the general air,confusedly, too much of the happy accident of the basis of myintroduction. But if my sensibility responds with intensity to this, somuch the better; for what were such felt personal aids and influences,after all, but cases and examples, embodied expressions of character,type, distinction, products of the _working_ of the wholething?specimens, indeed, highly concentrated and refined, and madethereby, I admit, more charming and insidious.It must also be admitted that to exchange the inner aspects of the vastmonument for the outer is to be reminded with some sharpness of aWashington in which half the sides that have held our attention drop, asif rather abashed, out of sight. Not its pleasant brightness as of awinter watering-place, not its connections, however indirect, with theolder, but those with the newer, the newest, civilization, seem matterof recognition for its various marble fronts; it rakes the prospect, itrakes the continent, to a much more sweeping purpose, and is visiblyconcerned but in immeasurable schemes of which it can consciously remainthe centre. Here, in the vast spacesmere empty light and air, thoughsuch pleasant air and such pretty light as yetthe great Federal futureseems, under vague bright forms, to hover and to stalk, making thehorizon recede to take it in, making the terraces too, below the longcolonnades, the admirable standpoints, the sheltering porches, ofpolitical philosophy. The comparatively new wings of the building filledme, whenever I walked here, with thanksgiving for their large andperfect elegance: so, in Paris, might the wide mated fronts that are ofsuch a noble effect on either side of the Rue Royale shine in multipliedmajesty and recovered youth over an infinite Place de la Concorde. Theseparts of the Capitol, on their Acropolis height, are ideally constructedfor raking, and for this suggestion of their dominating the Americanscene in playhouse gallery fashion. You are somehow possessed of it_all_ while you tread themtheir marble embrace appears so thecomplement of the vast democratic lap. Though I had them in general, forcontemplation, quite to myself, I met one morning a trio of Indianbraves, braves dispossessed of forest and prairie, but as free of thebuilded labyrinth as they had ever been of these; also arrayed in neatpot-hats, shoddy suits and light overcoats, with their pockets, I amsure, full of photographs and cigarettes: circumstances all thatquickened their resemblance, on the much bigger scale, to Japanesecelebrities, or to specimens, on show, of what the Government can dowith people with whom it is supposed able to do nothing. They seemedjust then and there, for a mind fed betimes on the LeatherstockingTales, to project as in a flash an image in itself immense, butforeshortened and simplifiedreducing to a single smooth stride thebloody footsteps of time. One rubbed ones eyes, but there, at itshighest polish, shining in the beautiful day, was the brazen face ofhistory, and there, all about one, immaculate, the printless pavementsof the State.                                  XII                                RICHMOND                                   IIt was, toward the end of the winter, fairly romantic to feel ones selfgoing Southin verification of the pleasant probability that, sinceones mild adventure had appeared beforehand, and as a whole, to promisethat complexion, there would now be aspects and occasions moreparticularly and deeply dyed with it. The inevitability of his beingromantically affectedbeing so more often than nothad been taken forgranted by the restless analyst from the first; his feeling that hemight count upon it having indeed, in respect to his visit, the force ofa strong appeal. The case had come to strike him as perfectly clearthecase for the singular history, the odd evolution of this confidence,which might appear superficially to take some explaining. It wasEurope that had, in very ancient days, held out to the yearning youngAmerican some likelihood of impressions more numerous and various and ofa higher intensity than those he might gather on the native scene; andit was doubtless in conformity with some such desire more finely andmore frequently to vibrate that he had originally begun to consult theEuropean oracle. This had led, in the event, to his settling to live forlong years in the very precincts, as it were, of the temple; so that thevoice of the divinity was finally to become, in his ears, of all soundsthe most familiar. It was quite to lose its primal note of mystery, tocease little by little to be strange, impressive and augustin thedegree, at any rate, in which it had once enjoyed that character. Theconsultation of the oracle, in a word, the invocation of the possiblethrill, was gradually to feel its romantic essence enfeebled, shrunkenand spent. The European complexity, working clearer to ones vision, hadgrown usual and calculablepresenting itself, to the discouragement ofwasteful emotion and of intensity in general, as the very stuff, thecommon texture, of the real world. Romance and mysteryin other wordsthe _amusement_ of interestwould have therefore at last to provide forthemselves elsewhere; and what curiously befell, in time, was that thenative, the forsaken scene, now passing, as continual rumour had it,through a thousand stages and changes, and offering a perfectiridescence of fresh aspects, seemed more and more to appeal to thefaculty of wonder. It was American civilization that had begun to spreaditself thick and pile itself high, in short, in proportion as the other,the foreign exhibition had taken to writing itself plain; and to a worldso amended and enriched, accordingly, the expatriated observer, with hisrelaxed curiosity reviving and his limp imagination once more on thestretch, couldnt fail again to address himself. Nothing could be of asimpler and straighter logic: Europe had been romantic years before,because she was different from America; wherefore America would now beromantic because she was different from Europe. It was for this smallsyllogism then to meet, practically, the test of ones repatriation; andas the palpitating pilgrim disembarked, in truth, he had felt it, likethe rifle of a keen sportsman, carried across his shoulder and ready forinstant use.What employment it was thus to find, what game it was actually to bringdown, this directed and aimed appetite for sharp impressions, is aquestion to which these pages may appear in a manner totestifyconstituting to that extent the proof of my fond calculation.It was in respect to the South, meanwhile, at any rate, that thecalculation had really been fondeston such a stored, such a waitingprovision of vivid images, mainly beautiful and sad, might one surelythere depend. The sense of these things would represent for the restlessanalyst, more than that of any others, intensity of impression; so thathis only prime discomfiture was in his having had helplessly to see hisallowance of time cut short, reduced to the smallest compass in whichthe establishment of a relation to any group of aspects might be heldconceivable. This last soreness, howeverand the point is one to bemadewas not slow, I noted, to find itself healingly breathed upon. Morepromptly in America than elsewhere does the relation to the group ofaspects begin to workwhatever the group, and I think I may add whateverthe relation, may be. Few elements of the picture are shy or lurkingelementstangled among others or hidden behind them, packed close bytime and taking time to come out. They stand there in their row like theletters of an alphabet, and this is why, in spite of the vast surfaceexposed, any item, encountered or selected, contributes to the spellingof the word, becomes on the spot generally informing and characteristic.The word so recognized stands thus, immediately, for a multitude ofothers and constitutes, to expert observation, an all-sufficientspecimen. Here, evidently, more quickly than in Europe, the visitorsays to himself, one knows what there is and what there isnt: whencethere is the less need, for ones impression, of a multiplication ofcases. A single case speaks for manysince it is again and again, as hecatches himself repeating, a question not of clustered meanings thatfall like over-ripe fruit into his lap, but of the picking out of thefew formed features, signs of character mature enough and firm enough topromise a savour or to suffer handling. These scant handfuls illustrateand typify, and, luckily, they are (as the evidence of manners andconditions, over the world, goes) quickly gathered; so that animpression founded on them is not an undue simplification. And I makeout, I think, the reflection with which our anxious explorer tacitlyconcludes. Its a bad country to be stupid innone on the whole so bad.If one doesnt know _how_ to look and to see, one should keep out of italtogether. But if one does, if one _can_ see straight, one takes in thewhole piece at a series of points that are after all comparatively few.One may neglect, by interspacing the points, a little of the accessorymatter, but one neglects none of the essential. And if one has not atlast learned to separate with due sharpness, pen in hand, the essential_from_ the accessory, one has only, at best, to muffle ones head forshame and await deserved extinction.                                   IIIt was in conformity with some such induction as the foregoing that Ihad to feel myself, at Richmond, in the midst of abnormal wintryrigours, take in at every pore a Southern impression; just as it wasalso there, before a picture charmless at the best, I seemed toapprehend, and not redeemed now by mistimed snow and ice, that I was torecognize how much I had staked on my theory of the latent poetry of theSouth. This theory, during a couple of rather dark, vain days,constituted my one solace or support, and I was most of all occupiedwith my sense of the importance of carrying it off again unimpaired. Iremember asking myself at the end of an hour or two what I had thenexpectedexpected of the interesting Richmond; and thereupon, whether orno I mustered, on this first challenge, an adequate answer, trying tosupply the original basis of expectation. By that effort, as happened,my dim perambulation was lighted, and I hasten to add that I felt thesecond branch of my question easy enough to meet. How was the sight ofRichmond not to be a potent idea; how was the place not, presumably, tobe interesting, to a restless analyst who had become conscious of thecharge involved in that title as long ago as at the outbreak of theCivil War, if not even still more promptly; and to whose youngimagination the Confederate capital had grown lurid, fuliginous, vividlytragicespecially under the process through which its fate was to closeround it and overwhelm it, invest it with one of the great reverberatinghistoric names? They hang together on the dreadful page, the cities ofthe supreme holocaust, the final massacres, the blood, the flames, thetears; they are chalked with the sinister red mark at sight of which thesensitive nerve of association forever winces. If the mere shadow hadthat penetrative power, what affecting virtue might accordingly notreside in the substances, the place itself, the haunted scene, as onemight figure it, of the old, the vast intensity of drama? One thing atleast was certainthat, however the sense of actual aspects was todisengage itself, I could not possibly have drawn near with anintelligence more respectfully and liberally prepared for hospitality toit. So, conformably with all this, how could it further not strike me,in presence of the presented appearances, that the needful perceptionswere in fact at play?I recall the shock of that question after a single interrogative stroll,a mere vague mile of which had thrown me back wondering and a triflemystified. One had had brutally to put it to ones self after aconscientious stare about: This then the tragic ghost-haunted city,this the centre of the vast blood-drenched circle, one of the _most_blood-drenched, for miles and miles around, in the dire catalogueaforesaid? One had counted on a sort of registered consciousness of thepast, and the truth was that there appeared, for the moment, on the faceof the scene, no discernible consciousness, registered or unregistered,of anything. Richmond, in a word, looked to me simply blank andvoidwhereby it was, precisely, however, that the great emotion was tocome. One could never consent merely to _taking_ it for that:intolerable the discredit so cast on ones perceptive resources. Thegreat modern hotel, superfluously vast, was excellent; but it enjoyed asa feature, as a value, an uncontested priority. It was a hugewell-pitched tent, the latest thing in tents, proclaiming in the desertthe name of a new industry. The desert, I have mentioned, was more orless muffled in snowthat furthered, I admit, the blankness; the windwas harsh, the sky sullen, the houses scarce emphasized at all ashouses; the Southern character, in fine, was nowhere. I shoulddoubtless have been embarrassed to say in what specific items I hadimagined it would naturally residesave in so far as I had attached somemystic virtue to the very name of Virginia: this instinctive imputationconstituting by itself, for that matter, a symptom of a certainsignificance. I watched and waited, giving the virtue a chance to comeout; I wandered far and wideas far, that is, as weather and seasonpermitted; they quite forbade, to my regret, the long drives involved ina visitation of the old battlefields. The shallow vistas, the looseperspectives, were as sadly simple as the faces of the blind. Was itpractically but a question then, deplorable thought, of a poor Northerncity?with the bare difference that a Northern city of such extentwould, however stricken, have succeeded, by some Northern art inpretending to resources. Where, otherwise, were the old Southernmansions on the wide verandahs and in the rank, sweet gardens of whichNorthern resources had once been held so cheap?Well, I scarce remember at what point of my peregrination, at what quitevague, senseless street-corner it was that I felt my inquiryup to thatmoment rather embarrassingturn to clearness and the whole picture placeitself in a light in which contemplation might for the time find awarrant and a clue. I at any rate almost like to live over the fewminutes in questionfor the sake of their relief and their felicity. Soretracing them, I see that the spring had been pressed for them by thepositive force of ones first dismay; a sort of intellectual bankruptcy,this latter, that one felt one really couldnt afford. There were no_references_that had been the trouble; but the reaction came with thesense that the large, sad poorness was in itself a reference, and one bywhich a hundred grand historic connections were on the spot, and quitethrillingly, re-established. What was I tasting of, at that time of day,and with intensity, but the far consequences of things, made absolutelymajestic by their weight and duration? I was tasting, mystically, of thevery essence of the old Southern ideathe hugest fallacy, as it hoveredthere to ones backward, ones ranging vision, for which hundreds ofthousands of men had ever laid down their lives. I was tasting of thevery bitterness of the immense, grotesque, defeated projectthe project,extravagant, fantastic, and to-day pathetic in its folly, of a vastSlave State (as the old term ran) artfully, savingly isolated in theworld that was to contain it and trade with it. This was what everythinground me meantthat that absurdity had once flourished there; andnothing, immediately, could have been more interesting than the lessonthat such may remain, for long years, the tell-tale face of things wheresuch absurdities _have_ flourished. Thus, by a turn of my hand, or of myhead, interest was evoked; so that from this moment I had never to letgo of it. It was to serve again, it was to serve elsewhere, and in muchthe same manner; all aspects straightway were altered by it, and thepious pilgrim came round again into his own. He had wanted, his schemehad fairly required, this particular part of the country to bebeautiful; he had really needed it to be, he couldnt afford, in duedeference to the intellectual economy imposed on him, its not being.When things were grandly sad, accordinglysad on the great scale andwith a certain nobleness of ruinan element of beauty seemed alwayssecured, even if one could scarce say why: which truth, clearly, wouldoperate fortunately for the compromised South.It came back againit was always, after this fashion, coming back, as ifto make me extravagantly repeat myselfto the quantity to be read intothe American view, in general, before it gives out an interest. Theobserver, like a fond investor, must spend on it, boldly, ingeniously,to make it pay; and it may often thus remind one of the wonderful soilof California, which is nothing when left to itself and the fineweather, but becomes everything conceivable under the rainfall. Whatwould many an American prospect be for him, the visitor bent onappreciation frequently wonders, without his preliminary discharge uponit of some brisk shower of general ideas? The arid sand has, in aremarkable degree, the fine property of absorbing these latter and thengiving them back to the air in proportionate signs of life. There beblooming gardens, on the other hand, I take it, where the foliage ofTime is positively too dense for the general idea to penetrate or toperchas if too many ideas had already been concerned and involved andthere were nothing to do but to accept the complete demonstration. Itwas not to this order, at any rate, that my decipherable South was tobelong; but Richmond at least began to repay my outlay, from point topoint, as soon as the outlay had been made. The place was_weak_adorably weak: that was the word into which the wholeimpression flowered, that was the idea, evidently, that all the rest ofthe way as well, would be most brought home. That was the form, inshort, that the interest would take; the charmimmense, almostaugustbeing in the long, unbroken connections of the case. Here,obviously, would be the prime source of the beauty; since if to be sadwas to be the reverse of blatant, what was the sadness, taken all round,but the incurable after-taste of the original vanity and fatuity, withthe memories and penalties of which the very air seemed still charged? Ihad recently been studying, a little, the record, reading, with otherthings, the volume of his admirable History in which Mr. James FordRhoades recounts the long preliminaries of the War and shows us, alllucidly and humanely, the Southern mind of the mid-century in the veryconvulsions of its perversitythe conception that, almost comic initself, was yet so tragically to fail to work, that of a worldrearranged, a State solidly and comfortably seated and tucked in, in theinterest of slave-produced Cotton.The solidity and the comfort were to involve not only the wideextension, but the complete intellectual, moral and economicreconsecration of slavery, an enlarged and glorified, quite beatified,application of its principle. The light of experience, round about, andevery finger-post of history, of political and spiritual science withwhich the scene of civilization seemed to bristle, had, when questioned,but one warning to give, and appeared to give it with an effect of hugederision: whereby was laid on the Southern genius the necessity ofgetting rid of these discords and substituting for the ironic face ofthe world an entirely new harmony, or in other words a different schemeof criticism. Since nothing in the Slave-scheme could be said toconformconform, that is, to the reality of thingsit was the plan ofChristendom and the wisdom of the ages that would have to be altered.History, the history of everything, would be rewritten _ad usumDelphini_the Dauphin being in this case the budding Southern mind. Thismeant a general and a permanent quarantine; meant the eternalbowdlerization of books and journals; meant in fine all literature andall art on an expurgatory index. It meant, still further, an active andardent propaganda; the reorganization of the school, the college, theuniversity, in the interest of the new criticism. The testimony to thatthesis offered by the documents of the time, by State legislation, localeloquence, political speeches, the tone of the press, strikes usto-day as beyond measure queer and quaint and benightedinnocent aboveall; stamped with the inalienable Southern sign, the inimitable _rococo_note. We talk of the provincial, but the provinciality projected by theConfederate dream, and in which it proposed to steep the whole helplesssocial mass, looks to our present eyes as artlessly perverse, asuntouched by any intellectual tradition of beauty or wit, as someexhibited array of the odd utensils or divinities of lone and primitiveislanders. It came over one that they _were_ there, in the air they hadbreathed, precisely, loneeven the very best of the old Southerners;and, looking at them over the threshold of approach that poor Richmondseemed to form, the real key to ones sense of their native scene was inthat very idea of their solitude and their isolation. Thus they affectedone as such passive, such pathetic victims of fate, as so played uponand betrayed, so beaten and bruised, by the old burden of theircondition, that I found myself conscious, on their behalf, of a sort ofingenuity of tenderness.Their condition was to have waked up from far back to this thumpinglegacy of the intimate presence of the negro, and one saw them not muchless imprisoned in it and overdarkened by it to-day than they had beenin the time of their so fallacious presumption. The hauntingconsciousness thus produced is the prison of the Southern spirit; andhow was one to say, as a pilgrim from afar, that with an equal exposureto the embarrassing fact one would have been more at ones ease? I hadfound my own threatened, I remembermy ease of contemplation of thesubject, which was all there could be question ofduring some tenminutes spent, a few days before, in consideration of an African type ortwo encountered in Washington. I was waiting, in a cab, at therailway-station, for the delivery of my luggage after my arrival, whilea group of tatterdemalion darkies lounged and sunned themselves withinrange. To take in with any attention two or three of these figures hadsurely been to feel ones self introduced at a bound to the formidablequestion, which rose suddenly like some beast that had sprung from thejungle. These were its far outposts; they represented the Southern blackas we knew him not, and had not within the memory of man known him, atthe North; and to see him there, ragged and rudimentary, yet allportentous and in possession of his rights as a man, was to be not alittle discomposed, was to be in fact very much admonished. Oneunderstood at a glance how he must loom, how he must count, in acommunity in which, in spite of the ground it might cover, there werecomparatively so few other things. The admonition accordingly remained,and no further appeal was required, I felt, to disabuse a tactful mindof the urgency of preaching, southward, a sweet reasonableness abouthim. Nothing was less contestable, of course, than that such a sweetreasonableness might play, in the whole situation, a beautiful part; butnothing, also, was on reflection more obvious than that the counsel ofperfection, in such a case, would never prove oil upon the waters. Thelips of the non-resident were, at all events, not the lips to utter thiswisdom; the non-resident might well feel themselves indeed, after alittle, appointed to silence, and, with any delicacy, see their dutyquite elsewhere.It came to one, soon enough, by all the voices of the air, that thenegro had always been, and could absolutely not fail to be, intenselyon the nerves of the South, and that as, in the other time, theobserver from without had always, as a tribute to this truth, to treadthe scene on tiptoe, so even yet, in presence of the immitigable fact, alike discretion is imposed on him. He might depart from the discretionof old, if he were so moved, intrusively, fanatically, even heroically,and he would depart from it to-day, one quite recognized, with the sameeffect of importunity, but not with the same effect of gallantry. Themoral of all of which fairly became, to my sense, a soft inward dirgeover the eternal false position of the afflicted Southcondemned asshe was to institutions, condemned to a state of temper, of exasperationand depression, a horrid heritage she had never consciously invited,that bound up her life with a hundred mistakes and make-believes,suppressions and prevarications, things that really all named themselvesin the noted provincialism. None of them would have lived in the air ofthe greater worldwhich was the world that the North, with whateverabatements, had comparatively been, and had conquered by being; so thatif the actual visitor was conscious now, as I say, of the appeal to histenderness, it was by this sight of a society still shut up in a worldsmaller than what one might suppose its true desire, to say nothing ofits true desert. I can doubtless not sufficiently tell why, but therewas something in my whole sense of the South that projected at moments avivid and painful imagethat of a figure somehow blighted or stricken,discomfortably, impossibly seated in an invalid-chair, and yet fixingone with strange eyes that were half a defiance and half a deprecationof ones noticing, and much more of ones referring to, any abnormalsign. The deprecation, in the Southern eyes, is much greater to-day, Ithink, than the old lurid challenge; but my haunting similitude was animage of the keeping-up of appearances, and above all of the maintenanceof a tone, the historic high tone, in an excruciating posture. Therewas food for sympathyand the restless analyst must repeat that when hehad but tasted of it he could but make of it his full meal. Which bringshim back, by a long way round, to the grim street-corner at Richmondwhere he last left himself.                                  IIIHe could look down from it, I remember, over roofs and chimneys, throughsome sordid gap, at an abased prospect that quite failed to beckonthatof the James River embanked in snow and attended by waterside industriesthat, in the brown haze of the weather, were dingy and vague. There hadbeen an indistinct sign for himsomewhere there had stood the Libbyprison; an indication that flung over the long years ever so dreary abridge. He lingered to take it infrom so far away it came, the strangeapparition in the dress of another day; and with the interest of notingat the same time how little it mattered for any sort of intensity(whether of regret or of relief) that the structure itself, so sinisterto the minds eye, should have materially vanished. It was still thereenough to parade its poor ghosts, but the value of the ghosts,precisely, was that they consented, all alike, on either side, to thegrand epic dimness. I recognize, moreover, with the lapse of time, thepositive felicity of my not having to connect them with the ruin of aparticular squalid tobacco-house. The concrete, none the less, did, inthe name of history, await me, and I indeed recollect pursuing it withpertinacity, for conscience sake, all the way down a wide, steepstreet, a place of traffic, of shops and offices and altogether shabbyVirginia vehicles, these last in charge of black teamsters who nowemphasized for me with every degree of violence that already-apprehendednote of the negro really at home. It fades, it melts away, with apromptitude of its own almost, any random reflection of the Americanpicture; and though the restless analyst has arts of _his_ own forfixing and saving itas he at least on occasion fondly flattershimselfhe is too often reduced to wondering what it can have consistedof in a given case save exactly that projected light of his conscience.Richmond_there_ at least was a definite factis a city of more or lessnobly-precipitous hills, and he recalls, of his visit to the avenueaforesaid, no intellectual consequence whatever but the after-sense ofhaving remounted it again on the opposite side.It was in succession to this, doubtless, that he found himselfconsulting the obscure oracle of the old State House or Capitol, seat ofthe Confederate legislature, strange intellectual centre of the generalenterprise. I scarce know in what manner I had expected it to regaleeither my outward or my inward sense; one had vaguely heard that it wasfine and at the height, or in the key, of the old Virginian dignity.The approach to it had been adorned, from far back, moreover, as oneremembered, with Crawfords celebrated monument to Washington attendedby famous Virginianswhich work indeed, I promptly perceived, answeredto its reputation, with a high elegance that was quite of themid-century, and yet that, indescribably archaic, made the mid-centuryseem remote and quaint and queer, as disconnected from us as theprolific age of Cyprus or of Crete. It is positive that of the oldAmerican sculpture, about the Union, a rich study might be made. Whatshall I say of this spot at large, and of the objects it presented toview, if not that here, where all the elements of life had been most infiery fusion, everything was somehow almost abjectly frigid and thin?The small shapeless Square, ancient acropolitan seat, ill placed on itseminence, showed, I recollect, but a single figure in motionthat of agentleman to whom I presently put a question and who explained to methat the Capitol, masked all round in dense scaffolding, though withouta labourer visible, had been very bad, a mere breakable shell, and wasnow, from top to bottom, in course of reconstruction. The shell, onecould see, was empty and work suspended; and I had never, truly, itseemed to me, seen a human institution so coldly and logically broughtlow as this memorial mass, anything rewritten so mercilessly small asthis poor passage of a great historic text. The effect was as of a pageof some dishonoured authorprinted on grey paper with blunt type, andwhen I had learned from my informant that a fairly ample white house, apleasant, honest structure in the taste of sixty or eighty years since,had been Jefferson Daviss official residence during part of the War,every source of interest had been invoked and had in its measureresponded. The impression obeys, I repeat, a rigorous lawitirremediably fades, it melts away; but was there not, further, as afeature of the scene, one of those decent and dumb American churcheswhich are so strangely possessed of the secret of minimizing, to thecasual eye, the general pretension of churches?The extent to which the American air affects one as a non-conductor ofsuch pretensions is, in the presence of these heterogeneous objects, aconstant lively lesson. Looking for the most part no more established orseated than a stopped omnibus, they are reduced to the inveteratebourgeois level (that of private, accommodated pretensions merely) andfatally despoiled of the fine old ecclesiastical arrogance. This, therichest attribute they elsewhere enjoy, keeps clear of them only tobetray them, so that they remind one everywhere of organisms trying tobreathe in the void, or of those creatures of the deep sea who changecolour and shrink, as one has heard, when astray in fresh water. Thefresh water makes them indeed pullulate, but to the loss ofimportance, and nothing could more have fallen in with thatgeneralization, for the restless analyst, than the very moral of thematter, as he judged, lately put before him at the national capital.Washington already bristles, for the considering eye, with nationalaffirmationsbig builded forms of confidence and energy; but when youhave embraced them all, with the implication of all the others still tocome, you will find yourself wondering what it is you so oddly miss.Numberless things are represented, and one interest after the othercounts itself in; the great Congressional Library crowns the hill besidethe Capitol, the Departments and Institutes cover their acres and squaretheir shoulders, the obelisk to the memory of Washington climbs stillhigher; but something is absent more even than these masses arepresenttill it at last occurs to you that the existence of a religiousfaith on the part of the people is not even remotely suggested. Not aFederal dome, not a spire nor a cornice pretends to any such symbolism,and though your attention is thus concerned with a mere negative, thenegative presently becomes its sharp obsession. You reach out perhaps invain for something to which you may familiarly compare your unsatisfiedsense. You liken it perhaps not so much to a meal made savourless by thefailure of some usual, some central dish, as to a picture, nominallyfinished, say, where the canvas shows, in the very middle, with alloriginality, a fine blank space.For it is most, doubtless, the sthetic appetite in youlong richly fedelsewherethat goes unassuaged; it is your sense of the comprehensivepicture _as_ a comprehensive picture that winces, for recognition ofloss, like a touched nerve. What is the picture, collectively seen, youask, but the portrait, more or less elaborated, of a multitudinousPeople, of a social and political order?so that the effect is, for allthe world, as if, with the body and the limbs, the hands and feet andcoat and trousers, all the accessories of the figure showily painted,the neat white oval of the face itself were innocent of the brush. Youmarvel at the personage, you admire even the paintingwhich you arelargely reduced, however, to admiring in the hands and the boots, in thetexture of accompanying table-cloth, inkstand, newspaper (introducedwith a careless grace) and other paraphernalia. You wonder how he wouldlook if the face _had_ been done; though you have compensation,meanwhile, I must certainly add, in your consciousness of assisting, asyou apprehensively stand there, at something new under the sun. The sizeof the gap, the intensity of the omission, in the Washington prospect,where so much else is representative, dots with the last sharpness thedistinct _i_, as it were, of one of the promptest generalizations of therepatriated absentee. The field of American life is as bare of theChurch as a billiard-table of a centre-piece; a truth that the myriadlittle structures attended on Sundays and on the off evenings oftheir sociables proclaim as with the audible sound of the roaring of amillion mice. Or that analogy reinsistsof the difference between thedeep sea of the older sphere of spiritual passion and the shallow tidein which the inhabiting particles float perforce near the surface. Andhowever one indicates ones impression of the clearance, the clearanceitself, in its completeness, with the innumerable odd connectedcircumstances that bring it home, represents, in the history of mannersand morals, a deviation in the mere measurement of which hereafter maywell reside a certain critical thrill. I say hereafter because it is aquestion of one of those many measurements that would as yet, in theUnited States, be premature. Of all the solemn conclusions one feels asbarred, the list is quite headed, in the States, I think, by thisparticular abeyance of judgment. When an ancient treasure of preciousvessels, overscored with glowing gems and wrought, artistically, intowondrous shapes, has, by a prodigious process, been converted, through avast community, into the small change, the simple circulating medium ofdollars and nickels, we can only say that the consequent permeationwill be of values of a new order. Of _what_ order we must wait to see.All of which remarks would constitute a long excursion, I admit, fromthe sacred edifice by the Richmond street, were it not for that savinglaw, the enrichment of each hour on the American scene, that wingsalmost any observed object with a power to suggest, a possible social_porte_, soaring superior to its plain face. And I seem to recover thesense of a pretext for incurable mooning, then and there, in myintroduction, but little delayed, to the next in the scant group oflocal lions, the usual place of worship, as I understood, of theConfederate leader, from his proper pew in which Jefferson Davis wascalled, on that fine Sunday morning of the spring-time of 1865, by thenews of Lees surrender. The news had been big, but the place of worshipwas small, and, linger in it as one would, fraternize as one would withthe mild old Confederate soldier, survivor of the epic age, who made, byhis account, so lean a living of his office of sexton, one could butmoodily resent, again, its trivialization of historya process onescarce knows how to nameits inaccessibility to legend. Perhaps, afterall, it represented, in its comfortable denominational commonness, theright scene of concentration for the promoters of so barren a polity,that idea of the perpetual Southern quarantine; but no leaders of agreat movement, a movement acclaimed by a whole nation and paid for withevery sacrifice, ever took such pains, alas, to make themselves notinteresting. It was positively as if legend would have nothing to say tothem; as if, on the spot there, I had seen it turn its back on them andwalk out of the place. This is the horse, ever, that one may take to thewater, but that drinks not against his will. That was at least what itcame back tofor the musing moralist: if the question is of legend wedig for it in the deposit of history, but the deposit must be thick tohave given it a cover and let it accumulate. It was on the battlefieldsand in all the blood-drenched radius that it would be thick; here,decidedly, in the streets of melancholy Richmond, it was thin. Just so,since it was the planners and plotters who had bidden unsuccessfully forour interest, it was for the sacrificed multitude, the unsophisticated,irresponsible agents, the obscure and the eminent alike, thatdistinction might be pleaded. _They_ were buried, if one would, in thedepositwhere the restless analyst might scratch, all tenderly, tofind them.He had fortunately at this moment his impression as to where, under suchan impulse, he had best look; and he turned his steps, as with anappetite for some savour in his repast still too much withheld to thatMuseum of the relics of the Confederacy installed some years since inthe eventual White House of Richmond, the executive mansion of thelatter half of the War. Here, positively, the spirit descendedand yetall the more directly, it seemed to me, strange to say, by reason of thevery nudity and crudity, the historic, the pathetic poverty of theexhibition. It fills the whole large house, each of the leagued Statesenjoying an allotted space; and one assuredly feels, in passing fromroom to room, that, up and down the South, no equal area can so offeritself as sacred ground. Tragically, indescribably sanctified, thesedocumentary chambers that contained, so far as I remember, not a singleobject of beauty, scarce one in fact that was not altogether ugly (sovoid they were of intrinsic charm), and that spoke only of the absenceof means and of taste, of communication and resource. In these rudeaccents they phrased their interestwhich the unappeased visitor, fromthe moment of his crossing the general threshold, had recognized in factas intense. He was at his old trick: he had made out, on the spot, inother words, that here was a pale page into which he might read what heliked. He had not exchanged ten words of civility with a little oldlady, a person soft-voiced, gracious, mellifluous, perfect for herfunction, who, seated by her fire in a sort of official ante-room,received him as at the gate of some grandly bankrupt plantationhe hadnot surrendered to this exquisite contact before he felt himself up tohis neck in a delightful, soothing, tepid medium, the social tone of theSouth that _had_ been. It was but the matter of a step overhe wasafloat on other waters, and had remounted the stream of Time. I saidjust now that nothing in the Museum had beauty; but the little old ladyhad it, with her thoroughly sectional good manners, and thatpunctuality and felicity, that inimitability, one must again say, of theSouth in her, in the patriotic unction of her reference to the sorryobjects about, which transported me as no enchanted carpet could havedone. No little old lady of the North could, for the high tone and theright manner, have touched her, and poor benumbed Richmond might now beas dreary as it liked: with that small observation made my pilgrimagecouldnt be a failure.The sorry objects about were old Confederate documents, already sallowwith time, framed letters, orders, autographs, extracts, tatters of apaper-currency in the last stages of vitiation; together with fadedportraits of faded worthies, primitive products of the camera, thecrayon, the brush; of all of which she did the honours with a gentleflorid reverence that opened wide, for the musing visitor, as helingered and strolled, the portals, as it were, of a singularlyinteresting case. It was the case of the beautiful, the attachingoddity of the general Southern state of mind, or stage of feeling, inrelation to that heritage of woe and of glory of which the mementossurrounded me. These mementos were the sorry objects, and as I pursuedthem from one ugly room to anotherthe whole place wearing the air thus,cumulatively, of some dim, dusty collection of specimens, prehistoric,paleolithic, scientific, and making one grope for some verbal renderingof the grey effectthe queer elements at play wrote themselves as largeas I could have desired. On every side, I imagine, from Virginia toTexas, the visitor must become aware of themthe visitor, that is, who,by exception, becomes aware of anything: was I not, for instance,presently to recognize them, at their finest, for an almost comicambiguity, in the passionate flare of the little frontal inscriptionbehind which the Daughters of the Confederacy of the Charleston sectionnurse the old wrongs and the old wounds? These afflictions are still,thus, admirably ventilated, and what is wonderful, in the air, to-day,is the comfort and cheer of this theory of an undying rancour. Everyfacility is enjoyed for the publication of it, but as the generationthat immediately suffered and paid has almost wholly passed away, theflame-coloured _idea_ has flowered out of the fact, and the interest,the psychologic interest, is to see it so disengage itself, as legend,as valuable, enriching, inspiring, romantic legend, and settle down toplay its permanent part. Practically, and most conveniently, one feels,the South is reconciled, but theoretically, ideally, and above all forthe new generation and the amiable ladies, the ladies amiable like thecharming curatrix of the Richmond Museum, it burns with a smotheredflame. As we meanwhile look about us there, over a scene as sad,throughout, as some raw spring eventide, we feel how something of thesort must, in all the blankness, respond morally and socially to a want.The collapse of the old order, the humiliation of defeat, thebereavement and bankruptcy involved, represented, with its obscuremiseries and tragedies, the social revolution the most unrecorded andundepicted, in proportion to its magnitude, that ever was; so that thisreversion of the starved spirit to the things of the heroic age, thefour epic years, is a definite soothing salvea sentiment which has,moreover, in the South, to cultivate, itself, intellectually, fromseason to season, the field over which it ranges, and to sow with itsown hands such crops as it may harvest. The sorry objects, at Richmond,brought it homeso low the sthetic level: it was impossible, from roomto room, to imagine a community, of equal size, more disinherited of artor of letters. These about one were the only echoesdaubs ofportraiture, scrawls of memoranda, old vulgar newspapers, old rudeuniforms, old unutterable mid-Victorian odds and ends of furniture,all ghosts as of things noted at a country fair. The illiteracy seemedto hover like a queer smell; the social revolution had begotten neithersong nor storyonly, for literature, two or three biographies ofsoldiers, written in other countries, and only, for music, the weirdchants of the emancipated blacks. Only for art, I was an hour later toadd, the monument to General Lee by M. Merci of Paris; but to that, inits suburban corner, and to the strange eloquence of its isolation, Ishall presently come. The moral of the show seemed to me meanwhile thetouching inevitability, in such conditions, of what I have called thenursing attitude. What on earthnurse of a rich heroic past, nurse of afierce avenging future, nurse of any connection that would make for anybrood of visions about ones kneewouldnt one have to become, I foundmyself inwardly exclaiming, if one had this great melancholy void togarnish and to people! It was not, under this reflection, the actualinnocent flare of the altar of memory that was matter for surprise, butthat such altars should strike one, rather, as few and faint. They wouldhave been none too many for countenance and cheer had they blazed onevery hilltop.The Richmond halls, at any rate, appeared, through the chill of theseason, scantly trodden, and I met in them no fellow-visitor but a youngman of stalwart and ingenuous aspect who struck me so forcibly, after alittle, as exhaling a natural piety that, as we happened at last to berapt in contemplation of the same sad glass case, I took advantage ofthe occasion to ask him if he were a Southerner. His affirmative wasalmost eager, and he provedfor all the world like the hero of a famousnovela gallant and nameless, as well as a very handsome, youngVirginian. A farmer by occupation, he had come up on business from theinterior to the capital, and, having a part of his morning on his hands,was spending it in this visitationmade, as I gathered, by no means forthe first time, but which he still found absorbing. As a son of the newSouth he presented a lively interest of typelinguistically not least(since where doesnt the restless analyst grope for light?)and thisinterest, the ground of my here recalling him, was promptly to arrive ata climax. He pointed out to me, amid an array of antique regimentals,certain objects identical with relics preserved in his own family andthat had belonged to his father, who, enrolled at the earliest age, hadfought to the end of the War. The old implements before us bore thenumber of the Virginia regiment in which this veteran had first seenservice, and a question or two showed me how well my friend wasacquainted with his parents exploits. Enjoying, apparentlyfor he wasintelligent and humorous and highly conversablethe opportunity to talkof such things (they being, as it were, so advantageously present therewith a vague Northerner), he related, felicitously, some paternaladventure of which I have forgotten the particulars, but which compriseda desperate evasion of capture, or worse, by the lucky smashing of theskull of a Union soldier. I complimented him on his exact knowledge ofthese old, unhappy, far-off things, and it was his candid response thatwas charmingly suggestive. Oh, I should be ready to do them all overagain myself! And then, smiling serenely, but as if it behoved even theleast blatant of Northerners to understand: Thats the kind ofSoutherner _I_ am! I allowed that he was a capital kind of Southerner,and we afterwards walked together to the Public Library, where, on ourfinally parting, I could but thank him again for being so much the kindof Southerner I had wanted. He was a fine contemporary young American,incapable, so to speak, of hurting a Northern fly_as_ Northern; butwhose consciousness would have been poor and unfurnished without thiscool platonic passion. With what other pattern, personal views apart,_could_ he have adorned its bare walls? So I wondered till it came to methat, though he wouldnt have hurt a Northern fly, there were things(ah, we had touched on some of these!) that, all fair, engaging,smiling, as he stood there, he would have done to a Southern negro.                                   IVThe Public Libraries in the United States are, like the Universities,a challenge to fond fancy; by which I mean that, if, taken together,they bathe the scene with a strange hard light of their own, theindividual institution may often affect the strained pilgrim as ablessedly restful perch. It constitutes, in its degree, wherever met,a more explicit plea for the amenities, or at least a fullerexhibition of them, than the place is otherwise likely to contain; andI remember comparing them, inwardly, after periods of stress anddearth, after long, vacant stretches, to the mast-heads on which spentbirds sometimes alight in the expanses of ocean. Their function forthe student of manners is by no means exhausted with thatattributethey project, through the use made of them, twentyinteresting sidelights; but it was by that especial restorative, thatalmost romantic character I have just glanced at, that I found myselfmost solicited. It is to the inordinate value, in the picture, of thenon-commercial, non-industrial, non-financial note that they owe theirrich relief; being, with the Universities, as one never wearied ofnoting, charged with the _whole_ expression of that part of thenational energy that is not calculable in terms of mere arithmetic.They appeared to express it, at times, I admit, the strange nationalenergy, in terms of mere subjection to the spell of the lastsellerthe new novel, epidemically swift, the ubiquity of which somirrors the great continental conditions of unity, equality andprosperity; but this view itself was compatible with ones sense oftheir practical bid for the effect of distinction. There are a hundredapplications of the idea of civilization which, in a given place,outside its Library, would be all wrong, if conceivably attempted, andyet that immediately become right, incur in fact the highest sanction,on passing that threshold. They often more or less fail of course,they sometimes completely fail, to assert themselves even within theprecinct; but one at least feels that the precinct attends on them,waits and confessedly yearns for them, consents indeed to be aprecinct only on the understanding that they shall not be foreverdelayed. I wondered, everywhere, under stress of this perception, atthe general associations of the word that best describes them and thatremains so quaintly and admirably _their_ word even when their supremeright in it is most vulgarly and loudly disputed. They are the _rich_presences, even in the rich places, among the sky-scrapers, thenewspaper-offices, the highly-rented pews and the billionaires, andthey assert, with a blest imperturbable serenity, not only thateverything would be poor without them, but that even with them much isas yet deplorably poor. They in fact so inexorably establish thistruth that when they are in question they leave little to choose, Ithink, round about them, between the seats of wealth and the seats ofcomparative penury: they are intrinsically so much more interestingthan either.Was it then because Richmond at large, the old Richmond, seemed to liethere in its icy shroud with the very dim smile of modesty, the invalidgentleness, of a patient who has been freely bledwas it through profitof this impression that the town Library struck me as flushing withcolour and resource, with confidence and temperament? The beauty of thematter is that these _penetralia_, to carry it off as they do, call totheir aid, of necessity, no great store of possessionsplay their trick,if they must, with the mildest rarities. It sufficed, really, atRichmond, that the solid structureample and detached indeed, andkeeping, where it stood, the best company the place could affordshouldmake the affirmation furthest removed from the vain vaunt of the othertime, the pretence of a social order founded on delusions andexclusions. Everything else was somehow, however indirectly, the bequestof that sad age and partook more or less of its nature; this thing aloneeither had nothing to do with it or had to do with it by an appealing, aquite affecting lapse of logichis half-hours appreciation of which hadfor the restless analyst a positive melancholy sweetness. The place hadof course to be in its way a temple to the Confederate cause, but thecharm, in the spacious, handsome, convenient upper room, among booksof value and pictures of innocence, and glass cases of memorabilia morerefined than those of the collection I had previously visited, amonggentle readers, transported and oblivious, and the still gentlerspecimens, if I rightly recollect, of the pale sisterhood of theappointed and attendant fair who predominantly, throughout the States,minister to intellectual appetite and perform the intellectual service,directing and controlling them and, as would appear, triumphantlyminimizing their scope, feminizing their too possible malegrossnessesthe charm, I say, was now in the beautiful openness to theworld-relation, in the felt balm, really, of the disprovincializingbreath. Once such a summer air as that had begun softly to stir, eventhe drearier little documents might flutter in it as confederately asthey liked. The terrible framed canvases, portraits of soldiers andstatesmen, strange images, on the whole, of the sectional great, mightseem to shake, faintly, on the wall, as in vague protest at a possibledoom. Disinherited of art one could indeed, in presence of such objects,but feel that the old South had been; and might not this thin tremor, onthe part of several of those who had had so little care for it,represent some sense of what the more liberal dayso announced there onthe spotmight mean for their meagre memories?This was a question, however, that it naturally concerned me not to putto the old mutilated Confederate soldier who, trafficking in photographsin a corner of the room, rejoiced to proclaim the originals of theportraits. Nothing could have been a happier link than the oldConfederate soldiera link as from past to present and future, I mean,even when individually addicted to voicing some of the morequestionable claims of the past. What will they be, at all events, theSouthern shrines of memory, on the day the last old Confederate soldiershall have been gathered to his fate? Never, thanks to a low horizon,had the human figure endowed with almost anything at all in the natureof a presence or a silhouette such a chance to stand out; never had thepictorial accident, on a vast grey canvas, such a chance to tell. But adifferent matter from these, at Richmond, in fact the greatest matter ofall, is the statue of General Lee, which stands, high aloft andextraordinarily by itself, at the far end of the main residentialstreeta street with no imputable character but that of leading to it.Faithful, experimentally, to a desperate practice, I yet had to renounceherein the main residential streetthe subtle effort to read a senseinto the senseless appearances about me. This ranked, I scarce know why,as a disappointment: I had presumed with a fond extravagance, I havehinted, that they would give out here and there some unmistakablebackward reference, show, from the old overclambered but dispeopleddouble galleries that I might liken to desecrated cloisters, some wan,faded face of shrunken gentility. Frankly, however, with the best willin the worldreally too good a will, which found itself again and againquite grimly snubbedfrankly I could do nothing: everything was therebut the material. The disposition had been a tribute to old Virginia,but old Virginia quite unceremoniously washed her hands of me. I havespoken of scratching, scratching for romance, and all tenderly, in thedeposit of history; but, plainly, no deposit would show, and I tried toremember, for fairness, that Richmond had been after all but a modernand upstart capital. Indistinct there, below the hill, was the JamesRiver, and away in the mists of time romantic Jamestown, the creationof a Stuart king. That would have to do, though it also, in its way, wasnothing; for meanwhile in truth, just herehere above all and inpresence of the monument completing the vistawere other things toremember, provoked reflections that took on their own intensity.The equestrian statue of the Southern hero, made to order in far-awayuninterested Paris, is the work of a master and has an artisticinteresta refinement of style, in fact, under the impression of whichwe seem to see it, in its situation, as some precious pearl of oceanwashed up on a rude bare strand. The very high florid pedestal is of thelast French elegance, and the great soldier, sitting his horse with akind of melancholy nobleness, raises his handsome head as he looks offinto desolate space. He does well, we feel, to sit as high as he may,and to appear, in his lone survival, to see as far, and to overlook asmany things; for the irony of fate, crowning the picture, is surelystamped in all sharpness on the scene about him. The place is the merevague centre of two or three crossways, without form and void, with acircle half sketched by three or four groups of small, new, mean houses.It is somehow empty in spite of being ugly, and yet expressive in spiteof being empty. Desolate, one has called the air; and the effect is,strangely, of some smug up-to-date specimen or pattern of desolation.So long as one stands there the high figure, which ends for all theworld by suggesting to the admirer a quite conscious, subjective, even aquite sublime, effort to ignore, to sit, as it were, superior andindifferent, enjoys the fact of company and thereby, in a manner, ofsympathyso that the vast association of the futile for the moment dropsaway from it. But to turn ones back, one feels, is to leave it againalone, communing, at its altitude, which represents thus some prodigiousexemplary perched position, some everlasting high stool of penitence,with the very heaven of futility. So at least I felt brought round againto meeting my first surprise, to solving the riddle of the historicpoverty of Richmond. It is the poverty that _is_, exactly, historic:once take it for that and it puts on vividness. The condition attestedis the conditionor, as may be, one of the later, fainter, weakerstagesof having worshipped false gods. As I looked back, before leavingit, at Lees stranded, bereft image, which time and fortune have socheated of half the significance, and so, I think, of half the dignity,of great memorials, I recognized something more than the melancholy of alost cause. The whole infelicity speaks of a cause that could never havebeen gained.                                  XIII                               CHARLESTON                                   ITo arrive at Charleston early in the chill morning was to appear to havecome quite adventurously far, and yet to be not quite clear about thegrounds of the appearance. Did it rest on impressions gathered by theway, on the number of things one had been, since leaving Richmond, awareof?or was it rather explained by the long succession of hours, thenights and days, consumed as mere tasteless time and without theattending relish of excited interest? What, definitely, could I say Ihad seen, that my journey should already presume to give itself airs, toseat itself there as a chapter of experience? To consider of thisquestion was really, I think, after a little, to renew onesappreciation of the mystery and the marvel of experience. That accretionmay amount to an enormous sum, often, when the figures on the slate aretoo few and too paltry to mention. It may count for enrichment withoutones knowing why; and so again, on occasion, with a long column ofitems, it may count for nothing at all. I reached Charleston ever somuch (as it seemed to me) the wiserthe wiser, that is, for theimpression of scarce distinguishable things. One made them out, with nogreat brilliancy, as just Southern; but one would have missed the point,I hasten to add, in failing to see what an application and what a valuethey derived from that name. One was already beginningthat was thetruthones convenient induction as to the nature of the South; and,once that account was opened, how could everything, great or small,positive or negative, not become straightway a contribution to it? Thelarge negatives, in America, have, as well as other matters, theirmeaning and their truth: so what if my charged consciousness of the longway from Richmond were that of a negative modified by small discomforts?The discomforts indeed were as nothing, for importancecompared,candidly, with the importance of the rest of the impression. Theprocess, certainly, however one qualified it, had been interrupted byone of the most positive passages of ones lifewhich may not figurehere, alas, unfortunately, as of the essence of my journey. Vastbrackets, applied, as it were, to the very face of nature, enclosed androunded this felicity; which was no more of the texture of the generalSouthern stuff than a patch of old brocade would be of the woof of thenative homespun. I had, by a deviation, spent a week in a castle ofenchantment; but if this modern miracle, of which the mountains of NorthCarolina happened to be the scene, would have been almost anywheremiraculous, I could at least take it as testifying, all relevantly, alldirectly, for the presence, as distinguished from the absence, offeature. One felt how, in this light, the extent and the splendour ofsuch a place was but a detail; these things were accidents, withoutwhich the great effect, the element that, in the beautiful empty air,made all the difference, would still have prevailed. What was thiselement but just the affirmation of resources?made with great emphasisindeed, but in a clear and exemplary way; so that if large wealthrepresented some of them, an idea, a fine cluster of ideas, a will, apurpose, a patience, an intelligence, a store of knowledge, immediatelyworkable things, represented the others. What it thus came to, on behalfof this vast parenthetic Carolinian demonstration, was that somebody had_cared_ enoughand that happily there had been somebody _to_ care; whichstruck me at once as marking the difference for the rest of the text. Myview of the melancholy of it had been conveniently expressed, from hourto hour, by the fond reflection, through the dreary land, that nobodycaredcared really for _it_ or for anything. That fairly _made_ itdreary, as the crazy timber viaducts, where the train crawled, andsometimes nervously stopped, spanned the deep gorges and the admirablenameless and more or less torrential streams; as the sense of landscapein mere quantity became, once more, the vehicle of effect; and as wepulled up at the small stations where the social scene might besufficiently penetrated, no doubt, from the car-window.The social scene, shabby and sordid, and lost in the scale of space asthe quotable line is lost in a dull epic or the needed name in an ageingmemory, would have been as interesting, probably, as a short story inone of the slangy dialects promoted by the illustrated monthlymagazines; but it affected me above all, and almost each time, I seem toremember, as speaking of the number of things not cared for. There weresome presumably, though not at all discernibly, that _were_enough tobeget the loose human cohesion, the scant consistency of parts andpieces, to which the array by the railway platform testified; butquestions came up, plentifully, in respect to the whole picture, and ifthe mass of interests that were absent was so remarkably large, thiswould be certainly because such interests were ruled out. The grimnesswith which, as by a hard inexorable fate, so many things were ruled out,fixed itself most perhaps as the impression of the spectator enjoyingfrom his supreme seat of ease his extraordinary, his awful modernprivilege of this detached yet concentrated stare at the misery ofsubject populations. (Subject, I mean, to this superiority of his boughtconveniencesubject even as never, of old, to the sway of satraps orproconsuls.) If the subject populations on the road to Charleston,seemingly weak indeed in numbers and in energy, had to be viewed, at allevents, so vividly, as not caring, one made out quite with eagernessthat it was because they naturally couldnt. The negroes were morenumerous than the whites, but still there _were_ whitesof aspect soforlorn and depressed for the most part as to deprecate, though notcynically, only quite tragically, any imputation of value. It was amonstrous thing, doubtless, to sit there in a cushioned and kitchenedPullman and deny to so many groups of ones fellow-creatures any claimto a personality; but this was in truth what one was perpetuallydoing. The negroes, though superficially and doubtless not at allintendingly sinister, were the lustier race; but how could they care (toinsist on my point) for such equivocal embodiments of the rightcomplexion? Yet these were, practically, within the picture the onlyaffirmations of life except themselves; and they obviously, theynotoriously, didnt care for themselves. The moral of all of which wasthat really, through the more and more southward hours, the wonderingstops and the blank renewals, it was only the restless analyst himselfwho caredand enough, after all, he finally felt, to make up for otherdeficiencies.He cared even when, in the watches of the night, he was roused, underthe bewilderment that was rarely to leave him, in America, at any stageof any transaction to which the cars and their sparse sternfunctionaries formed a party, for unpremeditated transfer to a dark andfriendless void where, with what grace he could, he awaited the Februarydawn. The general American theory is that railway-travel within theconfines of the Republic is a matter of majestic simplicity andfacilityqualified at the worst by inordinate luxury; I should needtherefore an excursion here forbidden me to present another and perhapsa too highly subjective view of it. There are lights in which themajesty, if the question be of that, may strike the freshly repatriated,or in other words the unwarned and inexpert, as quite grimly formidable;lights, however, that must be left to shine for us in some otherconnection. Let it none the less glimmer out of them for the moment thatthis implication of the penalty of imperfect expertness is really a clueto the essence of the matter; a core packed, in relation to the wholesubject of expertness, with fruitful suggestion. No single admonition,in the States, I think, is more constant and vivid than the general massof intimation of what may happen to you, in transit, unless you have hadspecial and confirmed practice. You may have been without it inEurope, for moving about, and yet not perish; but to be inexpert inthe American battle would be, it struck me, much more quickly to godown. Your luggage, in America, is looked after, but you are not, saveso far as you receive on occasion a sharp order or a sharper shove: bysufferance of which discipline, moreover, you by no means alwayspurchase a prompt delivery of your effects. This indeed is but atranslation of the general truth that it is the country in the world inwhich you must do most things for yourself. It may be better for youto have thus to do for yourself the secondary as well as the primarythingsbut that is not here the question. It begins to strike you, atall events, as soon as you begin to circulate, that yourfellow-travellers are for the most part, as to the complex act itself,professional; whereas you may perform it all in Europe successfullyenough as an amateur. Whether to your glory or your shame you must ofcourse yourself decide; but impunity, nay more, success, may at leastattend your empiricism.If it was not success, however, for the strayed amateur to have foundhimself stranded in the small hours of morning by the vast vaguewayside, he still nevertheless remembers how quickly even this interludetook on an interest. The gloom was scarce penetrable, but a lightglimmered here and there, and formless sheds and shanties, dim,discomfortable things, straggled about and lost themselves.Indistinguishable engines hooted, before and behind, where red firesalso flared and vanished; indistinguishable too, from each other, whileone sought a place of temporary deposit for the impedimenta thatattested ones absurd want of rehearsal, were the cold steel of therails, the vague composition of the platform, and the kinder, the saferbreast of earth. The place was apparently a junction, and it was but aquestion of waitingof selecting as the wisest course, among the hootsand the flares, to stand huddled just where one was. That almostcompletely unservanted state which is so the mark, in general, of theAmerican station, was here the sole distinctness. I had succeeded inartlessly becoming a perfectly isolated traveller, with nobody to warnor comfort me, with nobody even to command. But it was precisely in thissituation that I felt again, as by the click of a spring, that myadventure had, in spite of everything, or perhaps indeed just because ofeverything, a charm all its ownand a charm, moreover, which I was tohave from that moment, for any connection, no difficulty whatever inrecognizing. It must have broken out more particularly, then and there,in the breath of the night, which was verily now the bland air of theSouthmild, benignant, a benediction in itself as it hung about me, andwith that blest quality in it of its appearing a medium through whichalmost any good might come. It was the air of the open gatesnot, likethat of the North, of the closed; and one inhaled it, in short, on thespot, as the very boon of ones quest.A couple of hours later, in the right train, which had at last arrived,I had so settled to submission to this spell that it had wrought for me,I think, all its magicministered absolutely to the maximum ofsuggestion, which became thus, for my introduction to Charleston, thepresiding influence. What had happened may doubtless show for no greatmatter in a bare verbal statement; yet it was to make all thedifference, I felt, for impressions (happy and harsh alike) still tocome. It couldnt have happened without ones beginning to wander; butthe lively interest was that the further one wandered the more thesuggestion spoke. The sense of the size of the Margin, that was the nameof itthe Margin by which the total of American life, huge as it alreadyappears, is still so surrounded as to represent, for the minds eye on ageneral view, but a scant central flotilla huddled as for very fear ofthe fathomless depth of water, the too formidable future, on the so muchvaster lake of the materially possible. Once that torch is at allvividly lighted it flares, for any pair of open eyes, over every scene,and with a presence that helps to explain their owners inevitablefailure to conclude. He feels it in all his uncertainties, and he neverjust escapes concluding without the sense that this so fallaciousneatness would more or less absurdly have neglected or sacrificed it.Not by any means that the Margin always affects him as standing for thevision of a possible greater good than what he sees in the givencaseany more than as standing for a possible greater evil; thesedifferences are submerged in the immense fluidity; they lurk confused,disengaged, in the mere looming mass of the _more_, the more and more tocome. And as yet nothing makes definite the probable preponderance ofparticular forms of the more. The one all positive appearance is of theperpetual increase of everything, the growth of the immeasurablemuchness that shall constitute the deep sea into which the seeker forconclusions must cast his nets. The fact that, with so many thingspresent, so few of them are not on the way to become quite other, andpossibly altogether different, things, conduces to the peculiar interestand, one often feels tempted to add, to the peculiar irritation of thecountry.                                   IICharleston early in the morning, on my driving from the station, was, ithad to be admitted, no very finished picture, but at least, already, itwas differentever so different in aspect and feeling, and above allfor intimation and suggestion, from any passage of the American scene asyet deciphered; and such became on the spot ones appetite for localcolour that one was fairly grateful to a friend who, by having promisedto arrive from the interior of the State the night before, gave one apretext for seeking him up and down. My quest, for the moment, provedvain; but the intimations and suggestions, while I proceeded from doorto door in the sweet blank freshness of the day, of the climate, of thestreets, began to swarm at such a rate that I had the sense of gatheringmy harvest with almost too eager a thrift. It was like standing steepedat the bookstall itself in the volume picked up and openedthough I mayadd that when I had presently retreated upon the hotel, to which Ishould in the first instance have addressed myself, it was quite, for aturning of pages, as if I had gone on with the set. Thus, beforebreakfast, I entered upon my brief residence with the right vibrationsalready determined and unable really to say which of a couple ofcontacts just enjoyed would have most ministered to them. I had roused,guilelessly, through an easy misunderstanding, two more or less sleepinghouseholds; but if I had still missed my clue to my friend I had yet putmyself into possession of much of whatever else I had wanted. What had Imost wanted, I could easily ask myself, but some small inkling (a merespecimen-scrap would do) of the sense, as I have to keep forever callingmy wanton synthesis, of the South before the War?an air-bubble onlyto be blown, in any case, through some odd fragment of a pipe. My pairof early Charleston impressions were thus a pair of thin prismaticbubbleswhich could have floated before me moreover but for a fewseconds, collapsing even while I stood there.Prismatically, none the less, they had shown me the old South; in onecase by the mere magic of the manner in which a small, scared, starvedperson of colour, of very light colour, an elderly mulattress in animprovised wrapper, just barely held open for me a door through which Ifelt I might have looked straight and far back into the past. The past,that of the vanished order, was hanging on there behind heras much ofit as the scant place would accommodate; and she knew this, and that Ihad so quickly guessed it; which led her, in fine, before I could seemore, and that I might not sound the secret of shy misfortune, of fadedpretension, to shut the door in my face. So, it seemed to me, had I beenconfronted, in Italy, under quite such a morning air and light, quitethe same touch of a tepid, odorous medium, with the ancient sallowcrones who guard the locked portals and the fallen pride of provincial_palazzini_. That was all, in the one instance; there had been no moreof it than of the little flare of a struck matchwhich lasted longenough, however, to light the sedative cigarette, smoked and thrownaway, that renews itself forever between the picture-seekers lips. Thesmall historic whiff I had momentarily inhaled required the correction,I should add, of the sweeter breath of my commentary. Fresh altogetherwas the air behind the garden wall that next gave way to my pursuit;there being a thrill, for that matter, in the fact that here at lastagain, if nowhere else over the land, rose the real walls that alonemake real gardens and that admit to the same by real doors. Close such adoor behind you, and you are at once _within_a local relation, apossibility of retreat, in favour of which the custom of the North hasso completely ceased to discriminate. One sacrificed the North, with itsmere hard conceit of virtuously meeting exhibitionmuch as if a housewere just a metallic machine, number so-and-so in a catalogueonesacrificed it on the spot to this finer feeling for the enclosure.That had really sufficed, no doubt, for my second initiation; since Iremember withdrawing, after my fruitless question, as on the completionof a mystic process. Initiation into _what_ I perhaps couldnt havesaid; only, at the most, into the knowledge that what such Southernwalls generally shut in proves exactly what one would have wished. I wasto see this loose quantity afterwards in greater profusion; but for themoment the effect was as right as that of privacy for the habit of thesiesta. The details escape me, or rather I tenderly withhold them. Forthe siesta therewhat would it have been most like but some deep doze,or call it frankly some final sleep, of the idea of success? And howcould one better have described the privacy, with the mild street shutoff and with the deep gallery, where resignation might sit in the shadeor swing without motion in a hammock, shut in, than as some dim dreamthat things were still as they had beenstill pleasant behind gardenwallsbefore the great folly? I was to find myself liking, in the Southand in the most monstrous fashion, it appeared, those aspects in whichthe consequences of the great folly were, for extent and gravity, stilltraceable; I was cold-bloodedly to prefer them, that is, to the aspects,occasionally to be met, from which the traces had been removed. Andthis, I need hardly say, from a point of view having so little in commonwith the vindictive as to be quite directly opposed to it. For what inthe world was one candidly to do? It is the manner of the purged andrenovated, the disconnected element, anywhere, after great trials, toexpress itself in forms comparatively vulgar; whereas those parts of theorganism that, having been through the fire, still have kept thescorches and scars, resemble for tone, for colour and value, theproducts of the potters oven; when the potter, I mean, or when, inother words, history, has been the right great artist. They at least arenot cheerful rawnessesthey have been baked beautiful and hard.I even tried, I fear, when once installed there, to look at my hotel inthat light; availing myself, to this end, of its appearance of dating,with its fine old neo-classic front and of a certain romantic grandeurof scale, the scale positively of Latin construction, in my vastsaloon-like apartment, which opened to a high colonnade. The greatcanopied and curtained bed was really in the grand manner, and the ghostof a rococo tradition, the tradition of the transatlantic South, memoryof other lands, glimmered generally in the decoration. When once Ihadthough almost exclusively under the charm of these particular fadedgraces, I admitagain privately protested that the place might have beena palace, my peace was made with Charleston: I was ripe for the lastplatitude of appreciation. Let me say indeed that this consciousness hadfrom the first to struggle with anotherthe immediate sense of thedegree in which the American scene is lighted, on occasion, to thecritical eye, by the testimony of the hotel. As had been the case for mealready at Richmond, so here again the note of that truth was sounded;the visitor interested in manners was too clearly not to escape it, andI scarce know under what slightly sinister warning he braced himself tothe fact. He had not, as yet, for repatriation, been thrown much uponthe hotel; but this was the high sense of looking further and seeingmore, this present promise of that adventure. One is thrown upon it, inAmerica, as straight upon the general painted scene over which thefootlights of publicity play with their large crudity, and against thefreely-brushed texture and grain of which you thus rub your nose moredirectly, and with less of ceremony, than elsewhere. There are endlessthings in Europe, to your vision, behind and beyond the hotel, amultitudinous complicated life; in the States, on the other hand, yousee the hotel as itself that life, as constituting for vast numbers ofpeople the richest form of existence. You have to go no distance forthis to come over youtwenty appearances so vividly speak of it. It isnot so much, no doubt, that every one lives at hotels, according tothe witless belief of Europe, but that you so quickly seem to measurethe very limited extent to which those who people them, the populationsthey appeal to in general, may be conceived as living out of them. Iremember how often, in moving about, the observation that most remainedwith me appeared to be this note of the hotel, and of the hotel-likechain of Pullman cars, as the supreme social expression. For thePullmans too, in their way, were eloquent; they affected me ever, by theend of twenty-four hours, as carrying, if not Csar and his fortune, atleast almost _all_ the facts of American life. There were some of coursethat didnt fit into them, but so many others did, and these fittedsomehow so perfectly and with such a congruity.What it comes back to is that in such conditions the elements of thesituation show with all possible, though quite unnoted, intensity; theytell you all about it (about the situation) in a few remarkably plainand distinct words; they make you feel in short how its significance iswritten upon it. It is as if the figures before you and all round you,less different from each other, less different too, I think, from theobjects about them, whatever these in any case may be, than any equalmass of appearances under the sunit is as if every one and everythingsaid to you straight: Yes, this is how we are; this is what it is toenjoy our advantages; this moreover is all there is of us; we give itall out. Make what you can of it! The restless analyst would have hadindeed an unusual fit of languor if he had not begun from the first tomake of it what he could, divided even though he was between his senseof this largely-written significance and his wonderment, none the less,as to its value and bearing: which constituted, after all, a shade ofperplexity as to its meaning. Yes, I see how you are, God knowshe wasready with his reply; for nothing in the world is easier to see, evenin all the particulars. But what does it mean to be as you are?since Isuppose it means something; something more than your mere one universaltype, with its small deflections but never a departure; something morethan your way of sitting in silence together at table, than yourextraordinary, your enormous passivity, than your apparent absence ofcriticism or judgment of anything that is put before you or that happensto you (beyond occasionally remarking that its fine!) than, in aword, the fact of what you eat and the fact of how you eat it. You arenot final, complacently as you appear so much of the time to assumeityour mere inevitable shaking about in the Margin must more or lesstake care of that; since you cant be so inordinately passive(everywhere, one infers, but in your particular wary niche of yourbusiness-block) without being in _some_ degree plastic. Distinct asyou are, you are not even definite, and it would be terrible not to beable to suppose that you are as yet but an instalment, a current number,like that of the morning paper, a specimen of a type in course ofserialization-like the hero of the magazine novel, by thehighly-successful author, the climax of which is still far off. Thus, asyou are perpetually provisional, the hotels and the PullmansthePullmans that are like rushing hotels and the hotels that are likestationary Pullmansrepresent the stages and forms of your evolution,and are not a bit, in themselves, more final than you are. Theparticulars still to be added either to you or to them form an insolublequestion; and meanwhile, clearly, your actual stage will not be short.So much as that, I recall, had hummed about my ears at Richmond, wherethe strong vertical light of a fine domed and glazed cortile, thespacious and agreeable dining-hall of the inn, had rested on the humanscene as with an effect of mechanical pressure. If the scene constitutedevidence, the evidence might have been in course of being pressed out,in this shining form, by the application of a weight and the turn of ascrew. There it was, accordingly; there was the social, the readablepage, with its more or less complete report of the conditions. Thereport was to be fuller as to some of these at Charleston; but I had atleast grasped its general value. And I shall come back to the Charlestonreport.It would have been a sorry business here, however, if this had beenmainly the source of my impressionswhich was so far from the case thatI had but to go forth, after breakfast, to find insidious charm, theappeal of the outer, the larger aspect, await me at every turn. The dayannounced itself as warm and radiant, and, keeping its promise to theend, squared itself there as the golden frame of an interestingpictureinteresting above all from the moment one desired with anyintensity to find it so. The vision persists, with its charming,touching features; yet when I look back and ask myself what can havemade my impression, all round, so positive, I am at a loss for elementsto refer it to. Elements there were, certainly; in especial the factthat during these first bland hours, charged with the splendour ofspring, I caught the wide-eyed smile of the South, that expression of atemperamental felicity in which shades of character, questions of realfeature, other marks and meanings, tend always to lose themselves. But adeficiency was clear, which was neither more nor less than thedeficiency of life; without life, all gracefully, the picture managed tocompose itself. Even while one felt it do so one missed the preciouspresence; so that there at least was food for wonderment, for admirationof the art at play. To what, all the while, as one went, could onecompare the mystification?to what if not to the image of some handsomepale person, a beauty (to call her so) of other days, who, besidesconfessing to the inanimate state from closed eyes and motionless lips,from the arrest of respiration and gesture, was to leave one, by thedays end, with the sense of a figure prepared for romantic interment,stretched in a fair winding-sheet, covered with admirable flowers,surrounded with shining tapers. _That_, one reasoned, would be somethingto have seen; and yet ones interest was not so limited. Ruins, to beinteresting, have to be massive; and poor bitter-sweet Charlestonsuffered, for the observer, by the merciless law of the thinness, makingtoo much for transparency, for the effect of paucity, still inherent inAmerican groupings; a law under which the attempt to subject them toportraiture, to see them as composing, resembles the attempt to playwhist with an imperfect pack of cards. If one had already, at the North,divined the general complexion as probably thin, in this sense,everywherethin, that is, for all note-taking but the statistical, underwhich it might of course show as portentously thickit wouldnt turndense or rich of a sudden, even in an air that could so drench it withbenignity. Therefore if the scene, as one might say, was but thehistoric Desert without the historic Mausoleum, how was ones impressionto give out, as it clearly would, the after-taste of experience?To let this small problem worry me no longer than it might, I sought ananswer, and quickly found one, in the fortunate fact of my not havingfailed, after all, of the admirably suggestive society of mydistinguished and competent friend. He _had_ arrived over-night,according to my hope, and had only happened to lodge himself momentarilyout of my ken; so that as soon as I had his company to profit by I feltthe analytic burden of my own blessedly lifted. I took over hisanalysis, infinitely better adjusted to the case and which clearly wouldsuffice for everythingif only it should itself escape disintegration.Let me say at once that it quite avertedwhether consciously orunconsciously, whether as too formidably bristling or as too perfectlypacificthat menace; which success was to provide for us both, I think,a rounded felicity. My companion, a Northerner of Southern descent (aswell as still more immediately, on another side, of English), knew hisSouth in general and his Carolina of that ilk in particular, with anintimacy that was like a grab-bag into which, for illustration, he mightalways dip his hand (a movement that, had the grab-bag been European,I should describe rather as a plunge of his arm: so that it comes backagain to the shallowness of the American grab-bag, as yet, forillustrations other than the statistical). He held up for me his brightcritical candle, which even in the intrinsic Charleston vividness madeits gay flicker, and it was under this aid that, to my extremeconvenience, I was able to feel the place. My fortune had indeed anodd sequelwhich I mention for its appreciatory value; the mishaps andaccidents of appreciation being ever, in their way, I think, ascontributive to judgment as the felicities. I was to challenge, toorecklessly, the chances of a second day; having by the end of the first,and by the taking of example, quite learned to treat the scene as agrab-bag for my own hand. I went over it again, in an evilhourwhereupon I met afresh the admonition, already repeatedly received,that where, in the States, the interest, where the pleasure ofcontemplation is concerned, discretion is the better part of valour andinsistence too often a betrayal. It is not so much that the hostile factcrops up as that the friendly fact breaks down. If you have luckily_seen_, you have seen; carry off your prize, in this case, instantly andat any risk. Try it again and you dont, you wont, see; for there is inall contemplation, there is even in any clear appreciation, an elementof the cruel. These things demand that your exposed object shall, firstof all, exist; and to exist for exposure is to be at the best impaled onthe naturalists pin. It takes superpositions, at any rate, to defysufficiently this sort of attention; it takes either the stoutnesses ofhistory or the rarest rarities of nature to resist fatal penetration.That was to come home to me presently in Floridathrough the touchedsense of the truth that Florida, ever so amiably, is weak. You may livethere serenely, no doubtas in a void furnished at the most with velvetair; you may in fact live there with an idea, if you are content thatyour idea shall consist of grapefruit and oranges. Oranges, grapefruitand velvet air constitute, in a manner, I admit, a feast; but press uponthe board with any greater weight and it quite gives wayits three orfour props treacherously forsake it. That is what I mean by theimpression, in the great empty peninsula, of weakness; which I was tofeel still clearer about on being able to compare it afterwards with theimpression of California. California was to haveif I may decently bepremature about ither own treachery; but she was to wind one up muchhigher before she let one down. I was to find her, especially at thefirst flush, unlike sweet frustrated Florida, ever so amiably strong:which came from the art with which she makes the stoutnesses, as I havecalled them, of natural beauty stand you in temporary stead of theleannesses of everything else (everything that might be of an orderequally interesting). This she is on a short acquaintance quiteinsolently able to do, thanks to her belonging so completely to thehandsome side of the continent, of which she is the finest expression.The aspect of natural objects, up and down the Pacific coast, is asaristocratic as the comprehensive American condition permits anythingto be: it indeed appears to the ingenious mind to represent an instincton the part of Nature, a sort of shuddering, bristling need, to braceherself in advance against the assault of a society so much less markedwith distinction than herself. If I was to conceive therefore underthese later lights, that her spirit had put forth nowhere on thesub-tropical Atlantic shore anything to approach this conscious pride,so, doubtless, the Carolinian effect, even at its sweetest, was tostrike me as related to it very much as a tinkle is related to a boom.                                  IIITo stray but for an instant into such an out-of-the-way corner of onesnotes, however, is to give the lie to the tenderness that asserteditself so promptly as the very medium of ones perception. There wasliterally no single object that, from morn to nightfall, it was not morepossible to consider with tenderness, a rich consistency of tenderness,than to consider without it: _such_ was the subtle trick that Charlestoncould still play. There echoed for me as I looked out from the Batterythe recent speech of a friend which had had at the time a depressingweight; the Battery of the long, curved sea-front, of the watersidepublic garden furnished with sad old historic guns, with live-oaksdraped in trailing moss, with palmettos that, as if still mindful oftheir State symbolism, seem to try everywhere, though with a melancholysceptical droop, to repeat the old escutcheon; with its large, thrillingview in particularthrilling to a Northerner who stands there for thefirst time. Filled as I am, in general, while there, my friend hadsaid, with the sadness and sorrow of the South, I never, at Charleston,look out to the old betrayed Forts without feeling my heart harden againto steel. One remembered that, on the spot, and one waited a littletosee what was happening to ones heart. I found this to take time indeed;everything differed, somehow, from ones old conceived imageor if I hadanciently grasped the remoteness of Fort Sumter, near the mouth of theBay, and of its companion, at the point of the shore forming the otherside of the passage, this lucidity had so left me, in the course of theyears, that the far-away dimness of the consecrated objects was almost ashock. It was a blow even to ones faded vision of Charleston viciouslyfiring on the Flag; the Flag would have been, from the Battery, such amere speck in space that the vice of the act lost somehow, with thedistance, to say nothing of the forty years, a part of its grossness.The smitten face, however flushed and scarred, was out of sight, thoughthe intention of smiting and the force of the insult were of coursestill the same. This reflection one made, but the old fanciedperspective and proportions were altered; and then the whole picture, atthat hour, exhaled an innocence. It was as blank as the face of a childunder mention of his naughtiness and his punishment of week before last.The Forts, faintly blue on the twinkling sea, looked like vague marineflowers; innocence, pleasantness ruled the prospect: it was as if thecompromised slate, sponged clean of all the wicked words and hung up onthe wall for better use, dangled there so vacantly as almost to lookfoolish. Ah, there again was the word: the air still just tasted of theantique folly; so that in presence of a lesson so sharp and soprolonged, of the general _sterilized_ state, of the brightly-lighted,delicate dreariness recording the folly, harshness was conjured away.There was that in the impression which affected me after a little as oneof those refinements of irony that wait on deep expiations: one couldscarce conceive at this time of day that such a place had ever beendangerously moved. It was the _bled_ condition, and mostly the depletedcerebral condition, that was thus attestedas I had recognized it atRichmond; and I asked myself, on the Battery, what more ones sternestjustice could have desired. If my heart wasnt to harden to steel, inshort, access to it by the right influence had found perhaps too manyother forms of sensibility in ambush.To justify hardness, moreover, one would have had to meet somethinghard; and if my peregrination, after this, had been a search for such anelement, I should have to describe it as made all in vain. Up and downand in and out, with my companion, I strolled from hour to hour; butmore and more under the impression of the consistency of softness. Onecould have expressed the softness in a word, and the picture so offeredwould be infinitely touching. It was a city of gardens and absolutely ofno menor of so few that, save for the general sweetness, the War mightstill have been raging and all the manhood at the front. The gardenswere matter for the women; though even of the women there were few, andthat small companyrare, discreet, flitting figures that brushed thegarden walls with noiseless skirts in the little melancholy streets ofinterspaced, overtangled abodeswere clad in a rigour of mourning thatwas like the garb of a conspiracy. The effect was superficially prim,but so far as it savoured of malice prepense, of the Southern, thesentimental _parti-pris_, it was delightful. What was it all most like,the incoherent jumble of suggestions?the suggestion of a socialshrinkage and an economic blight unrepaired, irreparable; the suggestionof by-ways of some odd far East infected with triumphant womens rights,some perspective of builded, plastered lanes over the enclosures ofwhich the flowering almond drops its petals into sharp deep bands ofshade or of sun. It is not the muffled ladies who walk aboutpredominantly in the East; but that is a detail. The likeness wasperhaps greater to some little old-world quarter of quiet convents whereonly priests and nuns steal forththe priests mistakable at a distance,say, for the nuns. It was indeed thoroughly mystifying, the wholepicturesince I was to get, in the freshness of that morning, from thevery background of the scene, my quite triumphant little impression ofthe old South. I remember feeling with intensity at two or threepoints in particular that I should never get a better one, that eventhis was precariousmight melt at any moment, by a wrong touch or afalse note, in my graspand that I must therefore make the most of it.The rest of my time, I may profess, was spent in so doing. I made themost of it in several successive spots: under the south wall of St.Michaels Church, the sweetest corner of Charleston, and of which thereis more to say; out in the old Cemetery on the edge of the lagoon, wherethe distillation of the past was perhaps clearest and the bribe totenderness most effective; and even not a little on ground thereuntoalmost adjacent, that of a kindly Country Club installed in a fine oldsemi-sinister mansion, and holding an afternoon revel at which I wasprivileged briefly to assist. The wrong touch and the false note weredoubtless just sensible in this last connection, where the question,probed a little, would apparently have been of some new South that hasnot yet quite found the effective way romantically, or at leastinsidiously, to appeal. The South that is cultivating country-clubs is aSouth presumably, in many connections, quite in the right; whereas theone we were invidiously after was the one that had been so utterly inthe wrong. Even there, none the less, in presence of more than a singlemarked sign of the rude Northern contagion, I disengaged, sociallyspeaking, a faint residuum which I mention for proof of the intensity ofmy quest and of my appreciation.There were two other places, I may add, where one could but work theimpression for all it was, in the modern phrase, worth, and where Ihad, I may venture to say, the sense of making as much of it as waslikely ever to be made again. Meanings without end were to be read,under tuition, into one of these, which was neither more nor less thana slightly shy, yet after all quite serene place of refection, aluncheon-room or tea-house, denominated for quaint reasons anExchange_the_ very Exchange in fact lately commemorated in apenetrating study, already much known to fame, of the little that isleft of the local society. My tuition, at the hands of my ingeniouscomrade, was the very best it was possible to have. Nothing, usually,is more wonderful than the quantity of significant character that,with such an example set, the imagination may recognize in thescantest group of features, objects, persons. I fantastically feastedhere, at my luncheon-table, not only, as the genius of the placedemanded, on hot chocolate, sandwiches and Lady Baltimore cake (thislast a most delectable compound), but on the exact _nuance_ of oddity,of bravery, of reduced gentility, of irreducible superiority, to whichthe opening of such an establishment, without derogation, by the prouddaughters of war-wasted families, could exquisitely testify. Theyhovered, the proud impoverished daughters, singly or in couples,behind the countera counter, again, delectably charged; they waited,inscrutably, irreproachably, yet with all that peculiarly chaste_bonhomie_ of the Southern tone, on the customers wants, even comingto ascertain these at the little thrifty tables; and if the drama andits adjusted theatre really contained all the elements of history,tragedy, comedy, irony, that a pair of expert romancers, closelyassociated for the hour, were eager to evoke, the scene would havebeen, I can only say, supreme of its kind. That desire of the artistto linger where the breath of a subject, faintly stirring the air,reaches his vigilant sense, would here stay my stepsas this veryinfluence was in fact, to his great good fortune, to stay those of mycompanion. The charm I speak of, the charm to cherish, however, wasmost exhaled for me in other conditionsconditions that scarce permitof any direct reference to their full suggestiveness. If I alludedabove to the vivid Charleston background, where its mystificationmost scenically persists, the image is all rounded and complete, formemory, in this connection at whichas the case is of an admirablymature and preserved interiorI can only glance as I pass. Thepuzzlement elsewhere is in the sense that though the elements of earthand air, the colour, the tone, the light, the sweetness in fine,linger on, the old South could have had no such unmitigatedmildness, could never have seen itself as subject to such strangefeminization. The feminization is there just to promote for us someeloquent antithesis; just to make us say that whereas the ancientorder was masculine, fierce and moustachioed, the present is at themost a sort of sick lioness who has so visibly parted with her teethand claws that we may patronizingly walk all round her.This image really gives us the best word for the general effect ofCharlestonthat of the practically vacant cage which used in the othertime to emit sounds, even to those of the portentous shaking of bars,audible as far away as in the listening North. It is the vacancy that isa thing by itself, a thing that makes us endlessly wonder. How, in an atall complex, a great political, society, can _everything_ so havegone?assuming indeed that, under this aegis, very much ever had come.How can everything so have gone that the only Southern book of anydistinction published for many a year is _The Souls of Black Folk_, bythat most accomplished of members of the negro race, Mr. W. E. B. DuBois? Had the _only_ focus of life then been Slavery?from the pointonward that Slavery had reached a quarter of a century before the War,so that with the extinction of that interest none other of any sort wasleft. To say yes seems the only way to account for the degree of thevacancy, and yet even as I form that word I meet as a reproach the faceof the beautiful old house I just mentioned, whose ample spaces had sounmistakably echoed to the higher amenities that one seemed to feel theaccumulated traces and tokens gradually come out of their corners likeblest objects taken one by one from a reliquary worn with much handling.The note of such haunted chambers as thesehaunted structurally, aboveall, quite as by the ghost of the grand stylewas not, certainly, athinness of reverberation; so that I had to take refuge here in the factthat everything appeared thoroughly to _antedate_, to refer itself tothe larger, the less vitiated past that had closed a quarter of acentury or so before the War, before the fatal time when the South,mono-maniacal at the parting of the ways, elected for extension andconquest. The admirable old house of the stately hall and staircase, ofthe charming coved and vaulted drawing-room, of the precious mahoganydoors, the tall unsophisticated portraits, the delicate dignity ofwelcome, owed nothing of its noble identity, nothing at all appreciable,to the monomania. However that might be, moreover, I kept finding themere melancholy charm reassert itself where it couldthe charm, I mean,of the flower-crowned waste that was, by my measure, what the monomaniahad most prepared itself to bequeathe. In the old Cemetery by thelagoon, to which I have already alluded, this influence distils anirresistible poetryas one has courage to say even in remembering howdisproportionately, almost anywhere on the American scene, the generalplace of interment is apt to be invited to testify for the presence ofcharm. The golden afternoon, the low, silvery, seaward horizon, as ofwide, sleepy, game-haunted inlets and reed-smothered banks, possiblesite of some Venice that had never mustered, the luxury, in the mildair, of shrub and plant and blossom that the pale North can butdistantly envy; something that I scarce know how to express but as theproud humility of the whole idle, easy loveliness, made even therestless analyst, for the hour, among the pious inscriptions that scarceever belie the magniloquent clime or the inimitable tradition, feelhimself really capable of the highest Carolinian pitch.To what height did he rise, on the other hand, on being introducedanother day, at no great distance from this point, and where the silveryseaward outlook still prevails, to the lapsed and readministeredresidence, also already named, that was to give him his one glimpse ofany local modernism? This was the nearest approach for him to anyreanimation of the flower-crowned waste, and he has still in memory, forsymbol of the modernism, a vision of the great living, blazing fire oflogs round which, as the afternoon had turned wet and chill, thiscontribution to his view of a possible new society, a possible youthfultone, a possible Southern future in short, had disposed itself. Therewere men here, in the picturea few, and young ones: that odd othersense as of a becraped, feminized world was accordingly for the momentin abeyance. For the moment, I say advisedlyfor the moment only; sincewhat aspect of the social scene anywhere in the States strikes anysecond glance as exempt from that condition? It is overwhelminglyfeminized or it _is_ notthat is the formula with which its claim toexistence pierces the ear. Lest, however, the recognition again of thistruth should lead me too far, I content myself with noting a matterperhaps more relevant just hereones inevitable consciousness, inpresence of the new manifestations, that the South is in thepredicament of having to be tragic, as it were, in order to beguile. Itwas very hard, I said to myself, and very cruel and very perverse, andabove all very strange; but what use had the restless analyst here fora lively and oblivious type? Was there not something in the lively andoblivious that, given the materials employed for it and the effectproduced by it, threw one back with renewed relish on the unforgettingand the devoted, on the resentful and even, if need might be, thevindictive? These things would represent certainly a bad _tatdme_and was one thus cold-bloodedly, critically, to wish such acondition perpetuated? The answer to that seemed to be, monstrouslyenough, Well, yesfor these people; since it appears the only way bywhich they can be interesting. See when they try other ways! Theirsadness and sorrow, as my friend called it, has at least for it that ithas been expensively produced. Everything else, on the other hand,anything that may pretend to be betteroh, so cheaply!One had already, in moving about, winced often enough at sight of whereone was, intellectually, to land, under these last consistencies ofobservation and reflection; so I may put it here that I _didnt_, afterall, land, but recoiled rather and forbore, making my skiff fast to noconclusion whatever, only pushing out again and letting it, for asupreme impression and to prepare in the aftertime the best remembrance,drift where it would. So, accordingly, the aftertime having a littlearrived, it touches now once more of its own motion, carries me back andputs me ashore on the one spot where the impression had been perfectlyfelicitous. I have already named the placeunder the mild, the brightsouth wall of St. Michaels Church, where the whole precinct offered thefull-blown Southern spring, that morning, the finest of all canvases toembroider. The canvas here, yes, was of the best; not only didCharleston show me none other so good, but I was doubtless to have met,South or North, none of an equal happy grain and form. The high,complicated, inflated spire of the church has the sincerity, approved oftime, that is so rare, over the land, in the work of mans hands, ladenthough these be with the millions he offers as a vain bribe to it; andin the sweet old churchyard ancient authority seemed to me, on theoccasion of my visit, to sit, among the sun-warmed tombs and theinterrelated slabs and the extravagant flowers, as on the sole cushionthe general American bareness in such connections had left it. There wasmore still of association and impression; I found, under this charm, Iconfess, character in every feature. Even in the much-maintainedinterior revolutions and renovations have respected its sturdy, rathersombre essence: the place feels itself, in the fine old dusky archaicway, the constituted temple of a faithachieves, in a word, the air ofreality that one had seen in every other such case, from town to townand from village to village, missed with an unconsciousness that had todo duty for success.                                  XIV                                FLORIDA                                   IIt is the penalty of the state of receiving too many impressions of toomany things that when the question arises of giving some account ofthese a small sharp anguish attends the act of selection and thenecessity of omission. They have so hung together, have so almostequally contributed, for the fond critic, to the total image, thechapter of experience, whatever such may have been, that to detach andreject is like mutilation or falsification; the history of any givenimpression residing often largely in others that have led to it oraccompanied it. This I find the case, again and again, with my Americanmemories; there was something of a hundred of those I may not note ineach of those I may, and I feel myself, amid the swarm, pluck but afruit or two from any branch. When I think of Florida, for instance, Ithink of twenty matters involved in the start and the approach; I thinkof the moist, the slightly harsh, Sunday morning under the portico ofthe Charleston Hotel; I think of the inauspicious drizzle about theyellow omnibus, archaic and provincial, that awaited the departingguestsremembering how these antique vehicles, repudiated, ricketystages of the age ignorant of trolleys, affected me here and there asthe quaintest, most immemorial of American things, the persistent use ofwhich surely represented the very superstition of the past. I think ofthe gentleman, in the watchful knot, who, while our luggage emerged, wasmoved to say to me, for some reason, I guess we manage our travellinghere better than in _your_ country!whereby he so easily triumphed,blank as I had to remain as to the country he imputed to me. I think ofthe inimitable detachment with which, at the very moment he spoke, thenegro porter engaged at the door of the conveyance put straight downinto the mud of the road the dressing-bag I was obliged, a few minuteslater, in our close-pressed company, to nurse on my knees; and I go sofar, even, as almost to lose myself in the sense of other occasionsevoked by that reminiscence; this marked anomaly, the apparentlydeep-seated inaptitude of the negro race at large for any alertness ofpersonal service, having been throughout a lively surprise.One had counted, with some eagerness, in moving southward, on thevirtual oppositeon finding this deficiency, encountered right and leftat the North, beautifully corrected; one had remembered the old Southerntradition, the house alive with the scramble of young darkies for thehonour of fetching and carrying; and one was to recognize, no doubt, atthe worst, its melancholy ghost. Its very ghost, however, by myimpression, had ceased to walk; or, if this be not the case, the oldplanters, the cotton gentry, were the people in the world the worstministered to. I could have shed tears for them at moments, reflectingthat it was for _this_ they had fought and fallen. The negro waiter atthe hotel is in general, by an oddity of his disposition, so zealous tobreak for you two or three eggs into a tumbler, or to drop for you threeor four lumps of sugar into a coffee-cup, that he scarce waits, ineither case, for your leave; but these struck me everywhere as the limitof his accomplishment. He lends himself sufficiently to the rough,gregarious bustle of crowded feeding-places, but seemed to fall belowthe occasion on any appeal to his individual promptitude. Whichreflections, doubtless, exactly illustrate my profession of a moment agoas to the insidious continuity, the close inter-relation, of observedphenomena. I might with a little audacity insist still further onthatwhich was in fact what I had originally quite promised myself todo. I certainly should have been half heart-broken at the hour itself,for example, had I _then_ had to estimate as pure waste my state ofsensibility to the style and stamp of my companions; aspects and soundsburned into my memory, as I find, but none the less overstraining, I amobliged to feel, the frame of these remarks. So vivid on the spot wasthe sense of these particular human and sectional appearances, and ofcertain others of the same cluster, that they remained for me afterwardsbeautifully _placed_placed in this connection of the pilgrimage to PalmBeach, and not the less relevant for being incidental. I was to find theobvious bagman, the lusty drummer of the Southern trains and inns(if there be not, as yet unrevealed to me, some later fond diminutive ofdesignation for the ubiquitous commercial traveller)I was to find, Isay, this personage promptly insist on a category of his own, a categorywhich, at the moments I here recall, loomed so large as to threaten toblock out of view almost every other object.Was I the victim of grave mischance? was my infelicity exceptional?orwas the type with which the scene so abounded, were the specimens I wasthus to treasure, all of the common class and the usual frequency? I wasto treasure them as specimens of something I had surely never yet so_undisputedly_ encountered. They went, all by themselves, as it were, sofarwere, as to facial character, vocal tone, primal rawness of speech,general accent and attitude, extraordinarily base and vulgar; and it wasinteresting to make out why this fact took on, for my edification, sounwonted an intensity. The fact of the influence, on the whole man, of asordid and ravenous habit, was naturally no new thing; one had met himenough about the world, the brawny peddler more or less gorged with thefruits of misrepresentation and blatant and brazen in the key of hisspecial line of goods and the measure of his need. But if the figurewas immemorial, why did it now usurp a value out of proportion to othervalues? What, for instance, were its remorseless reasons for treatingthe restless analyst, at the breakfast-hour perhaps above all, to solurid a vision of its triumph? He had positively come to associate thebreakfast-hour, from hotel to dining-car and from dining-car to hotel,with the perfect security of this exhibition, the sight of the type incompletely unchallenged possession. I scarce know why my sensibility, atthe juncture in question, so utterly gave way to it; why I appealed invain from one of these so solemnly-feeding presences to another. Theyrefused to the wondering mind any form of relief; they insisted, as Isay, with the strange crudity of their air of commercial truculence, onbeing exactly as low as they liked. And the affirmation was made, inthe setting of the great greasy inelegant room, as quietly as possible,and without the least intention of offence: there were ladies andchildren all aboutthough indeed there may have been sometimes _but_ thelone breakfasting child to reckon with; the little pale, carnivorous,coffee-drinking ogre or ogress who prowls down in advance of its elders,engages a tabledread vision!and has the run of the bill of fare.The great blank decency, at all events, was no more broken than, on thegeneral American scene, it ever is; yet the apprehension of marks andsigns, the trick of speculation, declined none the less to drop. Whomwere they constructed, such specimens, to talk with, to talk over, or totalk under, and what form of address or of intercourse, what uttered,what intelligible terms of introduction, of persuasion, of menace, whatdeveloped, what specific human process of any sort, was it possible toimpute to them? What reciprocities did they imply, what presumptions didthey, could they, create? What happened, inconceivably, when such Greeksmet such Greeks, such faces looked into such faces, and such sounds, inespecial, were exchanged with such sounds? What women did they livewith, what women, living with them, could yet leave them as they were?What wives, daughters, sisters, did they in fine make credible; andwhat, in especial, was the speech, what the manners, what the generaldietary, what most the monstrous morning meal, of ladies receiving atsuch hands the law or the licence of life? Questions, these latter, someof which, all the while, were not imperceptibly answeredsave that thevainest, no doubt, was that baffled inquiry as to the thinkable ground,amid such relations, of preliminary confidence. What _was_ preliminaryconfidence, where it had to reckon so with the minimum of any finishedappearance? How, when people were like that, did any one trust any oneenough to begin, or understand any one enough to go on, or keep thepeace with any one enough to survive? Wasnt it, however, at last, nonethe less, the sign of a fallacy somewhere in my impression that thepeace _was_ kept, precisely, while I so luxuriously wondered?theconsciousness of which presently led me round to something that was atthe least a temporary, a working answer. My friends the drummers bore mecompany thus, in the smoking-car, through the deepening, sweeteningSouth (where the rain soon gave way to a refinement of mildness) all theway to Savannah; at the end of which time, under the enchantment of thespreading scene, I had more or less issued from my maze.It was not, probably, that, inflated though they might be, after earlyrefreshment, with the inward conflict of a greater number of strangesacrifices to appetite than I had ever before seen perpetrated at once,they were really more gruesome examples of a class at best disquietingthan might elsewhere have been discovered; it was only that, by so sad alaw of their situation, they were at once more exposed and lesssusceptible of bearing exposure. They so became, to my imagination, andby a mere turn of the hand of that precious faculty, something likevictims and martyrs, creatures touchingly, tragically doomed. For theyhadnt _asked_, when one reflected, to be almost the only figures in thesocial landscapehadnt wanted the fierce light to beat _all_ onthemselves. They hadnt actively usurped the appearance of carrying onlife without aid of any sort from other _kinds_ of persons, other types,presences, classes. If these others were absent it wasnt _their_ fault;and though they devoured, at a matutinal sitting, thirty little saucersof insane, of delirious food, this was yet a law which, over much of theland, appeared to recognize no difference of application for age, sex,condition or constitution, and it had not in short been their pretensionto take over the whole social case. It would have been so different,this case, and the general effect, for the human scene, would have beenso different, with a due proportion of other presences, other figuresand characters, members of other professions, representatives of otherinterests, exemplars of other possibilities in man than the merepossibility of getting the better of his fellow-man over a trade.Wondrous always to note is this sterility of aspect and this blight ofvulgarity, humanly speaking, where a single type has had the game, asone may say, all in its hands. Character is developed to visiblefineness only by friction and discipline on a large scale, only by itshaving to reckon with a complexity of forcesa process which results, atthe worst, in a certain amount of social training.No kind of personthat was the admonitionis a very good kind, and stillless a very pleasing kind, when its education has not been made to someextent by contact with other kinds, by a sense of the existence of otherkinds, and, to that degree, by a certain relation with them. Thiseducation may easily, at a hundred points, transcend the teaching of thebig brick school-house, for all the latters claim to universality. Thelast dose ever administered by the great wooden spoon so actively plied_there_ is the precious bitter-sweet of a sense of proportion; yet tomiss that taste, ever, at the table of civilization is to feel ourselvesseated surely too much below the salt. We miss it when the social effectof it failswhen, all so dismally or so monstrously, every one strikesus as after but one thing, and as thus not only unaware of the absentimportances and values, but condemned and restricted, as a directconsequence of it, to the mere raw stage of their own particularconnection. I so worked out, in a word, that what was the matter with myfriends was not at all that they were viciously full-blown, as one mightsay, were the ultimate sort of monstrosity they had at first appeared;but that they were, on the contrary, just unformed, undeveloped,unrelated above allunrelated to any merciful modifying terms of thegreat social proposition. They were not in their placenot relegated,shaded, embowered, protected; and, dreadful though this might be to astray observer of the fact, it was much more dreadful for themselves.They had the helpless weakness and, I think even, somewhere in dimdepths, deeper down still than the awful breakfast-habit, the vaguelytroubled sense of it. They would fall into their place at a touch, werethe social proposition, as I have called it, completed; they would thenhelp, quite subordinately assist, the long sentence to readrelieved oftheir ridiculous charge of supplying all its clauses. I positively atlast thought of them as appealing from this embarrassment; in whichsublime patience I was floated, as I say, to Savannah.                                   IIAfter that it was plain sailing; in the sense, I mean, of therespitetemporary at leastof speculation; of feeling impressions filein and seat themselves as quietly as decorous worshippers (say mild oldladies with neat prayer-books) taking possession of some long-drawnfamily pew. It was absurd what I made of Savannahwhich consisted for mebut of a quarter of an hours pause of the train under the wide arch ofthe station, where, in the now quite confirmed blandness of the Sundaynoon, a bright, brief morning party appeared of a sudden to haveorganized itself. Where was the charm?if it wasnt already, supremely,in the air, the latitude, the season, as well as in the imagination ofthe pilgrim capable not only of squeezing a sense from the importantcity on these easy terms and with that desperate economy, but of readingheaven knows what instalment of romance into a mere railroad matter. Itis a mere railroad matter, in the States, that a station should appearat a given moment to yield to the invasion of a dozen or so ofbareheaded and vociferous young women in the company of young men tomatch, and that they should all treat the place, in the public eye, thatof the crowded contemplative cars, quite as familiar, domestic, intimateground, set apart, it might be, for the discussion and regulation oftheir little interests and affairs, and for that so oddly, so innocentlyimmodest ventilation of their puerile privacies at which the moralizingvisitor so frequently gasps. I recall my fleeting instants of Savannahas the taste of a cup charged to the brim; I recall the swarming, thehatless, pretty girls, with their big-bowed cues, their romping swains,their inveterate suggestion of their having more to say about Americanmanners than any other single class; I recall the thrill produced by thehawkers of scented Southern things, sprigs and specimens of flower andfruit that mightnt as yet be of the last exoticism, but that werenative and fresh and over-priced, and so all that the traveller couldask.But most of all, I think, I recall the quite lively resolve not to giveway, under the assault of the beribboned and shirt-waisted fair, tothe provocation of _their_ suggestivenesseven as I had fallen,reflectively speaking, straight into the trap set for me by theCharleston bagmen; a resolve taken, I blush to say, as a base economicprecaution only, and not because the spectacle before me failed to makereflections swarm. They fairly hummed, my suppressed reflections, in themanner of bees about a flower-bed, and burying their noses as deep inthe _coroll_ of the subject. Had I allowed myself time before the trainresumed its direction, I should have thus found myself regarding theyouths and the maidensbut especially, for many reasons, themaidensquite in the light of my so earnestly-considered drummers, quiteas creatures extraordinarily disconcerting, at first, as to the wholematter of their public behaviour, but covered a little by the mantle ofcharity as soon as it became clear that what, like the poor drummers,they suffer from, is the tragedy of their social, their cruel exposure,that treachery of fate which has kept them so out of their place. It wasa case, I more than ever saw, like the case of the bagmen; the case ofthe bagmen lighted it here, in the most interesting way, by propinquityand coincidence. If the bagmen had seemed monstrous, in their occupancyof the scene, by their disproportioned possession of it, so was not thehint sufficient that this also explains much of the effect of theAmerican girl as encountered in the great glare of her publicity, heruncorrected, unrelated state? There had been moments, as I moved aboutthe country, when she had seemed to me, for affirmation of presence, forimmunity from competition, fairly to share the field but with thebagman, and fairly to speak as my inward ear had at last heard himspeak.Ah, once _place_ me and youll seeI shall be different, I shall bebetter; for since I am, with my preposterous position, falselybeguiled, pitilessly forsaken, thrust forth in my ignorance and folly,what do I know, helpless chit as I can but be, about manners or tone,about proportion or perspective, about modesty or mystery, about acondition of things that involves, for the interest and the grace oflife, other forms of existence than this poor little minepatheticallybroken reed as it is, just to find itself waving all alone in the wind?How can I do _all_ the grace, _all_ the interest, as Im expectedto?yes, literally all the interest that isnt the mere interest on themoney. Im expected to supply it allwhile I wander and stray in thedesert. Was there ever such a conspiracy, on the part of a whole socialorder, toward the exposure of incompetence? Were ever crude youth andcrude presumption left so unadmonished as to their danger of givingthemselves away? Who, at any turn, for an hour, ever pityinglyovershadows or dispossesses me? By what combination of other presencesever am I disburdened, ever relegated and reduced, ever restored, in aword, to my right relation to the whole? All I wantthat is all I need,for there is perhaps a differenceis, to put it simply, that my parentsand my brothers and my male cousins should consent to exist otherwisethan occultly, undiscoverably, or, as I suppose youd call it,irresponsibly. Thats a trouble, yesbut we take it, so why shouldntthey? The restdont you make it out for me?would come of itself.Havent I, however, as it is, been too long abandoned and too _much_betrayed? Isnt it too late, and am I not, dont you think, practicallylost? Faintly and from far away, as through dense interpositions, thisquestioning wail of the maidens ultimate distressed consciousnessseemed to reach me; but I had steeled my sense, as I have said, againsttaking it in, and I did no more, at the moment, than all pensivelysuffer it again to show me the American social order in the guise of agreat blank unnatural mother, a compound of all the recreant individualsmisfitted with the name, whose ear the mystic plaint seemed never topenetrate, and whose large unseeing complacency suggested some massivemonument covered still with the thick cloth that precedes a publicunveiling. We wonder at the hidden marble or bronze; we suppose, underthe cloth, some attitude or expression appropriate to the image; but asthe removal of the cloth is perpetually postponed the character neveremerges. The American mother, enshrouded in her brown holland, has, bythis analogy, never emerged; only the daughter is meanwhile seated, forthe inspection of the world, at the base of the pedestal, hypotheticallysupporting some weight, some mass or other, and we may each impute toher, for this posture, the aspect we judge best to beseem her.My point here, at any rate, is that I had quite forgotten her by thetime I was seated, after dinner that evening, on a bench in the smallpublic garden that formed a prospect for my hotel at Jacksonville. Theair was divinely softit was such a Southern night as I had dreamed of;and the only oddity was that we had come to it by so simple a process.We had travelled indeed all day, but the process seemed simple whenthere was nothing of it, nothing to speak of, to remember, nothing thatsucceeded in getting over the footlights, as the phrase goes, of thegreat moving proscenium of the Pullman. I seemed to think of it, thewayside imagery, as something that had been there, no doubt, as theaction or the dialogue are presumably there in some untoward drama thatspends itself at the back of the stage, that goes off, in a passion, atside doors, and perhaps even bursts back, incoherently, through windows;but that doesnt reach the stall in which you sit, never quickens toacuteness your sense of what is going on. So, as if the chair in thePullman had been my stall, my sense had been all day but of interveningheads and tuning fiddles, of queer refreshments, such as only thetheatre and the Pullman know, offered, with vociferation, straightthrough the performance. I was a little uncertain, afterwards, as towhen I had become distinctively aware of Florida; but the scenery of theState, up to the point of my first pause for the night, had not got overthe footlights. I was promptly, however, to make good this loss; I feltmyself doing so quite with intensity under the hot-looking stars atJacksonville. I had come out to smoke for the evenings end, and itmattered not a scrap that the public garden was new and scant and crude,and that Jacksonville is not a name to conjure with; I still could sitthere quite in the spirit, for the hour, of Byrons immortal question asto the verity of his Italian whereabouts: _was_ this the Mincio, _were_those the distant turrets of Verona, and should I supwell, if the trainto Palm Beach, arriving there on the morrow in time, should happen topermit me? At Jacksonville I had, as I say, already supped, but Iprojected myself, for the time, after Byrons manner, into the exquisitesense of the dream come true.I was not to sup at all, as it proved, at Palm Beachby the operation ofone of those odd, anomalous rigours that crop up even by the moreflowery paths of American travel; but I was meanwhile able, I found, tobe quite Byronically foolish about the St. Johns River and the variousstructures, looming now through the darkness, that more or less adornedits banks. The river served for my Minciowhich it moreover so greatlysurpassed in extent and beauty; while the remoter buildings figuredsufficiently any old city of the South. For that was the charmthat sopreposterously, with the essential notes of the impression so happilystruck, the velvet air, the extravagant plants, the palms, the oranges,the cacti, the architectural fountain, the florid local monument, thecheap and easy exoticism, the sense as of people feeding, off in thebackground, very much _al fresco_, that is on queer things and withflaring lightsone might almost have been in a corner of Naples or ofGenoa. Everything is relativethis illuminating commonplace, the clue toany just perception of effects anywhere, came up for the thousandthtime; by the aid of which I easily made out that absolute and impeccablepoetry of site and circumstance is far to seek, but that I was nowimmeasurably nearer to some poetic, or say even to some romantic, effectin things than I had hitherto been. And I had tried to think Washingtonrelaxed, and Richmond itself romantic, and Charleston secretly ardent!There always comes, to any traveller who doesnt depart and arrive withthe mere security and punctuality of a registered letter, some momentfor his beginning to feel within himit happens under some particulartouchthe finer vibration of a sense of the real thing. He thus knows itwhen it comes, and it has the great value that it never need fail. Thereis no situation, wherever he may turn, in which the note of thatespecial reality, the note of character, for bliss or bale, may notinsist on emerging. The note of Florida emerged for me then on thevulgar little duskyand dustyJacksonville _piazzetta_, where othervague persons sat about, amid those spikey sub-tropical things that showhow the South can be stiff as nothing else is stiff; while my rich senseof it incited me to resent the fact that my visit had been denounced, inadvance, as of an ungenerous brevity. I had few days, deplorably few, nodoubt, to spend; but it was afterwards positive to me that, with myimage, as regards the essence of the matter, richly completed, I hadvirtually foretasted it all on my dusky Jacksonville bench and in mytepid Jacksonville stroll. Such reserves, in a complex of fewinterweavings, must impose themselves, I think, even upon foolishfondness, and Florida was quite remorselessly to appear to me a complexof few interweavings.                                  IIIThe next day, for instance, was all occupied with but one of these; therailway run from Jacksonville to Palm Beach begins early and ends late,yet I waited, the livelong time, for any other factor than that of thedense cypress swamp to show so much as the tip of an ear. I had quitecounted on being thrilled by this very intensity and monotony of thecharacteristic note; and I doubtless was thrilledI invoked, Icultivated the thrill, as we went, by every itinerant art thatexperience had long since taught me; yet with a presentiment, all thewhile, of the large field, in the whole impression, that this simplicitywould cover. Possible diversions doubtless occurred, had the attunedspirit been moved to avail itself; Ormond, for instance, off to ourright, put in, toward the dim centre of the stretch, a claim as large asa hard white racing-beach, an expanse of firm sand thirty miles long,could make it. This, I recognized, might well be an appeal of the grandand simple orderthe huge band of shining silver beside the huge band ofsapphire sea; and I inquired a little as to what filled in the picture.Oh, the motor-cars, the bicycles and the trotting-waggons, tearing upand down. And then, as one seemed perhaps to yearn for another touch:Ah, the hotels of courseplenty of _them_, plenty of people; verypopular resort. It sounded charming, with its hint again of two orthree great facts of compositionso definite that their paucityconstituted somehow a mild majesty; but it ministered none the less to areflection I had already, on occasion, found myself perhaps a littleperversely making. One was liable, in the States, on many a scene, toreact, as it were, from the people, and to throw ones self passionatelyon the bosom of contiguous Nature, whatever surface it might happen tooffer; one was apt to be moved, in possibly almost invidious preference,or in deeper and sweeter confidence, to try what might be made of_that_. Yet, all unreasonably, when any source of interest did expressitself in these mere rigorous terms, in these onlyterms all ofelimination, just of sea and sky and river-breast and forest and beach(the beaches in especial were to acquire a trick of getting on onesnerves!) that produced in turn a wanton wonder about the human side,and a due recurrence to the fact that the human side had been from thefirst ones affair.So, therefore, one seemed destined a bit incoherently to proceed; askingones self again and again what the play would have been without thescenery, sometimes even such scenery, and then once more not quiteseeing why such scenery (in especial) should propose to put one off withso little of a play. The thing, absolutely, everywhere, was to provideones own play; anything, everything made scenery for that, and therecurrence of such questions made scenery most of all. I remember nomoment, over the land, when the mere Pullman itself didnt overarch myobservations as a positive temple of the drama, and when the comedy andthe tragedy of manners didnt, under its dome, hold me raptly attent.With which there were other resourcesa rising tide that, before we gotto Palm Beach, floated me back into remembered depths of youth. Whyshouldnt I hold it not trivial that, as the day waned, and the eveninggathered, and the heat increased, and my companions removed, one afterthe other, the articles of clothing that had consorted with our earlystart, I felt myself again beneath the spell of Mayne Reid, captain ofthe treasure-ship of romance and idol of my childhood? I might againhave held in my very hand _The War Trail_, a work that had seemedmatchless to my fourteenth year, for was not the train itself rumblingstraight into _that_ fantastic Florida, with its rank vegetation and itswarm, heroic, amorous air?the Florida of the Seminoles and theEverglades, of the high old Spanish Dons and the passionate Creolebeauties gracing the primal society; of Isolina de Vargas, whosevoluptuous form was lashed Mazeppa-like, at the climax of her fortunes,to the fiery mustang of the wilderness, and so let loose adown theendless vista of our young suspense. We had thus food for the mind, Irecall, if we were reduced to that; and I remember that, as mybuffet-car (there was none other) was hours late, the fond vision of themeal, crown of the endless day, awaiting me ultimately at the famoushotel, yielded all the inspiration necessary for not appealing again,great though the stress and strain, to the indescribable charity of thebuffet. The produce of the buffet, the procedure of the buffet, werealike (wherever resorted to) a sordid mockery of desire; so I butsuffered desire to accumulate till the final charming arrest, theplatform of the famous hotel, amid generous lights and greetings, andexcellent arrangements, and balmy Southern airs, and the breath of thenear sea, and the vague crests of great palms, announced the fulfilmentof every hope.The question of whether ones hope was really fulfilled, or of whetherone had, among all those items of ease, to go supperless to bed, woulddoubtless appear beneath the dignity of even such history as this, wereit not for a single factwhich, then and there looming large to me,blocked out, on the spot, all others. It is difficult to render theintensity with which one felt the great sphere of the hotel close roundone, covering one in as with high, shining crystal walls, stretchingbeneath ones feet an immeasurable polished level, revealing itself inshort as, for the time, for the place, the very order of nature and thevery form, the only one, of the habitable world. The effect was likenothing else of the sort one had ever known, and of surpassing interest,truly, as any supreme illustration of manners, any complete and organicprojection of a social case is apt to be. The whole picture presenteditself as fresh and luminousas was natural to phenomena shown in thesplendid Florida light and off there at the end of a huge peninsulaespecially appointed to them, and kept clear, in their interest, as itstruck me, of any shadow of anything but themselves. One had been awareenough, certainly, for long years, of that range of American aspects,that diffusion of the American example, to which one had given, from farback, for convenience, the name of hotel-civilization; why, accordingly,was this renewed impression so hugely to impose itself; why was it, tothe eye of the restless analyst, to stand for so much more than everyet? Why was it, above all, so to succeed in making, with insistence,its appeal?an appeal if not to the finer essence of interest, yet toseveral of the fond critics livelier sensibilities. Wasnt, for thatmatter, his asking of such questions as these the very state of beinginterested?and all the more that the general reply to them was not easyto throw off.The vision framed, the reflections suggested, corresponded closely withthose to which, in New York, some weeks before, on its harsh winterafternoon, the Waldorf-Astoria had prescribed such a revel; but it waswondrous that if I had there supposed the apogee of the impression (or,better still, of the expression) reached, I was here to see the wholeeffect written lucidly larger. The difference was doubtless that of thecrowded air and encumbered ground in the great Northern cityin the factthat the demonstration is made in Florida as in a vast clean voidexpressly prepared for it. It has nothing either in nature or in man toreckon withit carries everything before it; meaning, when I say it,in this momentarily indefinite way, the perfect, the exquisiteadjustability of the national life to the sublime hotel-spirit. Thewhole appearance operates as by an economy so thorough that no elementof either party to the arrangement is discoverably sacrificed; neitheris mutilated, docked in any degree of its identity, its amplitude oftype; nothing is left unexpressed in either through its relation withthe other. The relation would in fact seem to stimulate each to a viewof the highest expression as yet open to it. The advantagein the senseof the upper handmay indeed be, at a few points, most with thehotel-spirit, as the more concentrated of the two; there being so muchthat is comparatively undeveloped and passive in the social organism towhich it looks for response, and the former agency, by its very naturefull-blown and expert, trying it on the latter much more than thelatter is ever perceptibly moved to try it on the former. Thehotel-spirit is an omniscient genius, while the character of thetributary nation is still but struggling into relatively dimself-knowledge. An illustration of this met me, precisely, at the veryhour of my alighting: one had entered, toward ten oclock in theevening, the hotel-world; it had become the all in all and made andimposed its law.This took the form, for me, at that hungry climax, at the end of thelong ordeal of the buffet-car, of a refusal of all food that night; arigour so inexorable that, had it not been for the charity of admirablefriends, able to provide me from a private store, I should have had togo, amid all the suggestions of everything, fasting and faint to bed.There one seemed to get the hotel-spirit _taking_ the advantagetakingit unfairly; for whereas it struck me in general as educative,distinctly, in respect to the society it deals with, keeping for themost part well in advance of it, and leading it on to a larger view ofthe social interest and opportunity than might otherwise accrue, here,surely, it was false to its mission, it fell behind its pretension, itsgeneral pretension not only of meeting all American ideals, but ofcreating (the Waldorf-Astoria being in this sense, for example, aperfect riot of creation) new and superior ones. Its basis, in thosehigh developments, is not that it merely gratifies them as soon as theypeep out, but that it lies in wait for them, anticipates and plucks themforth even before they dawn, setting them up almost prematurely andturning their face in the right direction. Thus the great nationalignorance of many things is artfully and benevolently practised upon;thus it is converted into extraordinary appetites, such as can be butexpensively sated. The belated travellers appetite for thelong-deferred bite could scarce be described as _too_ extraordinary;but the great collective, plastic public, so vague yet about manythings, didnt _know_ that it couldnt, didnt know that, in communitiesmore knowing, the great glittering, costly caravansery, where the scaleof charges is an implication of a high refinement of service, gravelapses are not condoned.One appears ridiculously to be regretting that unsupplied mouthful, butthe restless analyst had in truth quickly enough left it behind, feelingin his hand, already, as a clue, the long concatenation of interlinkedappearances. Things short in themselves might yet have such largedimensions of meaning. The revelation, practically dazzling to theuninformed many, was constantly proving, right and left, if one gave ittime, a trick played on the informed few; and there was no quarter ofthe field, either the material or the social, in which that didntsooner or later come out. The fact that the individual, with hispreferences, differences, habits, accidents, might still fareimperfectly even where the crowd could be noted as rejoicing before theLord more ingenuously than on any other human scene, added but anothertouch to ones impression, already so strong, of the success with which,throughout the land, even in conditions which might appear likely, oncertain sides, to beget reserves about it, the all-gregarious andgeneralized life suffices to every need. I by no means say that it isnot touching, the so largely witless confidence with which the universalimpulse hurls its victims into the abyss of the hotel-spirit, trustingit so blandly and inviting it to throw up, round and about them and farand wide, the habitable, the practicable, the agreeable sphere towardwhich other arts of construction fail. There were lights in which thiswas to strike me as one of the most affecting of all social exhibitions;lights, positively, in which I seemed to see again (as, once more, atthe universal Waldorf-Astoria) the whole housed populace move as in mildand consenting suspicion of its captured and governed state, its havingto consent to inordinate fusion as the price of what it seemed pleasedto regard as inordinate luxury. Beguiled and caged, positively thankful,in its vast vacancy, for the sense and the definite horizon of a cage,were there yet not moments, were there yet not cases and connections, inwhich it still dimly made out that its condition was the result of acompromise into the detail of which there might some day be an alarm inentering? The detail of the compromise exacted of the individual,throughout American life, affects the observer as a great cumulativesum, growing and growing while he awaits time and opportunity to go intoit; and I asked myself again and again if I couldnt imagine the shadowof that quantity by no means oppressively felt, yet already vaguelyperceived, and reflected a bit portentously in certain aspects of thenative consciousness.The jealous cultivation of the common mean, the common mean only, thereduction of everything to an average of decent suitability, the gospelof precaution against the dangerous tendency latent in many things tobecome too good for their context, so that persons partaking of them maybecome too good for their companythe idealized form of all thisglimmered for me, as an admonition or a betrayal, through the charmingFlorida radiance, constituting really the greatest interest of thelesson one had travelled so far to learn. It might superficially seemabsurd, it might savour almost of blasphemy, to put upon the romanticpeninsula the affront of that particular prosaic meaning; but I professthat none of its so sensibly thin sources of romancethin becauseeverywhere asking more of the imagination than they could be detected ingiving itappealed to me with any such force or testified in any suchquantity. Definitely, one had made ones pilgrimage but to find thehotel-spirit in sole _articulate_ possession, and, call this truth forthe mind an anti-climax if one would, none of the various climaxes, theminor effectsthose of Nature, for instance, since thereabouts, far andwide, was no hinted historystruck me as for a moment dispossessing itof supremacy. So little availed, comparatively, those of the jungle, theair, the sea, the sky, the sunset, the orange, the pineapple, the palm;so little such a one, amid all the garden climaxes, as that of thedivine bougainvilla which, here and there, at Palm Beach, smotherswhole homes in its purple splendour. For the light of the hotel-spiritreally beat upon everything; it was the only torch held up for the viewor the sense of anything else. The case, therefore, was perfect, forwhat did this mean but that its conscience, so to speak, its view of itsresponsibility, would be of the highest, and that, given the wholegolden frame of the picture, the appearances could be nowhere else sograndly in its favour? That prevision was to be in fact afterwardsconfirmed to me.                                   IVOn a strip of sand between the sea and the jungle in one quarter,between the sea and the Lake in another, the clustered hotels, thesuperior Pair in especial, stand and exhale their genius. One of them,the larger, the more portentously brave, of the Pair, is a marvelindeed, proclaiming itself of course, with all the eloquence of aninterminable towered and pinnacled and gabled and bannered sky-line, thebiggest thing of its sort in the world. Such is the responsive genialitybegotten by its apparently perfect adequacy to this pretension, or toany other it might care to put forth, that one took it easily as leavingfar behind mere figures of speech and forms of advertisement; to standoff and see it rear its incoherent crest above its gardens was torememberand quite with reliefnothing but the processional outline ofWindsor Castle that could appear to march with it. I say with reliefbecause the value of the whole affirmation, which was but the scaleotherwise expressed, seemed thereby assured: no world _but_ anhotel-world could flourish in such a shadow. Every step, for a mile ortwo round, conduced but to show how it did flourish; every aspect ofeverything for which our reclaimed patch, our liberal square between seaand jungle, yielded space, was a demonstration of that. The gardens andgroves, the vistas and avenues between the alignments of palms, thefostered insolence of flame-coloured flower and golden fruit, wereperhaps the rarest attestation of all; so recent a conquest did thisseem to me of ground formerly abandoned, in the States, to the generalindifference. There came back to me from other years a vision of therude and sordid margins, the untended approaches surrounding, atresorts, the crowded caravansery of the earlier timeand marking evennow, I inferred, those of the type that still survive; and I caughtverily at play that best virtue of the potent presence. The hotel wasleading again, not followingimposing the standard, not submitting toit; teaching the affluent class how to garden, how, in fact, to tidyup its yardsince affluence alone was supposable there; not receivingat other hands the lesson. It was doing more than thisdiscriminating infavour of the beautiful, and above all in favour of the refined, withan energy that again, in the most interesting way, seemed to cause thegeneral question of the future of beauty in America to heave in itsunrest.Fifty times, already, I had felt myself catching this vibration,received some vivid impression of the growing quantity of forceavailable for that conquestof all the latent powers of freedom ofspace, of wealth, of faith and knowledge and curiosity, verily perhapseven of sustained passion, potentially at its service. Thesepossibilities glimmer before one at times, in presence of some artisticeffect expensively yet intelligently, yet even charmingly produced, withthe result of your earnestly saying: Why not more and more then, whynot an immense exploration, an immense exhibition, of suchpossibilities? What is wanting for it, after all, in the way of? Justthere it is indeed that you pull yourself upah, in the way of what? Youare conscious that what you recognize in especial is not so much thepositive as the negative strength of the case. What you see is the spaceand the freedomwhich at every turn, in America, make one yearn to takeother things for granted. The ground is so clear of preoccupation, theair so clear of prejudgment and doubt, that you wonder why the chanceshouldnt be as great for the sthetic revel as for the political andeconomic, why some great undaunted adventure of the arts, meeting in itspath none of the aged lions of prescription, of proscription, of merelyjealous tradition, should not take place in conditions unexampled. Fromthe moment it is but a question of some ones, of every ones caring,where was the conceivable quantity of care, where were the means andchances of application, ever so great? And the precedent, the analogy,of the universal organizing passion, the native aptitude for puttingaffairs through, indubitably haunts you: you are so aware of theacuteness and the courage that you fall but a little short of figuringthem as sthetically contributive. But you do fall short; you rememberin time that great creations of taste and faith never express themselves_primarily_ in terms of mere convenience and zeal, and that all thewaiting money and all the general fury have, at the most, the sole valueof being destined to be good for beauty _when it shall appear_. Theyhave it in them so little, by themselves, to make it appear, that yourunfinished question arrives easily enough, in that light, at its end.What is wanting in the way of taste? is the right form of theinquirythat small circumstance alone being _positively_ contributive.The others, the boundless field, the endless gold, the habit of greatenterprises, are, you feel, at most, simple negations of difficulty.They affect you none the less, however, as a rank of stalwart soldiersand servants who, as they stand at attention, plead from wistful eyes tobe enrolled and used; so that before any embodied symptom of theprecious principle they are there in the background of your thought.These lingering instants spent in the presence of such symptoms, thesebrief moments of sthetic arrestliable to occur in the most diverseconnectionshave an interest that quite picks them, I think, from theheap of ones American hours. And the interest is always fine, throwingone back as, by a further turn, it usually does, on the question of thetrick possibly played, for your appreciation, by mere negation ofdifficulty. To what extent may the absence of difficulty, to what extentmay not facility of purchase and sweet simplicity of pride, surprise youinto taking them momentarily for a demonstration of taste? You remain onyour guard, very properly; but the interest, as I have called it,doesnt flag, none the less, since there is one mistake into which younever need fall, and one charming, one touching appearance that you maytake as representing, wherever you meet it, a reality. When once youhave interpreted the admonitory sign I have just named as the inordinate_desire for taste_, a desire breaking into a greater number of quaintand candid forms, probably, than have ever been known upon earth, theair is in a manner clearer, and you know sufficiently where you are.Isnt it cleared, moreover, beyond doubt, to the positive increase ofthe interest, and doesnt the question then become, almost thrillingly,that of the degree to which this pathos of desire may be condemned toremain a mere heartbreak to the historic muse? _Is_ that to be,possibly, the American futureso far as, over such a mystery ofmysteries, glibness may be permitted? The fascination grows while youwonderas, from the moment you have begun to go into the matter at all,wonder you certainly must. If with difficulties so conjured away bypower, the clear vision, the creative freshness, the real thing in aword, _shall_ have to continue to be represented, indefinitely, but by agilded yearning, the inference is then irresistible that these blessingsare indeed of their essence a sovereign rarity. If with so many of theconditions they yet hang back, on what particular occult furtherancemust they not incorruptibly depend? What are the other elements thatmake for them, and in what manner and at what points does the wrongcombination of such elements, on the American scene, work forfrustration? Entrancing speculation!which has brought me back by a longcircuit to the shining marble villa on the edge of Lake Worth.I was about to allude to this wondrous creation as the supreme instanceof missionary effort on the part of the hotel-spiritby which I mean ofthe effort to illustrate and embody a group of its ideals, to give asplendid concrete example of its ability to flower, at will, intoconcentration, into conspicuous privacy, into a care for all therefinements. The palace rears itself, behind its own high gates andgilded, transparent barriers, at a few minutes walk from the greatcaravanseries; it sits there, in its admirable garden, amid its statuesand fountains, the hugeness of its more or less antique vases andsarcophagicostliest reproductions allas if to put to shame thoseremembered villas of the Lake of Como, of the Borromean Islands, thetype, the climate, the horticultural elegance, the containedcuriosities, luxuries, treasures, of which it invokes only to surpassthem at every point. New with that consistency of newness which one seesonly in the States, it seems to say, somehow, that to some such heaven,some such public exaltation of the Blest, those who have conformed withdue earnestness to the hotel-spirit, and for a sufficiently longprobation, may hope eventually to penetrate or perhaps actually retire.It has sprung from the genius of the divine Pair, the Dioscurithemselvesas Castor and Pollux were the sons of Zeus; and has this,above all, of exemplary, that whereas one had in other climes andcountries often seen the proprietor of estates construct an hotel, orhotels, on a piece of his property, and even, when rigid need was, inproximity to his home, one had not elsewhere seen the home adjoined tothe hotel, and placed, with such magnificence, under its protection and,as one might say, its star. In the former caseit was easy toreflectthere had been ever, at best, an effect of incoherence; whilethe beauty of logic, of the strictly consequent, was all on the side ofthe latter. So much as that one may say; but I should find it hard toexpress without some air of extravagance my sense of the beauty of thelesson read to the general Palm Beach consciousness from behind thegilded gates and between the large interstices of the enclosure. It hadthe immense merit that it was suited, admirably, to the boarders; itpreached them the gospel of civilization all in their own terms andwithout the waste of an accent; it was in short the apotheosis, theideal form of the final home that may pretend to crown a career ofsufficiently expensive boarding. Anything less gorgeous wouldnt havebeen proportioned to so much expense, nor anything more sequestered inthe key of such a mode of life. But I detach myself, with reluctance,from the view of this interesting creationinteresting in its sense ofbathing the whole question of manners in a light. Anything that doesthat is a boon to the restless analyst; and I remember rejoicing that heshould have been introduced promptly to the marble palace, which struckhim as rewarding attention the more attention was privileged and thefurther it might penetrate. Such an experience was, all properly,preliminary to a view of the rest of the scene; since otherwise,frankly, in relation to what at all represented ideal were the boarders,in their vast multitude, to be viewed?For the boarders, verily, were the great indicated show, as I hadgathered in advance, at Palm Beach; it had been promised one, on allsides, that there, as nowhere else, in America, one would find VanityFair in full blastand Vanity Fair not scattered, not discriminated andparcelled out, as among the comparative privacies and ancientries ofNewport, but compressed under one vast cover, enclosed in a single huge_vitrine_, which there would be nothing to prevent ones flatteningones nose against for days of delight. It was into Vanity Fair,accordingly, that one embraced every opportunity to press; it was theboarders, frankly, who engaged ones attention in default of any greatarray of other elements. The other elements, it must be confessed,strike the visitor as few; he has soon come to the end of them, eventhough they consist of the greater part of the rest of the sense ofFlorida. And he seems to himself to pursue them, mainly, at the tail,and in the constant track of the boarders; these latter are so numerous,and the clearing in the jungle so comparatively minute, that there isscant occasion for the wandering apart which always forms, under the lawof the herd, the intenser joy. The velvet air, the colour of the sea,the royal palms, clustered here and there, and, in their nobleness ofbeauty, their single sublime distinction, putting every other mark andsign to the blush, these are the principal figures of the sumthese,with the custom of the short dip into the jungle, at two or three pointsof which, approached by charming, winding wood-ways, the small butgenial fruit-farm offers hospitalityoffers it in all the succulence ofthe admirable pale-skinned orange and the huge sun-warmed grapefruit,plucked from the low bough, where it fairly bumps your cheek forsolicitation, and partaken of, on the spot, as the immortal ladies ofCranford partook of dessertwith a few steps aside, the back turned anda betrayed ingurgitation. It is by means of a light perambulator, ofadult size, but constructed of wicker-work, and pendent from a bicyclepropelled by a robust negro, that the jungle is thus visited; thebicycle follows the serpentine track, the secluded ranch is swiftlyreached, the peaceful retirement of the cultivators multitudinouslyadmired, the perambulator promptly re-entered, the darkey restored tothe saddle and his charge again to the hotel.                                   VIt is all most agreeable and diverting, it is almost, the boardersapart, romantic; but it is soon over, and there is not much more of it.The uncanny conception, the rank eccentricity of a walk encountersneither favour nor facilitybut on the subject of the inveteracy withwhich the conditions, over the land, conspire against that sweetsubterfuge there would be more to say than I may here deal with. One ofthese gentle ranches was approached by water, as Palm Beach has a fronton its vast, fresh lake as well as seaward; a steam-launch puts you downat the garden foot, and the place is less infested by the boarders, lessconfessedly undefended, less artlessly ignorant in fine (thanks perhapsto the mere interposing water) of any possible right to occultation; thegeneral absence of conception of that right, nowhere asserted, nowhereembodied, everywhere in fact quite sacrificially abrogated, qualifyingat last your very sense of the American characterqualifying it verymuch as a pervading unsaltedness qualifies the taste of a dinner. Thisbrief excursion remains with me, at any rate, as a delicate andexquisite impression; the neck of land that stretched from the languidlake to the anxious sea, the approach to real detachment, the graciousNorthern hostess, just veiled, for the right felicity, in a thinnostalgic sadness, the precious recall in particular of having succeededin straying a little, through groves of the pensive palm, down to thesandy, the vaguely-troubled shore. There was a certain concentration inthe hour, a certain intensity in the note, a certain intimacy in thewhole communion; I found myself loving, quite fraternally, the palms,which had struck me at first, for all their human-headed gravity, asmerely dry and taciturn, but which became finally as sympathetic as somany rows of puzzled philosophers, dishevelled, shock-pated, with theriddle of the universe. This scantness and sweetness and sadness, thisstrange peninsular spell, _this_, I said, was sub-tropical Floridaanddoubtless as permitted a glimpse as I should ever have of any sucheffect. The softness was divinelike something mixed, in a huge silvercrucible, as an elixir, and then liquidly scattered. But the refinementof the experience would be the summer noon or the summer nightit wouldbe then the breast of Nature would open; save only that, so lost in itand with such lubrication of surrender, how should one ever come back?As it was, one came back soon enough, back to ones proper business:which appeared to be, urgently, strictly, severely, the pursuit of theboarders up and down the long corridors and round about the wideverandahs of their crowded career. I had been admirably provided for atthe less egregious of the two hotels; which was vast and cool and fair,friendly, breezy, shiny, swabbed and burnished like a royal yacht,really immaculate and delightful; full of interesting lights and yetstanding but on the edge of the whirlpool, the centre of which formedthe heart of the adjacent colossus. One could plunge, by a short walkthrough a luxuriance of garden, into the deeper depths; one could loseones self, if so minded, in the labyrinth of the other show. There, ifVanity Fair was not encamped, it was not for want of booths; the longcorridors were streets of shops, dealing, naturally, in commoditiesalmost beyond pricenot the cheap gimcracks of the usual watering-placebarrack, but solid (when not elaborately ethereal), formidable,incalculable values, of which it was of an admonitory economic interestto observe the triumphant appeal. They hadnt terrors, apparently, forthe clustered boarders, these idols and monsters of the marketneitherthe wild fantastications of the milliner, the uncovered fires, disclosedsecrets of the gem-merchant, the errant tapestries and _bahuts_ of theantiquarian, nor, what I found most impressive and what has everywhereits picture-making force, those ordered dispositions and stretchedlengths of old point in the midst of which a quiet lady in black,occupied with some small stitch of her own, is apt to raise at you, withexpensive deliberation, a grave, white Flemish face. The interest of thegeneral spectacle was supposed to be, I had gathered, that people fromall parts of the country contributed to it; and the value of thetestimony as to manners was that it brought to a focus so many elementsof difference. The elements of difference, whatever they might latentlyhave been, struck me as throughout forcibly simplified by the conditionsof the place; this prompt reducibility of a thousand figures to a commondenominator having been in fact, to my sense, the very moral of thepicture. Individuality and variety is attributed to types, in America,on easy terms, and the reputation for it enjoyed on terms not moredifficult; so that what I was most conscious of, from aspect to aspect,from group to group, from sex to sex, from one presented boarder toanother, was the continuity of the fusion, the dimness of thedistinctions.The distinction that was least absent, however, would have been, Ijudge, that of the comparative ability to spend and purchase; theability to spend with freedom being, as one made out, a positiveconsistent with all sorts of negatives. That helped to make the wholething documentarythat you had to be financially more or less at yourease to enjoy the privileges of the Royal Poinciana at all; enjoy themthrough their extended range of saloons and galleries, fields of highpublicity all; pursue them from dining-halls to music-rooms, toball-rooms, to card-rooms, to writing-rooms, to a succession of placesof convenience and refreshment, not the least characteristic of which,no doubt, was the terrace appointed to mid-morning and mid-afternoondrinksdrinks, at the latter hour, that appeared, oddly, never tocomprise tea, the only one appreciated in Europe at that time of day.(The quest of tea indeed, especially at the hour when it is most ablessing, struck me as attended, throughout the country, withdifficulties, even with dangers; over ground where ones steps arebeset, everywhere, with an infinite number of strange, sweet icedliquiditiesmany of these, I hasten to add, charmingly congruous, intheir non-alcoholic ingenuity, with the heats of summer: a circumstancethat doesnt prevent their flourishing equally in the rigour of cold.)The implication of ease was thus a light to assist inquiry; it isalways a gained fact about peopleas to where they are, if not as towho or whatthat they are either in confirmed or in casual possession ofmoney, and thereby, presumably, of all that money may, in thisnegotiable world, represent. Add to this that the company came, in itsprovided state, by common report, from all over, that it convergedupon Palm Beach from every prosperous corner of the land, and the casewas clear for a compendious view of American society in the largestsense of the term. Society, as we loosely use the word, is made up ofthe fortunate few, and, if that number be everywhere small at the best,it was yet the fortunate who, after their fashion, filled the frame.Every obligation lay upon me to study them as so gathered in, and Idid my utmost, I remember, to render them that respect; yet when I now,after an interval, consult my notes, I find the page a blank, and when Iknock at the door of memory I find it perversely closed. If it consentsa little to open, rather, a countenance looks outthat of theinscrutable warden of the precinctand seems to show me the ambiguoussmile that accompanies on occasion the plea to be excused.From which I infer that the form and pressure of the boarders, for all Ihad expected of the promised picture, failed somehow to affect me as adiscussable quantity. It is of the nature of many American impressions,accepted at the time as a whole of the particular story, simply to ceaseto be, as soon as your back is turnedto fade, to pass away, to leavenot a wreck behind. This happens not least when the image, whatever itmay have been, has exacted the tribute of wonder or pleasure: it hasdisplayed every virtue but the virtue of being able to remain with you.Its pressure and power have failed of some weight, some element ofdensity or intensity, some property or quality in short that makes forthe authority of a figure, for the complexity of a scene. The Europeanvision, in general, of whatever consisting, and even when making less ofan explicit appeal, has behind it a driving forcederived from sourcesinto which I wont pretend here to enterthat make it, comparatively,bite, as the plate of the etcher is bitten by aquafortis. Thatdoubtless is the matter, in the States, with the vast peaceful andprosperous human showin conditions, especially, in which its peace andprosperity most shine out: it registers itself on the plate with anincision too vague and, above all, too uniform. The paucity of onesnotes is in itself, no doubt, a report of the consulted oracle; itdescribes and reconstitutes for me the array of the boarders, thiscircumstance that I only grope for their features and seek in vain todiscriminate between sorts and conditions. There were the two sexes, Ithink, and the range of age, but, once the one comprehensive type wasembraced, no other signs of differentiation. How should there have beenwhen the men were consistently, in all cases, thoroughly obviousproducts of the business-block, the business-block unmitigated by anyother influence definite enough to name, and the women were, under thesame strictness, the indulged ladies of such lords? The business-blockhas perhaps, from the north-east to the south-west, its finediversities, but any variety so introduced eluded even the most broodingof analysts.And it was not of course that the marks of uniformity, among so manypersons, were not on _their_ side perfectly appreciable; it was onlythat when one had noted them as marks of success, no doubt, primarily,and then as those of great gregarious decency and sociability andgood-humour, one had exhausted the list. It was the scant diversity oftype that left me short, as a story-seeker or picture-maker;contributive as this very fact might be to admiration of the costlyprocesses, as they thus appear, that ensure, and that alone ensure, inother societies, the opposite of that scantness. With this, as theforedoomed observer may never escape from the dreadful faculty thatrides him, the very simplifications had in the highest degree theirillustrative value; they gave all opportunity to anything or any onethat might be salient. They gave it to the positive bourgeois propriety,serenely, imperturbably, massively seated, and against which anyexperimental deviation from the bourgeois would have dashed itself invain. This neutrality of respectability might have been figured by agreat grey wash of some charged moist brush causing colour and outline,on the pictured paper, effectually to run together. What resisted itbest was the look of business success in some of the men; when thatsuccess had been very great (and there were indicated cases of itsprodigious greatness) the look was in its turn very great; when it hadbeen small, on the other hand, there was doubtless no look at allsincethere were no other conceivable sources of appearance. The people hadnot, and the women least of all, one felt, in general, been transferredfrom other backgrounds; the scene around them and behind themconstituted as replete a medium as they could ever have been consciousof; the women in particular failed in an extraordinary degree to engagethe imagination, to offer it, so to speak, references or openings: itfaltereddoubtless respectfully enoughwhere they for the most part sosubstantially and prosaically sat, failing of any warrant to go an inchfurther. As for the younger persons, of whom there were many, as for theyoung girls in especial, they were as perfectly in their element asgoldfish in a crystal jar: a form of exhibition suggesting but onequestion or mystery. Was it they who had invented it, or had itinscrutably invented _them_?                                   VIThe case of St. Augustine afterwards struck me as presenting, on anotherside, its analogy with the case at Palm Beach: if the social interesthad in the latter place appeared but of a weak constitution, so thehistoric, at the former, was to work a spell of a simpler sort than onehad been brought up, as it were, to look to. Hadnt one been brought up,from far back, on the article of that faith in St. Augustine, byperiodical papers in the magazines, fond elucidations of its romanticcharacter, accompanied by drawings that gave one quite proudly, quitepatriotically, to thinkthat filled the cup of curiosity and yearning?The old townfor the essence of the faith had been that there _was_ anold townreceded into an all but untraceable past; it had been of allAmerican towns the earliest planted, and it bristled still with everyevidence of its Spanish antiquity. The illustrations in the magazines,wondrous vignettes of old street vistas, old architectural treasures,gateways and ramparts, odds and ends, nooks and corners, crowned withthe sweetness of slow decay, conveyed the sense of these delights andrenewed at frequent intervals their appeal. But oh, as I was to observe,the school of black and white trained up by the magazines has much, inthe American air, to answer for: it points so vividly the homely moralthat when you havent what you like you must perforce like, and aboveall misrepresent, what you have. Its translation of these perfunctorypassions into pictorial terms saddles it with a weight of responsibilitythat would be greater, one can only say, if there ever were a critic,some guardian of real values, to bring it to book. The guardians of realvalues struck me as, up and down, far to seek. The whole matter indeedwould seem to come back, interestingly enough, to the general truth ofthe sthetic need, in the country, for much greater values, of certainsorts, than the country and its manners, its aspects and arrangements,its past and present, and perhaps even future, really supply; whereby,as the sthetic need is also intermixed with a patriotic yearning, asupply has somehow to be extemporized, by any pardonable form ofpictorial hankey-pankeyhas to be, as the expression goes, cleverlyfaked. But it takes an inordinate amount of faking to meet thesupposed intensity of appetite of a body of readers at once morenumerous and less critical than any other in the world; so that,frankly, the desperate expedient is written large in much of theartistic activity of the country.The results are of the oddest; they hang all traceably together;wonderful in short the general spectacle and lesson of the scale andvariety of the faking. They renew again the frequent admonition that thepabulum provided for a great thriving democracy may derive most of itsinterest from the nature of its testimony to the thriving democraticdemand. No long time is required, in the States, to make vivid for thevisitor the truth that the nation is almost feverishly engaged inproducing, with the greatest possible activity and expedition, anintellectual pabulum after its own heart, and that not only the artsand ingenuities of the draftsman (called upon to furnish the picturesquebackground and people it with the aristocratic figure where neither ofthese revelations ever meets his eye) pay their extravagant tribute, butthat those of the journalist, the novelist, the dramatist, thegenealogist, the historian, are pressed as well, for dear life, into theservice. The illustrators of the magazines improvise, largelythat iswhen not labouring in the cause of the rural dialectsimprovise thefield of action, full of features at any price, and the characters whofigure upon it, young gods and goddesses mostly, of superhuman statureand towering pride; the novelists improvise, with the aid of thehistorians, a romantic local past of costume and compliment andsword-play and gallantry and passion; the dramatists build up, of athousand pieces, the airy fiction that the life of the people in theworld among whom the elements of clash and contrast are simplest andmost superficial abounds in the subjects and situations and effects ofthe theatre; while the genealogists touch up the picture with theirpleasant hint of the number, over the land, of families of royal blood.All this constitutes a vast home-grown provision for entertainment,rapidly superseding any that may be borrowed or imported, and thatindeed already begins, not invisibly, to press for exportation. As toquantity, it looms immense, and resounds in proportion, yet with theproperty, all its own, of ceasing to be, of fading like the mist ofdawnthat is of giving no account of itself whateveras soon as oneturns on it any intending eye of appreciation or of inquiry. It is thepublic these appearances collectively refer us to that becomes thusagain the more attaching subject; the public so placidly uncritical thatthe whitest thread of the deceptive stitch never makes it blink, andsentimental at once with such inveteracy and such simplicity that,finding everything everywhere perfectly splendid, it fairly goes uponits knees to be humbuggingly humbugged. It proves ever, by the ironicmeasure, quite incalculably young.That perhaps was all that had been the matter with it in presence of theimmemorial legend of St. Augustine as a mine of romance; St. Augustineproving primarily, and of course quite legitimately, but an hotel, ofthe first magnitudean hotel indeed so remarkable and so pleasant that Iwondered what call there need ever have been upon it to prove anythingelse. The Ponce de Leon, for that matter, comes as near producing, allby itself, the illusion of romance as a highly modern, a mostcleverly-constructed and smoothly-administered great modern caravanserycan come; it is largely in the Moorish style (as the cities of Spainpreserve the record of that manner); it breaks out, on every pretext,into circular arches and embroidered screens, into courts and cloisters,arcades and fountains, fantastic projections and lordly towers, and is,in all sorts of ways and in the highest sense of the word, the mostamusing of hotels. It did for me, at St. Augustine, I was well aware,everything that an hotel could doafter which I could but appeal forfurther service to the old Spanish Fort, the empty, sunny, grassy shellby the low, pale shore; the mild, time-silvered quadrilateral that,under the care of a single exhibitory veteran and with the still milderremnant of a town-gate near it, preserves alone, to any effect ofappreciable emphasis, the memory of the Spanish occupation. One wanderedthere for meditationit is not congruous with the genius of Florida, Igathered, to permit you to wander very far; and it was there perhapsthat, as nothing prompted, on the whole, to intenser musings, I sufferedmyself to be set moralizing, in the manner of which I have just given anexample, over the too thin projection of legend, the too dry responseof association. The Spanish occupation, shortest of ineffectualchapters, seemed the ghost of a ghost, and the burnt-out fire but such apinch of ashes as one might properly fold between the leaves of ones_Baedeker_. Yet if I made this remark I made it without bitterness;since there was no doubt, under the influence of this last look, thatFlorida still had, in her ingenuous, not at all insidious way, thesecret of pleasing, and that even round about me the vagueness was stillan appeal. The vagueness was warm, the vagueness was bright, thevagueness was sweet, being scented and flowered and fruited; above all,the vagueness was somehow consciously and confessedly weak. I made outin it something of the look of the charming shy face that desires tocommunicate and that yet has just too little expression. What it wouldfain say was that it really knew itself unequal to any extravagance ofdemand upon it, but that (if it might so plead to ones tenderness) itwould always do its gentle best. I found the plea, for myself, I maydeclare, exquisite and irresistible: the Florida of that particular tonewas a Florida adorable.                                  VIIThis last impression had indeed everything to gain from the sad rigourof steps retraced, an inevitable return to the North (in the interest ofa directly subsequent, and thereby gracelessly roundabout, moveWestward); and I confess to having felt on that occasion, before thedire backwardness of the Northern spring, as if I had, while travellingin the other sense, but blasphemed against the want of forwardness ofthe Southern. Every breath that one might still have drawn in theSouthmight if twenty other matters had been differenthaunted me as thethought of a lost treasure, and I settled, at the eternal car-window, tothe mere sightless contemplation, the forlorn view, of an uglyah, suchan ugly, wintering, waiting world. My eye had perhaps been jaundiced bythe breach of a happy spellinasmuch as on thus leaving the sadfragments there where they had fallen I tasted again the quitesaccharine sweetness of my last experience of Palm Beach, and knew how Ishould wish to note for remembrance the passage, supremely charged withthat quality, in which it had culminated. I asked myself what otherexpression I should find for the incident, the afternoon before I leftthe place, of one of those mild progresses to the head of Lake Worthwhich distil, for the good children of the Pair, the purest poetry oftheir cup. The poetic effect had braved the compromising aid of thehighly-developed electric launch in which the pilgrim embarks, andbraved as well the immitigable fact that his shrine, at the end of acouple of hours, is, in the vast and exquisite void, but an institutionof yesterday, a wondrous floating tea-house or restaurant, inflatedagain with the hotel-spirit and exhaling modernity at every pore.These associations areso far as association goesthe only ones; but thewhole impression, for simply sitting there in the softest lap the wholeSouth had to offer, seemed to me to dispense with any aid but that ofits own absolute felicity. It was, for the late return at least, thereturn in the divine dusk, with the flushed West at ones right, aconcert of but two or three notesthe alignment, against the golden sky,of the individual black palms, a frieze of chiselled ebony, and thetexture, for faintly-brushed cheek and brow, of an air of such silkinessof velvet, the very throne-robe of the star-crowned night, as one canscarce commemorate but in the language of the loom. The shore of thesunset and the palms, what was that, meanwhile, like, and yet with whatdid it, at the moment one asked the question, refuse to have anything todo? It was like a myriad pictures of the Nile; with much of the modernlife of which it suggested more than one analogy. These indeed alldropped, I found, before I had doneit would have been a Nile sosimplified out of the various fine senses attachable. One had to put thecase, I mean, to _make_ a fine sense, that here surely then was thegreater antiquity of the two, the antiquity of the infinite _previous_,of the time, before Pharaohs and Pyramids, when everything was still tocome. It was a Nile, in short, without the least little implication of aSphinx or, still more if possible, of a Cleopatra. I had the foretasteof what I was presently to feel in Californiawhen the general aspect ofthat wondrous realm kept suggesting to me a sort of prepared butunconscious and inexperienced Italy, the primitive _plate_, in perfectcondition, but with the impression of History all yet to be made.Of how grimly, meanwhile, under the annual rigour, the world, for themost part, waits to be less ugly again, less despoiled of interest, lessabandoned to monotony, less forsaken of the presence that forms its onlyresource, of the one friend to whom it owes all it ever gets, of thepitying season that shall save it from its huge insignificanceof somuch as this, no doubt, I sufficiently renewed my vision, and withplenty of the reviving ache of a question already familiar. To whatextent was hugeness, to what extent _could_ it be, a ground forcomplacency of view, in any country not visited for the very love ofwildness, for positive joy in barbarism? Where was the charm ofboundless immensity as overlooked from a car-window?with the generalpretension to charm, the general conquest of nature and space, affirmed,immediately round about you, by the general pretension of the Pullman,the great monotonous rumble of which seems forever to say to you: Seewhat Im making of all thissee what Im making, what Im making! I wasto become later on still more intimately aware of the spirit of onespossible reply to that, but even then my consciousness served, and theeloquence of my exasperation seems, in its rude accents, to come back tome.I see what you are _not_ making, oh, what you are ever so vividly not;and how can I help it if I am subject to that lucidity?which appearsnever so welcome to you, for its measure of truth, as it ought to be!How can I not be so subject, from the moment I dont just irreflectivelygape? If I were one of the painted savages you have dispossessed, oreven some tough reactionary trying to emulate him, what you are makingwould doubtless impress me more than what you are leaving unmade; for inthat case it wouldnt be to _you_ I should be looking in any degree forbeauty or for charm. Beauty and charm would be for me in the solitudeyou have ravaged, and I should owe you my grudge for every disfigurementand every violence, for every wound with which you have caused the faceof the land to bleed. No, since I accept your ravage, what strikes me isthe long list of the arrears of your undone; and so constantly, rightand left, that your pretended message of civilization is but a colossalrecipe for the _creation_ of arrears, and of such as can but remainforever out of hand. You touch the great lonely landas one feels itstill to beonly to plant upon it some ugliness about which, neverdreaming of the grace of apology or contrition, you then proceed to bragwith a cynicism all your own. You convert the large and noble sanitiesthat I see around me, you convert them one after the other to crudities,to invalidities, hideous and unashamed; and you so leave them to add tothe number of the myriad aspects you simply spoil, of the myriadunanswerable questions that you scatter about as some monstrousunnatural mother might leave a family of unfathered infants on doorstepsor in waiting-rooms. This is the meaning surely of the inveterate rulethat you shall multiply the perpetrations you call placesby the signof some name as senseless, mostly, as themselvesto the sole end ofmultiplying to the eye, as one approaches, every possible source ofdispleasure. When nobody cares or notices or suffers, by all one makesout, when no displeasure, by what one can see, is ever felt or everregistered, why shouldnt you, you may indeed ask, be as much in yourright as you need? But in that fact itself, that fact of the vastgeneral unconsciousness and indifference, looms, for any restlessanalyst who may come along, the accumulation, on your hands, of theunretrieved and the irretrievable!I remember how it was to come to me elsewhere, in such hours as those,that south of Pennsylvania, for instance, or beyond the radius ofWashington, I had caught no glimpse of anything that was to be called,for more than a few miles and by a stretch of courtesy, the honour, thedecency or dignity of a roadthat most exemplary of all civil creations,and greater even as a note of morality, one often thinks, than as a noteof facility; and yet had nowhere heard these particular arrears spokenof as matters ever conceivably to be made up. I was doubtless aware thatif I had been a beautiful red man with a tomahawk I should of coursehave rejoiced in the occasional sandy track, or in the occasionalmud-channel, just in proportion as they fell so short of the type. Onlyin that case I shouldnt have been seated by the great square ofplate-glass through which the missionary Pullman appeared to invite meto admire the achievements it proclaimed. It was in this respect thegreat symbolic agent; it seemed to stand for all the irresponsibilitybehind it; and I am not sure that I didnt continue, so long as I was init, to slang it for relief of the oerfraught heart. You deal yourwoundsthat is the trouble, as you sayin numbers so out of proportionto any hint of responsibility for them that you seem ever moved to take;which is the devils dance, precisely, that your vast expanse of levelfloor leads you to caper through with more kinds of outwardclumsinesseven if also with more kinds of inward impatience andavidity, more leaps and bounds of the spirit at any cost to gracethanhave ever before been collectively displayed. The expanse of the floor,the material opportunity itself, has elsewhere failed; so that what isthe positive effect of their inordinate presence but to make the loneobserver, here and there, but measure with dismay the trap laid by thescale, if he be not tempted even to say by the superstition, ofcontinuity? Is the germ of anything finely human, of anything agreeablyor successfully social, supposably planted in conditions of such endlessstretching and such boundless spreading as shall appear finally tominister but to the triumph of the superficial and the apotheosis of theraw? Oh for a split or a chasm, one groans beside your plate-glass, ohfor an unbridgeable abyss or an insuperable mountain!and I could soindulge myself though still ignorant of how one was to groan later on,in particular, after taking yet further home the portentous truth thatthis same criminal continuity, scorning its grandest chance to breakdown, makes but a mouthful of the mighty Mississippi. That was to be infact my very next big impression.------------------------------------------------------------------------                     RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED,                      BREAD STREET HILL, E.C., AND                            BUNGAY, SUFFOLK.

It falls into two parts. The first deals withcustom, _i.e._ the rules of conduct which are generally recognised inany society. The most important of these are discussed under differentheads, _e.g._ laws of marriage and the position of women; classrelations, caste, slavery and free labour; the laws of war; commercialand private property; methods of providing for the poor. In each casethe attempt is made to sketch in outline the changes encountered as wepass from the lowest savagery to contemporary civilisation. The secondvolume deals with the ideas lying at the root of custom, _i.e._principally in religion on its ethical side. Primitive religions arebriefly examined, and the principal ethical features of the great worldreligions are passed in review. The ethical doctrines of Confucius andof ancient and modern moral philosophy are next dealt with, and the workconcludes with certain inferences as to the general trend of ethicaldevelopment. _A New Study of Rousseau._ =Jean Jacques Rousseau A New Criticism.=                       =By FREDERIKA MACDONALD=,                     Author of Iliad of the East,           Studies in the France of Voltaire and Rousseau.

The author has discovered that the originaldocuments upon which the existing view of Rousseaus life and characteris based were entirely falsified by his enemies, and photographs aregiven to show where the corrections have been made. The result is thatthe whole story of Rousseaus life will have to be reconsidered, andthat all existing biographies must be rectified.The author contributes an introduction in which she states the purposeand the method of her new criticism. The body of the book is dividedinto five parts: Part I. showing the actual conditions of the questionbefore the new criticism commenced; Part II. giving details of thehistorical inquiry, documentary proofs that Madame DEpinays Memoirsrepresent an instrument of the plot to create a false reputation forRousseau, and to hand it down to posterity; Part III. is devoted to theplan and purpose of the false history of Rousseau interpolated in MadameDEpinays work, the mythical Jean Jacques of Grimm and Diderot, andDiderots Tablettes and the legend of Rousseaus seven crimes; Part IV.deals with the legend of Rousseaus seven crimes; whilst Part V. treatsof the _correspondance littraire_: the second instrument of the plot.A number of photographs and facsimiles of manuscripts are supplied withthe text. _New Carlyle Letters._ =Carlyle and the London Library=   =A Collection of Original Letters to   W.

Experiencing the greatdisadvantage of not having books of reference at hand to work from, andthe utter impossibility of working on such gigantic schemes as his wereat the British Museum, he set on foot an agitation. The end wasrecognised as good, and the great men of the day took up the cause andcarried it through. This little volume comprises the collection ofletters written by Carlyle to W. D. Christie, which brought about theestablishment of the valuable institution known as the London Library,in St. Jamess Square, now looked upon as indispensable. _The Economics of the Future._ =The Return to the Land=                       =By SENATOR JULES MELINE=,    Leader of the Moderate Republicans in France: Former Minister of  Agriculture; Minister of Commerce; Premier. With a Preface by JUSTIN                               MCCARTHY.                                                             =Crown 8vo.                                                             5s. net.=Mr. Justin McCarthy, in his Preface, says:This book seems to medestined to make a deep mark upon the age. Senator Jules Mline, leaderof the Moderate Republicans in France, was Minister of Agriculture inthe Cabinet of Jules Ferry from 1883 to 1885; was elected President ofthe representative chamber of France in 1889; and in 1896 became PrimeMinister, an office which he resigned not long after, having foundprobably that his political views were not radical enough for the publicopinion of the country. The book is remarkable in every sense. With allits practical teaching, with its minute and careful instruction onmanufacturing and industrial questions, there is not a dull page in itfrom first to last. M. Mline has much of the feeling of the poet aswell as the reasoning power of the practical and the scientific teacher.Even where the reader may not accept all the principles of politicaleconomy on which M. Mline founds many parts of his case, that reader,if he have an appreciative mind, cannot fail to admire the sincerity,the power, and the persuasiveness of the author.The great object of the book is to convince the world that the returnto the land, and to the work which the land still offers in all or mostcountries, is now the nearest and the surest means for the mitigation orthe removal of the troubles which have come on the working populationseverywhere, and that the present is the appropriate time for thebeginning of such a movement.The reader who begins this volume with nothing more than a creditabledesire to learn something about the development of manufacturingindustry here, there, and everywhere, soon finds himself absorbed in M.Mlines exposition as much as if he were reading a story of magic fromthe _Thousand and One Nights_. _Reminiscences of an Actor._ =Joseph Jefferson Reminiscences of a Fellow-Player.=                          =By FRANCIS WILSON=,                  Author of The Eugene Field I Knew,                 Recollections of a Player, &c., &c.               With 33 Portraits and other Illustrations.                                                          =Demy 8vo.                                                          10s. 6d. net.=It is seldom that a biographic volume brings together more fitly thesubject and the chronicler than does this juxtaposition of JosephJefferson and Francis Wilson. Men in the same profession, they werestill further sympathetic by reason of their love of good books and goodpictures, and through their kindly and humorous view of human nature,and in their enjoyment of the oddities of every-day life and character.For many years Mr. Wilson was a hero-worshipper of Joseph Jefferson; asa small boy he rubbed against him in the street, in order, boy-fashion,to feel that he had touched the hem of his garment. When he grew to knowthe man, he set down from time to time a full record of Jeffersonscharming conversation. During the weeks of the all-star tour he made afurther record of the table-talk of Mr. Jefferson when surrounded withthat splendid body of actors which included Mrs. Drew, William H. Crane,the Hollands, Julia Marlowe, Nat Goodwin, Fanny Rice, Robert Taber, andMr. Wilson himself. It was a company to draw out the best of Jeffersonsvaried experiences, and the best was set down by Mr. Wilson, and hasbeen reproduced in this delightful volume of reminiscences. Mr. Wilsonhas written one of those books about the American stage that is sure tohave a permanent place; and moreover, by the good taste with which hehas written it, and by the excellent literary skill which he has shown,he has produced a volume worthy of very high praise as a literaryperformance. _A Study of Hypnotism._ =Hypnotism and Spiritism   A Critical and Medical Study.=                       =By Dr. GIUSEPPE LAPPONI=,       Chief Physician to Their Holinesses Leo XIII. and Pius X.;           Professor of Anthropology in the Academy at Rome.                    Translated by Mrs. PHILIP GIBBS.                                                             =Crown 8vo.                                                             6s.=This book, which has made a tremendous stir upon the Continent, tracesthe study of Hypnotism and Spiritism from the earliest ages to thepresent day, and defines the future of the science and its probablebearing upon national life. _A New Work by CHARLES G. HARPER._ =The Old Inns of Old England=   =A Picturesque Account of the Ancient   and Storied Hostelries of our own   Country.=                        =By CHARLES G.

This vacantniche in the literature of the road is filled by the present volumes,the latest in the series of works on the Historic Roads of England, andthe literature of travel in general, written by Mr. Charles G. Harper,and intended eventually to comprise every aspect of our ancienthighways, and the life upon them in days of yore. It is believed that,while, of necessity, not every picturesque inn could be mentioned orillustrated in two large volumes, a fully representative set has beenincluded.As in his earlier works, the authors aim has been the entirely modernone of seeking to amuse and interest the general reader, and the book istherefore in no sense an architectural or antiquarian disquisition. _A Study in Sociology._ =The Polish Jew   His Social and Economic Value.=                     =By BEATRICE C.

During this time Ihave had every opportunity of observing the Polish Jew both in the townsand settlements, and have been in contact with the leaders of thought onall sides of the question from the Anti-Semite to the Jewishnationalist. I have witnessed the growth of that revival which has nowspread throughout most of the settlements and all the large ghettos ofthe country, and which has engendered hostility to the Gentile andrevolution against the powers that be. The fact that thousands of themen and women here discussed annually emigrate to compete with theEnglish-speaking nations, has caused me to investigate their social andeconomic value the more carefully, both for the sake of the pauperaliens themselves and for that of the people among whom they eventuallysettle.Extract from Authors Preface.                          THE NATIONAL EDITION                            OF THE WORKS OF                           =Charles Dickens= Including upwards of One Hundred and Thirty Articles now collected for                            the first time.                                  HIS                 =LETTERS, SPEECHES, PLAYS, and POEMS=,                             TOGETHER WITH                    =FORSTERS LIFE OF THE AUTHOR=.The pictures, numbering upwards of 850, comprise all the OriginalIllustrations; with a complete series of Portraits, AdditionalIllustrations, Facsimiles and Reproductions of Handwriting, many ofwhich have not been included in any collected edition of the novelistsworks; the whole printed upon India Paper, and mounted on Plate paper.  Strictly limited to 750 sets for England and America. Complete in 40                                Volumes.                Royal 8vo. Price =10s. 6d.= net per vol.The National Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens is designed to rankas the final and definitive edition of his works, and to serve as aworthy memorial to the connection which has subsisted for over seventyyears between the firm of Chapman and Hall and the immortal memory ofCharles Dickens. It is by far the most handsome edition of Dickens everplaced upon the market, and being strictly limited in number is likelyto take its place in a very short time among those treasures of thebooklover which change hands at highly enhanced prices.The edition is being printed by Messrs. T. and A. Constable ofEdinburgh, His Majestys Printers, in a type newly cast for the purpose,upon pure rag paper of the highest quality.=THE TEXT.=The text used is that which was corrected by Charles Dickenshimself in the last two years of his life, and therefore contains allthe copyright emendations which he made when the volumes passed for thelast time through his hands.The edition contains all the collected papers from whatever source thatseemed worthy of permanent association with the name of theirauthorfrom _The Examiner_, _Daily News_, _Household Words_, _All theYear Round_, over 130 in allthe most notable of these being allDickenss contributions to _Household Words_, some 90 in number, _whichhave been identified for the first time by indisputable evidence_.=THE ILLUSTRATIONS.=As regards the choice of illustrations, thePublishers plan has been to include only those pictures which weredrawn for their editions during the life of the author, and which maytherefore be held to have received his personal approbation. Under thisarrangement they are able to reproduce for the first time in a CollectedEdition a number of illustrations not usually associated with thenovels, and the utmost care has been taken to do justice to the artistsworkmanship. The original illustrations are printed from a duplicate setof the steel plates on the best India paper and mounted on plate paperaprocess which gives a greatly refined value to the delicacy of theoriginal steel plates.=THE ARTISTS.=Dickens, as is well known, took the keenest possibleinterest in the illustrations to his books, and was very particular overthe choice of the artists. At the same time, his work offered suchinfinite possibilities to pen and pencil, that all the best talent ofhis time was eager to be employed in his service, with the result thatthe muster-roll of the artists represented in the present editioncontains the names of all the leading masters of Black and Whitethroughout the Victorian Era. It may be said without exaggeration thatthe illustrations alone form an historical picture gallery of theirtime, as will be admitted when the following list is studied andunderstood.
