THE NIGHT WIREBy H. F. ArnoldNew York, September 30 CP FLASHAmbassador Holliwell died here today. The end came suddenly as theambassador was alone in his study....Theres something ungodly about these night wire jobs. You sit up hereon the top floor of a skyscraper and listen in to the whispers of acivilization. New York, London, Calcutta, Bombay, Singapore--theyreyour next-door neighbors after the street lights go dim and the worldhas gone to sleep.Along in the quiet hours between 2 and 4, the receiving operators dozeover their sounders and the news comes in. Fires and disasters andsuicides. Murders, crowds, catastrophes. Sometimes an earthquake witha casualty list as long as your arm. The night wire man takes it downalmost in his sleep, picking it off on his typewriter with one finger.Once in a long time you prick up your ears and listen. Youve heard ofsomeone you knew in Singapore, Halifax or Paris, long ago. Maybetheyve been promoted, but more probably theyve been murdered ordrowned. Perhaps they just decided to quit and took some bizarre wayout. Made it interesting enough to get in the news.But that doesnt happen often. Most of the time you sit and doze andtap, tap on your typewriter and wish you were home in bed.Sometimes, though, queer things happen. One did the other night and Ihavent got over it yet. I wish I could.You see, I handle the night managers desk in a western seaport town;what the name is, doesnt matter.There is, or rather was, only one night operator on my staff, a fellownamed John Morgan, about forty years of age, I should say, and asober, hard-working sort.He was one of the best operators I ever knew, what is known as adouble man. That means he could handle two instruments at once andtype the stories on different typewriters at the same time. He was oneof the three men I ever knew who could do it consistently, hour afterhour, and never make a mistake.Generally we used only one wire at night, but sometimes, when it waslate and the news was coming fast, the Chicago and Denver stationswould open a second wire and then Morgan would do his stuff. He was awizard, a mechanical automatic wizard which functioned marvelously butwas without imagination.On the night of the sixteenth he complained of feeling tired. It wasthe first and last time I had ever heard him say a word about himself,and I had known him for three years.It was at just 3 oclock and we were running only one wire. I wasnodding over reports at my desk and not paying much attention to himwhen he spoke.Jim, he said, does it feel close in here to you?Why, no, John, I answered, but Ill open a window if you like.Never mind, he said. I reckon Im just a little tired.That was all that was said and I went on working. Every ten minutes orso I would walk over and take a pile of copy that had stacked upneatly beside his typewriter as the messages were printed out intriplicate.It must have been twenty minutes after he spoke that I noticed he hadopened up the other wire and was using both typewriters. I thought itwas a little unusual, as there was nothing very hot coming in. On mynext trip I picked up the copy from both machines and took it back tomy desk to sort out the duplicates.The first wire was running out the usual sort of stuff and I justlooked over it hurriedly. Then I turned to the second pile of copy. Iremember it particularly because the story was from a town I had neverheard of: Xebico. Here is the dispatch. I saved a duplicate of itfrom our files:    Xebico Sept. 16 CP BULLETIN    The heaviest mist in the history of the city settled over the    town at 4 oclock yesterday afternoon. All traffic has stopped and    the mist hangs like a pall over everything. Lights of ordinary    intensity fail to pierce the fog, which is constantly growing    heavier.    Scientists here are unable to agree as to the cause, and the    local weather bureau states that the like has never occurred    before in the history of the city.    At 7 p. m. last night municipal authorities--(more)That was all there was. Nothing out of the ordinary at a bureauheadquarters, but, as I say, I noticed the story because of the nameof the town.It must have been fifteen minutes later that I went over for anotherbatch of copy. Morgan was slumped down in his chair and had switchedhis green electric light shade so that the gleam missed his eyes andhit only the top of the two typewriters.Only the usual stuff was in the right hand pile, but the left handbatch carried another story from Xebico. All press dispatches comein takes, meaning that parts of many different stories are strungalong together, perhaps with but a few paragraphs of each comingthrough at a time. This second story was marked add fog. Here is thecopy;    At 7 p. m. the fog had increased noticeably. All lights were now    invisible and the town was shrouded in pitch darkness.    As a peculiarity of the phenomenon, the fog is accompanied by a    sickly odor, comparable to nothing yet experienced here.Below that in customary press fashion was the hour, 3:27, and theinitials of the operator, JM.There was only one other story in the pile from the second wire. Hereit is:    2nd add Xebico Fog    Accounts as to the origin of the mist differ greatly. Among the    most unusual is that of the sexton of the local church, who groped    his way to headquarters in a hysterical condition and declared    that the fog originated in the village churchyard.    It was first visible in the shape of a soft gray blanket    clinging to the earth above the graves, he stated. Then it began    to rise, higher and higher. A subterranean breeze seemed to blow    it in billows, which split up and then joined together again.    Fog phantoms, writhing in anguish, twisted the mist into queer    forms and figures. And then--in the very thick midst of the    mass--something moved.    I turned and ran from the accursed spot. Behind me I heard    screams coming from the houses bordering on the graveyard.    Although the sextons story is generally discredited, a party has    left to investigate. Immediately after telling his story, the    sexton collapsed and is now in a local hospital, unconscious.Queer story, wasnt it? Not that we arent used to it, for a lot ofunusual stories come in over the wire. But for some reason or other,perhaps because it was so quiet that night, the report of the fog madea great impression on me.It was almost with dread that I went over to the waiting piles ofcopy. Morgan did not move and the only sound in the room was thetap-tap of the sounders. It was ominous, nerve-racking.There was another story from Xebico in the pile of copy. I seized onit anxiously.    New Lead Xebico Fog CP    The rescue party which went out at 11 p. m. to investigate a    weird story of the origin of a fog which, since late yesterday,    has shrouded the city in darkness, has failed to return. Another    and larger party has been dispatched.    Meanwhile the fog has, if possible, grown heavier. It seeps    through the cracks in the doors and fills the atmosphere with a    terribly depressing odor of decay. It is oppressive, terrifying,    bearing with it a subtle impression of things long dead.    Residents of the city have left their homes and gathered in the    local church, where the priests are holding services of prayer.    The scene is beyond description. Grown folk and children are alike    terrified and many are almost beside themselves with fear.    Mid the wisps of vapor which partially veil the church    auditorium, an old priest is praying for the welfare of his flock.    The audience alternately wail and cross themselves.    From the outskirts of the city may be heard cries of unknown    voices. They echo through the fog in queer uncadenced minor keys.    The sounds resemble nothing so much as wind whistling through a    gigantic tunnel. But the night is calm and there is no wind. The    second rescue party--(more)I am a calm man and never in a dozen years spent with the wires havebeen known to become excited, but despite myself I rose from my chairand walked to the window.Could I be mistaken, or far down in the canyons of the city beneath medid I see a faint trace of fog? Pshaw! It was all imagination.In the pressroom the click of the sounders seemed to have raised thetempo of their tune. Morgan alone had not stirred from his chair. Hishead sunk between his shoulders, he tapped the dispatches out on thetypewriters with one finger of each hand.He looked asleep. Maybe he was--but no, endlessly, efficiently, the twomachines rattled off line after line, as relentless and effortless asdeath itself. There was something about the monotonous movement of thetypewriter keys that fascinated me. I walked over and stood behind hischair reading over his shoulder the type as it came into being, wordby word.Ah, here was another:    Flash Xebico CP    There will be no more bulletins from this office. The impossible    has happened. No messages have come into this room for twenty    minutes. We are cut off from the outside and even the streets    below us.    I will stay with the wire until the end.    It is the end, indeed. Since 4 p. m. yesterday the fog has hung    over the city. Following reports from the sexton of the local    church, two rescue parties were sent out to investigate conditions    on the outskirts of the city. Neither party has ever returned nor    was any word received from them. It is quite certain now that they    will never return.    From my instrument I can gaze down on the city beneath me. From    the position of this room on the thirteenth floor, nearly the    entire city can be seen. Now I can see only a thick blanket of    blackness where customarily are lights and life.    I fear greatly that the wailing cries heard constantly from the    outskirts of the city are the death cries of the inhabitants. They    are constantly increasing in volume and are approaching the center    of the city.    The fog yet hangs over everything. If possible, it is even    heavier than before. But the conditions have changed. Instead of    an opaque, impenetrable wall of odorous vapor, now swirls and    writhes a shapeless mass in contortions of almost human agony. Now    and again the mass parts and I catch a brief glimpse of the    streets below.    People are running to and fro, screaming in despair. A vast    bedlam of sound flies up to my window, and above all is the    immense whistling of unseen and unfelt winds.    The fog has again swept over the city and the whistling is coming    closer and closer.    It is now directly beneath me.    God! An instant ago the mist opened and I caught a glimpse of the    streets below.    The fog is not simply vapor--it lives. By the side of each    moaning and weeping human is a companion figure, an aura of    strange and varicolored hues. How the shapes cling! Each to a    living thing!    The men and women are down. Flat on their faces. The fog figures    caress them lovingly. They are kneeling beside them. They are--but    I dare not tell it.    The prone and writhing bodies have been stripped of their    clothing. They are being consumed--piecemeal.    A merciful wall of hot, steamy vapor has swept over the whole    scene. I can see no more.    Beneath me the wall of vapor is changing colors. It seems to be    lighted by internal fires. No, it isnt. I have made a mistake.    The colors are from above, reflections from the sky.    Look up! Look up! The whole sky is in flames. Colors as yet    unseen by man or demon. The flames are moving, they have started    to intermix, the colors rearrange themselves. They are so    brilliant that my eyes burn, yet they are a long way off.    Now they have begun to swirl, to circle in and out, twisting in    intricate designs and patterns. The lights are racing each with    each, a kaleidoscope of unearthly brilliance.    I have made a discovery. There is nothing harmful in the lights.    They radiate force and friendliness, almost cheeriness. But by    their very strength, they hurt.    As I look they are swinging closer and closer, a million miles at    each jump. Millions of miles with the speed of light. Aye, it is    light, the quintessence of all light. Beneath it the fog melts    into a jeweled mist, radiant, rainbow-colored of a thousand varied    spectrums.    I can see the streets. Why, they are filled with people! The    lights are coming closer. They are all around me. I am enveloped.    I----The message stopped abruptly. The wire to Xebico was dead. Beneath myeyes in the narrow circle of light from under the green lampshade, theblack printing no longer spun itself, letter by letter, across thepage.The room seemed filled with a solemn quiet, a silence vaguelyimpressive. Powerful.I looked down at Morgan. His hands had dropped nervelessly at hissides while his body had hunched over peculiarly. I turned thelampshade back, throwing the light squarely in his face. His eyes werestaring, fixed. Filled with a sudden foreboding, I stepped beside himand called Chicago on the wire. After a second the sounder clicked itsanswer.Why? But there was something wrong. Chicago was reporting that WireTwo had not been used throughout the evening.Morgan! I shouted. Morgan! Wake up, it isnt true. Someone has beenhoaxing us. Why---- In my eagerness I grasped him by the shoulder. Itwas only then that I understood.The body was quite cold. Morgan had been dead for hours. Could it bethat his sensitized brain and automatic fingers had continued torecord impressions even after the end?I shall never know, for I shall never again handle the night shift.Search in a world atlas discloses no town of Xebico. Whatever it wasthat killed John Morgan will forever remain a mystery.[Transcribers Note: This story appeared in the September 1926 issueof Weird Tales.]
