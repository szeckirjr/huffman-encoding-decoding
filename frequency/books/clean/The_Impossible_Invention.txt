                       The Impossible Invention                       By Robert Moore Williams           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                    Astonishing Stories, June 1942.         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]I had to admire this little guy's courage. Fradin, his name was--JamesArthur Fradin, with a string of letters after it that even thealphabet agencies down at Washington could not have unscrambled. Theletters represented honorary degrees conferred on him by half a dozendifferent colleges, and they should have entitled him to be heard withrespectful consideration, but they weren't. The assembled scientists ofthe Institute of Radio Engineers were giving him merry hell."What you are saying, Fradin," one of the scientists interrupted hotly,"is gross nonsense.""It is absolutely impossible," another shouted."Faker!" somebody yelled, and a dozen voices took it up until the roomechoed with the sound.I sat back and grinned to myself. If this meeting ended in afree-for-all fight, which was what looked like was due to happen, Iwould be able to make a swell human interest humorous yarn out of it.My editor went for human interest stuff, which was largely why he hadsent me down to cover this meeting. He knew I wasn't likely to developany front page news here, scientific meetings being what they are. Butthere might be a human interest angle that would be good for a laugh.And the way these solemn scientists were calling Fradin a liar, itlooked like the laugh was coming.There was one man who wasn't doing any name calling, I noticed, a tall,cadaverous-looking individual sitting two seats down from me. He hadlistened very carefully, almost eagerly, I thought, to everything thespeaker had said. Glancing at him, I got the impression that I shouldknow him, but at the moment I couldn't place him. Tall, bony face,thin, hawk nose--yes, it seemed I should know him.Fradin had stopped speaking when the storm of abuse broke over him. Hestood there on the platform, a little, white haired guy with a gentleface."If you numbskulls will only be quiet for a moment," he said, when thenoise had subsided for an instant, "I will offer incontrovertible proofto support my statement that radio waves are transmitted through whatI must, for lack of a better term to describe the undescribable, callthe fourth dimension."What I mean, the roof must have been nailed down tight, or theexplosion that followed would certainly have lifted it off thebuilding. You never did see so many excited scientists in one group.Normally a scientist is supposed to be cool, aloof, and impersonal.But this group was anything else! They went right straight up in theair. I couldn't tell whether they were angrier because he had calledthem a bunch of numbskulls or because he had said that radio waves weretransmitted through the fourth dimension.       *       *       *       *       *One of them leaped to his feet. Ramsen, I think his name was. He was abig shot in the field, almost as big as De Forest and Marconi."Fradin," he yelled, "that is the most preposterous statement I everheard from the lips of any man in his right senses. It raises theimmediate question of whether or not _you_ are in your right senses."There was a buzz of approval following his statement. Fradin waited forit to die down."Mr. Ramsen," he said, "you have chosen to challenge my theory.Perhaps you can tell me what medium _does_ carry the electro-magneticradiations that we call radio waves?""Certainly," Ramsen answered. "Any schoolboy knows that.""We are not here concerned with the knowledge of schoolboys," Fradingently replied. "Sound is carried in air and water and by many solidsubstances. But we know that radio waves do not travel in air, becausethey will pass through a perfect vacuum. In what medium do they travel,Mr. Ramsen?"Right here was where I began to pay close attention. Something aboutFradin's manner, his calmness, his certainty, gave me the impressionthat he knew pretty much what he was talking about."Radio waves, Mr. Fradin," Ramsen answered, in the manner of ascoutmaster revealing the facts of life to an errant Boy Scout, "travelin the ether."He was right. I was not assigned to cover this meeting by chance butbecause I happen to have a pretty good groundwork in science. Radiowaves, all scientists admit, are propagated through the ether."And what," Fradin countered, "is the ether?""Why--" Ramsen answered. "It's--" He started to flounder. A suddensilence fell in the room. Ramsen's face started to get red. "Theether," he finished, "is--why it's the ether, that's what it is.""What you are refusing to admit," Fradin crowed, "is that 'ether' isa meaningless word invented by numbskulls such as are gathered hereto describe something about which they know absolutely nothing. Theether is a word, nothing more. It does not exist. The Michelson-Morleyexperiments conclusively proved that, if it existed, its naturewas such that it could not be detected by any physical experimentwhatsoever. In other words, that it exists only as a handy tool bywhich scientists who ought to know better can conceal their ownignorance. Gentlemen," he said, turning from the red-faced Ramsen tothe perturbed audience, "I can not only conclusively prove that radiowaves are transmitted through the fourth dimension--but I can alsoprove that power, actual power, can also be transmitted through thesame medium!"He stopped suddenly, biting his lips as if he had said more than hehad intended to. But I think only one man in the audience had caughtthe full implication of Fradin's words. The rest of them were too busydefending themselves against the accusation of being numbskulls tonotice the one really important thing he had said.How that audience did boil! And they boiled because every man jack ofthem, in his heart of hearts, knew that Fradin was right. I knew it theminute he said it. And they knew it too. When he said that "ether" wasonly a word used by fools to conceal their own ignorance, he had hitthe nail exactly on the head.For that is precisely what it is. Nobody has ever seen the ether, feltit, smelled it, heard it, touched it. Scientists of the past century,needing a mechanical device to account for the observed propagation ofelectro-magnetic radiations such as light and the then little knownradio waves, had invented the ether to carry those radiations, inventedit out of whole cloth. Fradin's hearers knew he was right. Takenindividually, when they were calm, they would have admitted it. Butthey were in a group and he was calling them fools right out in public.Mass hysteria got them. They boiled over and very promptly demandedthat he prove his statements.He refused to do it. Absolutely refused.       *       *       *       *       *"We demand that you produce your proof," Ramsen howled. "You havecalled us fools and said you could prove it. We demand that you _do_prove it.""I--" Fradin began. He wet his lips. His face had whitened. It wasn't agentle, kindly face any more. It was the face of a badly scared man.Fradin was scared. But he wasn't scared of those engineers who wereshouting at him. He was scared of something else."Speak up," Ramsen roared. "Produce your proof!""I can show you mathematical proof," Fradin offered.How they howled at that, all except the tall, thin, hawk-nosedindividual sitting two seats down from me. He took no part in thedemonstration. Instead he got up and very quietly went out of the room.As he walked out, I again got the impression that I ought to know him.But I still couldn't place him. A reporter sees too many people toremember all of them."Mathematical proof, unless supported by incontrovertible experimentalevidence, is not sufficient," Ramsen thundered. "We demand that youproduce experimental proof."By experimental proof, he meant an actual instrument of some kind todemonstrate Fradin's claims--some gadget that they could see and feeland examine, something they could take apart and put back togetheragain, something that they could watch in operation. Ramsen was quiteright in making such a demand, for without experimental evidence toback it up, mathematical theory is more often than not just so much hotair."Your demand is just," Fradin faltered. "I fear in the heat of argumentI made statements I do not care to support. I do not choose to producethe experimental evidence that I have."He didn't say another word. Instead, he turned and walked off theplatform, going out through a door at the back. Nor did he enter thelecture hall where the meeting was being held. He walked out of theroom.And he didn't come back.Why had he refused to produce the evidence that he had? What had scaredhim?Questions were buzzing like gadflies in my mind. There was oneparticularly persistent gadfly. Fradin had said something of whichI had almost caught the significance. Almost, but not quite. Thesignificant thing he had said kept buzzing in the back of my mind, butI couldn't quite put a mental finger on it....Then I remembered it.I went out of that room at a dead run. I went up over the speaker'splatform and through the door Fradin had taken. How I did want to talkto that tortured man!What he had said, letting it slip accidentally, added up to one ofthe biggest stories that ever splashed across the front page of anewspaper. I had come down here looking for a human interest yarn.Instead I had run straight into a story that could easily set the worldon fire, _if_ I could find Fradin and make him talk.I didn't doubt that I would find him. He couldn't have gotten far away.He hadn't had time. Not five minutes had passed after he had walked offthe platform until I was following him.The door opened into a long hall, and in that hall I found Fradin.He was down at the far end, getting into an elevator. A tall, thinindividual was with him.I sprinted down the hall to try to catch them before the elevator doorsclosed. The operator saw me coming and started to wait for me, butsomething changed his mind for him. The two men were already in thecage; I couldn't be positive of it, but I thought the tall man saidsomething to the operator. Just as I got there, the operator slammedthe door in my face. The cage started down."All right, smart guy," I yelled at the operator. "I'll give you asmack in the snoot for this."Probably I could have gotten down faster by waiting for anotherelevator, but there was a stairway and I used that. I was in a hurry.       *       *       *       *       *I got to the first floor just in time to see Fradin and his companionwalk out of the front door."Hey!" I yelled. "Wait--"I started to say, "Wait for me," but the words were choked off in mythroat. I recognized Fradin's companion. The hawk-faced man who had sattwo seats down from me and who had slipped unobtrusively out of themeeting. He had gone around to the back of the hall and joined Fradin.But the fact that he was with Fradin wasn't the thing that had chokedoff my call. It was the way the two men were walking. Fradin was alittle ahead, and he wasn't looking to the right or the left. Justwalking. There was a stiffness about him that made me think of amechanical toy that has been wound up and is taking a walk for itself.Hawk-face was following right behind him. Hawk-face had his hand in hispocket. I didn't need to look twice to know that he had a gun in thatpocket too, pointing straight at the little inventor's back.It wasn't a stick-up. It was a kidnap job. Hawk-face had also heardthe really important thing that Fradin had said in his speech. I hadmissed it for a few minutes, but he hadn't missed it. He had instantlyrealized how damned important it was. He had walked out of the meeting,gone around to the back, waited for the scientist.I should have called the police. But just then something happened thatupset me so badly I completely forgot all about police.I recognized Hawk-face, and cold chills began to run up and down myspine.His name--or at least the name attached to the picture I had onceseen in the hands of an F.B.I. man--was Marvak. The name didn't meananything. He had others. A name to use in Asia, one for Russia, one forEurope, all different.Marvak was one of the names he used in America, but the F.B.I.suspected he had others. They would cheerfully have hung him by any ofhis names, if they could have caught him, but he didn't catch easily.Compared to him, an eel was a rank amateur in slipperiness, and arattlesnake was man's best friend.Right out in front of the building, on a crowded city street, he forcedFradin into a cab. I was so close I could see the haunted, terrifiedexpression on the little scientist's face. But I didn't think then andI know now that he wasn't afraid of the gun. He was afraid of somethingeven more horrible than Marvak.The cab pulled away.An eternity seemed to pass before I could collect my faculties and grabthe next cab in line."Follow that cab," I hissed at the hacker. "There's a ten-spot in itfor you if you don't lose it."He didn't lose it. We followed Fradin and Marvak down to an old,abandoned factory building on the outskirts of the city. They weregetting out of their cab when we drove up. Marvak, with his right handstill in his coat pocket, was paying off the driver."Drive on past," I told my driver.He went on past and around the block and I got out, but the driver hadto remind me about the ten-spot I had promised him. I paid off like aslot machine.       *       *       *       *       *That shows how excited I was. I had stopped thinking about the story Imight get. The story was secondary now. What really mattered was thatFradin had to be rescued, and fast. The thing he had let slip was toobig to fall into Marvak's hands under any circumstances. And I had tobe the one who rescued him. There wasn't time to go for the police.Marvak would work fast.Marvak did work fast.I tried the front door first because that was the obvious thing to do.If I got caught coming in the front door I could say I had the wrongaddress and back out. But if I got caught at the back door, no amountof explanation would do me any good.The front door was unlocked. It opened into what had once been anoffice. A flight of stairs led up to the second floor.I listened--there wasn't a sound. "They went upstairs," I thought."Hold it, bud," a voice said behind me.The voice had a chilled steel ring that sent my heart right down intomy shoes. There was no mercy in it, no compassion, no pity. It wasdouble-edged with the threat of death. It jerked my head around.Marvak was standing there in the office. He had the gun out of hispocket now, pointing it straight at me.There was a closet in the office. Marvak had simply waited in thecloset until I entered. When I started up the stairs, he had steppedout behind me."I--I must have got the wrong ad--address," I faltered.His eyes, gray chilled steel, they were, drilled into me."No doubt," he said--but very doubtfully. "You're the reporter Inoticed at the meeting, aren't you? What are you doing here?"How big a lie could I tell and still be safe? How close to the truthcould I come and not get one of those slugs between my eyes?"I came out to interview Mr. Fradin," I blurted out.He seemed to let it go, but back of those cold gray eyes I could seehis mind working as he decided what to do with me. Then I saw him reacha decision.First, he searched me. I didn't have a gun, which seemed to surprisehim."You can come along," he said. "If Fradin can demonstrate to mysatisfaction the discovery he claimed to have made, it will make theheadlines, _if_ you get a chance to write it."With that, he dug the little inventor out of the closet, and with thegun out, prodded both of us upstairs. There were only two floors tothis building and the entire second floor was Fradin's laboratory.       *       *       *       *       *It was crammed to the ceiling with the weirdest collection ofelectrical equipment I have ever seen. Generators, dynamos, electricmotors. There was enough radio equipment to set up a modestbroadcasting station. And in one corner was something big enough to bea cyclotron. Fradin had just about everything in his laboratory."Now," said Marvak to the little inventor, "you will please prove thetruth of your assertion that power can be transmitted by radio."That was the thing that Fradin had said. Power by radio! It doesn'tsound like much, but let me tell you, it's plenty big. With it, sciencecould come darned close to remaking the face of the globe.How?This is the power age. Practically all of our industrialachievements--and through them we have achieved what passes forcivilization--have come about through cheap power. Coal, the steamengine, the dynamo, water power. Maybe, not so long in the future,we'll have atomic power, but we don't have it yet. All we have now arecoal and water. And possibly 90% of the water power in this country andprobably 95% of the water power on earth are going to waste, simplybecause the waterfalls are usually in mountains and the places wherethe current is to be used are in cities hundreds and even thousandsof miles away. _Transmission losses over high lines are so great thatelectrical energy cannot be efficiently transmitted very far._ So thewater power goes to waste.But here we have radio transmitted power. No high lines, hence no highline losses. Of course there would be other losses, but if Fradin saidpower could be transmitted by radio, he would know how to cure thelosses. Radio transmitted power would make electricity so damned cheapthat every home in the country could have it.And this is only part of the picture that Fradin's invention broughtinto being. Supposing power could be transmitted by radio. Supposeautomobiles could pick it up and use it. Then the extremely expensiveinternal combustion engine that goes into every car could be replacedby cheap motors. The price of cars could be cut in half. Everybodycould have one. And operation costs would be next to nothing.Ocean liners? No more bully, costly steam engines. Boats could taketheir power out of the air.And airplanes. There was the most important item of all. No gasolineengines in planes, no engine failures, no crashes because the motorconked out. Air flight spanning the globe.That's what radio transmitted power ought to mean, that's what it wouldmean--until Marvak entered the picture. When he appeared on the scene,power by radio, instead of being a blessing, would become one of theworst disasters that ever happened to humanity.Marvak was a spy. Not a common, garden variety of spy, not a fifthcolumnist, not a saboteur, but a sort of super-spy who sold hisservices to the highest bidder. If you wanted a war started, he couldmake all the arrangements to provide for an "incident." If you wantedto take over a minor nation, he could pave the way for you; if yourenemy had a new and secret weapon, he could get the plans. Anything,just so he was well paid for it.If Fradin could really transmit power by radio, and if Marvak gotthe plans, the waterfalls would not be harnessed, there wouldn't becheap automobiles, and handy power for ocean liners. There would bepower--unfailing power--for one thing: planes! Bombing planes, fightingplanes!If you think several nations on this globe would not jump at the chanceto acquire such an invention, you have another think coming. And theprice they would be willing to pay for it, would be big enough tointerest even Marvak. It would be worth--well, what is the worth ofthe British Empire, China, and the United States?Fradin's invention had exactly the same value as those three nationslumped together, if Marvak succeeded in peddling it in Europe. Bombersover New York, bombers over Chicago. There would no longer be anysafety in three thousand miles of water. Bombers over London. Newbombers that would be almost invincible.       *       *       *       *       *Sweat was running down over my face, down over my body, down over mysoul. If Marvak got Fradin's invention, Johnny Holmes--that's me--gohunt for an air-raid shelter, because you're sure going to need it."I was mistaken," Fradin faltered, his voice a whisper. "Iwas--boasting. I cannot transmit power by radio.""You're a liar!" Marvak snapped."I'm not a liar," Fradin whispered."Either or else," Marvak said, bringing up his gun until it pointedright at the little inventor's forehead.Fradin had something that a man could call courage. He looked that gunin the eye. His face went a shade whiter, but his eyes did not drop."I'm afraid it will have to be else," he said. As he spoke the words,he seemed to stiffen himself until he stood very straight. He lookedlike a soldier standing at attention. "But if you shoot me you may findit difficult to operate my invention."Marvak's finger tightened around the trigger. His face was cold withrage, his grey, killer eyes looked like icicles."Don't shoot him, you fool!" I hissed. "Then you'll never find out whatyou want to know."I was stalling for time, stalling for anything, stalling for a chanceto jump that gun. I was standing beside Fradin, but the gun coveredboth of us."Shut up!" Marvak snarled at me.The gun went off.He had shot Fradin. It was cold blooded murder. But as he had shot thelittle scientist, he had taken his eyes off me. I started to jump. Thegun instantly swung to cover me. I saw Marvak's face, with no mercy init. The gun froze me motionless.Fradin didn't fall. There was a look of surprise on his face, but hedidn't fall. Then I saw what had happened. Marvak had shot him in theshoulder instead of through his head."That's just a sample," Marvak said, "to show you that I mean business.You're not badly hurt, but the next one will go through your knee-cap.I understand that a bullet through the knee is very painful. Now areyou going to tell me what I want to know or are you going to needfurther persuasion?"Blood was running down Fradin's coat. He was clutching his shoulderwith the other hand, trying to stop the flow of blood. His face wasvery white. And now there was fear on it, fear that had not been therewhen he first faced Marvak's gun. I got the fleeting impression thatit was not fear of the spy nor of the weapon, but of something else. Ialso got the impression that it was a terrible fear, a soul-consumingfear, a bleaching, whitening, shuddering fear, a fear greater even thanthe fear of death...."All right," the little inventor whispered. "You win. I'll show youwhat you want.""That's better," Marvak said, in a satisfied tone. "I don't mind sayingthat if I make a cleaning on this, I'm quite willing to cut you and thereporter in on it."He was lying. The only way he would cut us in would be to cut ourthroats. Both Fradin and I knew it."I'm afraid," the inventor said, "that your shot has injured my arm sobadly that I will have to ask you to help me.""Okay," Marvak said. "But remember I have an excellent knowledge ofelectrical apparatus, so don't try any tricks, like electrocuting me byaccident.""There won't be any trickery involved here," the little inventorwhispered through bloodless lips.       *       *       *       *       *I watched. There were two bulky instruments, one of them a transmitter,the other a receiver. The current flow was seemingly directional. Itwas sent out from the transmitter and caught by the receiver. Therewas a meter on the transmitter to show how much current was beingtransmitted and another on the receiver to show how much was gettingthrough.There was a red line on the dial of the meter at the transmitter.The purpose of the set-up was obviously to demonstrate that currentcould be transmitted by radio.Marvak made a complete examination of the apparatus. He knew what hewas doing, all right. You could tell from the way he went over theinstruments that he knew his stuff."I'm not interested in transmitting just a little power," Marvaksaid. "If this thing is to be useful, it must be able to send lots ofkilowatts through the ether.""I think," Fradin answered wearily, "it will handle all the power youchoose to put into it."That was the thing Marvak had to know, that the power transmitted wouldbe adequate to keep a plane in the air. If only a little power wastransmitted, the invention, from a practical viewpoint, was useless. Nodictator would give a cent for it.Marvak handled the transmitter, Fradin tried to operate the receiverand to stanch the flow of blood from his shoulder at the same time.Marvak turned a switch, and the power transmitter began to throb underthe load. Marvak consulted the meter on the transmitter, then ranacross the room to the receiver and examined the meter there."You've really got it!" he exulted. "There's enough power flowingthrough the receiver to keep a plane in the air."I was sick, sicker than I had ever been. Fradin's invention worked. Andwhen it worked, it spelled our doom. We would be killed, because itworked. How many millions of others would also die, I could not beginto guess."One plane is not enough," Marvak said. "It has to be strong enough tosupply current to a fleet of planes."He started triumphantly back to the transmitter."I--" Fradin faltered. He started to say something but changed his mindabruptly.Marvak kicked over the handle of the rheostat that fed current into thetransmitter. The transformer groaned. I could see the hand of the meteron the transmitter. It was moving forward as more and more currentflowed into that mysterious medium that transmits radio waves.The needle on the dial touched the red mark.Then--it happened.If I live to be a thousand years old I'll never be able to describeadequately what I saw happen, what I heard happen, what I felt happen.It had never happened before.Something that I can only describe as a lightning flash ran throughthe room. It was a sharp, tearing crash, similar to the sound you hearwhen a bolt of lightning hits near you. There was a flash of brilliantlight. Thunder seemed to smash my ear drums.Fradin leaped--but not at Marvak. He leaped at me. The next instant hewas grabbing me, shoving me across the room. And all the tortures ofhell were breaking loose around that generator.       *       *       *       *       *There was a blasting, howling roar of wind. It was the coldest windever. It was, I suspect, the cold of absolute zero that struck throughthat laboratory.Out of nowhere, around that transmitter, a hole seemed to appear. Itseemed to be torn in space. It was black, with a curiously liquid kindof blackness. It appeared around the transmitter, and Marvak was at thetransmitter.The spy seemed to freeze. A look of amazed fright appeared on his face.[Illustration]Then he seemed to fall. The transmitter seemed to fall with him. Marvaktried to leap, but the footing seemed to fall away under him. He fellout of sight.For a mad instant, while Fradin kicked and hauled me away from thattransmitter, the laboratory was hideous with the blast of thunder.Then another murderous crash came, and....Then there was silence. Utter silence. The only sound was Fradinfighting for his breath. I looked across the room. The transmitter wasgone. It just wasn't there any more. Under it, in the floor of the roomwas a neat, round hole. All the mass of wires that had led into itwere neatly severed. Wires came from the transformer to where the holebegan, then stopped.Marvak wasn't there. Marvak was gone.Suddenly I turned to Fradin. "You--" I gulped. "You were afraid thiswould happen. My God, man, what was it?""It was," he answered, "a hole in the fourth dimension."Then I got it. He had been trying to tell that convention of radioengineers that radio waves were transmitted through the fourthdimension, not through the "ether." He had been able to prove his pointbut he had refused because he knew that this would happen."But even if radio waves do pass through the fourth dimension, nothinglike this has ever happened," I stammered."Ordinary broadcasting stations do not put enough power through theirtransmitters to open this hole," he explained. "It takes power to doit, lots of power. I had calculated how much power it would take.There was a red mark on the input meter of the transmitter. Thatred line marked the critical point. If more power was put throughthe transmitter, it would break down the fabric of space betweenthis dimension and the fourth dimension. I knew it would happen.That's why I refused to make a demonstration for the benefit of myskeptical compatriots. If I told them what I had discovered, proved Ihad discovered it, some fool would be sure to try it, with disastrousresults.""But that cold wind," I protested."This particular region opens out into what must be interplanetaryspace in the fourth dimension. That cold wind was simply the cold ofouter space rushing through what was in effect a window."So that was it. There was a hole in space. And space is cold."Marvak!" I said weakly."Don't mention him," Fradin shuddered. "He was catapulted into thefourth dimension. He's frozen solid by now."I guess the human race will never have power by radio. Probably we willbe able to get along without it. Atomic power seems to be coming along,and it's safe.I took Fradin to the hospital. That slug through his shoulder had costhim a lot of blood, but he recovered all right, only to discover thatthe Institute of Radio Engineers had booted him right out of theirorganization, for making the preposterous claim that radio waves aretransmitted through the fourth dimension instead of through the ether.However, he never cared two whoops in hell about that. He knew what heknew. And he was content with that.
