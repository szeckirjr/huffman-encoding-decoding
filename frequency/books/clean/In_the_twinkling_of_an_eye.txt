Butyour latest story has sadly undeceived us, as regards your usefulness asa worker in the great cause we are pledged to uphold and further. On _pp_ of your last story, you make your hero, returning from a days runwith the hounds, come upon a woman lying in a lonely place, who has beeninjured in a trap accident. You say, speaking of your heros prompt helpto the woman, that taking his hunting flask from his pocket, he forceda few drops of the brandy between the womans lips, etc. Now, sir, wecontend that had you had the cause of Total-abstinence fully at heart,you would have made that huntsmans flask to have contained _water_.So much for the letter. The moral of it lies on the surface. There aresome persons who seem unable to see anything from the side of _real,actual_ lifethat Ladies committee could notwhose vision is narroweddown to the tiny slit of their own cramped, cabined life and thought,they have no true _out_look upon life, as a whole.I preface this foreword with the above incident, because I am perfectlycertain that the standpoint from which I have written this book will beutterly, absolutely misunderstood by many earnest, loving-hearted people,whose eyes, with my own, have caught the _up_ward gaze from whence welook for the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.I would at once acknowledge that the inceptive idea of writing such abook as this was born within me from reading Long Odds, that wondrouslittle half-penny booklet written by the late General Robertson, Ibelieve, a booklet that has been so marvellously owned and blessed.For five or six years the idea for this present volume has been simmeringand seething in my mind. The first and only real problem I had to face inthe matter was that of the _principle_ involved in using the fictionalform to clothe so sacred a subject (for, to me, the near Return of ourLord is the _most_ sacred of all subjects.) But the problem of the_principle_ was speedily settled, as I remembered how wondrously God hadowned and blessed Long Odds, in which the fictional is the vehicle ofthe teaching.Then, too, there are, I know, myriads of people into whose hands LongOdds, could never, by any chance, fallfor there are multitudes whowill not so much as glance at, or touch a tract, while a volume willeasily win its way among all classes. There is an enormous percentage ofattendants at our churches and chapels, and many otherwise very earnestChristian workers, to whom the whole subject of the Lords Second Comingis an absolutely unknown realm of Truthand these I would fain reach andarouse with the message of this book.To those Christians who are looking for the Return of the Lord, towhom the subject is the most tenderly sacred of all subjects, who willat first sight condemn the use of the fictional element, the dramaticcolour in this bookand many good people will, I am assuredI wouldsay, first, that the book is not written for them, and second, that,our Lord Himself, speaking of His own Return, used two very remarkableillustrations from lifes strangest dramas. First, _As it was in thedays of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, untilTHE DAY_, etc. Now, think what a myriad _dramas_ were being enactedwhen the flood came. And had the disciples asked their Lord, privately,after His utterance, to explain more fully what He meant, what thrillingstories He _could_, He _doubtless WOULD have sketched_. If any Christiancavils at the dramatic in this book, I would refer him or her to Christsown pointing in the picture of Noahs time, then bid them fill out, byhelp of the feeblest, simplest imagination, the picture of the myriaddramas that were being enacted when that flood came, of old time. Then,if the objector is honest, and is _capable_ of the least imagination, hewill say I see! and, now that I see this fact, my wonder is _not_ thatthere is a certain dramatic freedom in this book, but that the writer haskept so powerful a restraint upon his pen.Again, Christ said:_As it was in the days of LOT_, etc. Now think over_this_ saying of our Lords, and remembering what is actually recordedin Genesis, of the _vice_ and _crime_ of Sodom, (and how, alas! evenwhen saved from the doomed city, Lot and his daughters brought away muchof the vicious, criminal essence of the place with them,) think how theReturn of our Lord, presently, will mean the snatching away of many ofHis own out of scenes infinitely more awful than anything I have usedherein, or ever hinted at. A book written on the subject here chosen,and written in the vein our Lord Himself suggests in the two passagesreferred to above, could not have been written in any other wayto betrue to life, and to the subject.Should any reader object to the expository lectures of Major H, asthe chief vehicle for the doctrinal teaching, I would say that personalexperience has proved the style to be infinitely more acceptable toreaders than that of the dialogue mode.I have purposely placed special emphasis on the Jewish side of thesubject, since the Jewish question is infinitely more closely enwrappedwith the fact of our Lords near return, than many speakers and writersgive prominence to.

He was moody andstern. His eyes showed his disappointment and perplexity. At times, abouthis mouth there lurked an almost savage expression. As a rule he stoodand walked erect. Only the day before this incident one of a knot offlower-girls in Drury Lane had drawn the attention of her companions tohim as he strode briskly along the pavement, and in a rollicking spirithad sung, as he passed her:    Stiff, starch, straight as a larch,    Every inch a soldier;    Fond o his country, fond o his queen,    An hawfully fond o me.But to-day there is nothing of the soldier in the pose or gait of TomHammond.Yet the time and place ought to have held his attention sufficiently tohave kept him alert to outward appearance. It was eleven in the forenoon.The place was Piccadilly. He came abreast of Swan and Edgars. Thepavement was thronged with women on shopping bent. More than one of themshot an admiring glance at him, for he had the face, the head, of a kingamong men. But he had no eyes for these chance admirers.Tom Hammond was thirty years of age, a journalist, and an exceptionallyclever one, at the time we make his acquaintance. He was a keen, shrewdman, was gifted with a foresight and general prescience that were almostremarkable, and hence was commonly regarded by his journalistic friendsas a coming man. He had strongly-fixed ideas of what a great dailypaper should be, but never having seen any attempt that came withinleagues of his ideal, he longedlusted would not be too strong a termforthe time and opportunity when, with practically unlimited capital behindhim, and with a perfectly free hand to use it, he could issue his idealjournal.This morning he seems farther from the goal of his hopes than ever. Fortwo years he had been sub-editor of a London daily that had made foritself a great nameof a sort. There were certain reasons which hadprompted him to hope, to expect, the actual editorship before long. Butnow his house of cards had suddenly tumbled about his ears.A change had recently taken place in the composition of the syndicatethat financed the journal. There were wheels within wheels, the existenceof some of which he had never once guessed, and which in their whirlinghad suddenly produced unexpected results. The editor-in-chief hadresigned, and the newly elected editor proved to be a man who had, yearsbefore, done him, Tom Hammond, the foulest wrong one journalist can do toanother.Under the present circumstances there had been no honourable course openfor Hammond but to resign. That morning he had found his resignation notonly accepted, but he found himself practically dismissed.Enclosed in the letter of acceptance of his resignation was a chequecovering the term of his notice, together with the intimation that hisservices would cease from the time of his receipt of the cheque.His dejection, at that moment when we meet him, was caused not so much atfinding himself out of employment as from the consciousness that the neweditor-elect had accomplished this move with a view to his degradation inthe eyes of his professionin fact, out of sheer spite.To escape the crowd that almost blocked the pavement in front of Swan andEdgars windows, he turned sharply into the road, and literally ran intothe arms of a young man.Tom Hammond!George Carlyon!The greeting flew simultaneously from the lips of the two men. Theygripped hands.By all thats wonderful! cried Carlyon, still wringing his friendshand. Do you know, Tom, I am actually up here in town for one purposeonlyto hunt you up.To hunt me up!Oh, lets get out of this crush, old man, interrupted Carlyon.The pair steered their way through the traffic, crossed the Circus,stopped for a moment at the beautiful Shaftesbury Fountain, then struckacross to the Avenue. In the comparative lull of that walk Carlyon wenton:Yes, Ive run up to town this morning to find you out and ask you onequestion: Are you so fixed upexcuse the Americanism, old boy. Ive adashing little girl cousin, from the States, staying with my mother,andwell, you know, old fellow, how it is. Mans an imitative creature,and all that, and absorbs dialect quicker than anything else under thesun. But what I was going to say was this: are you too fixed up with yourpresent newspaper to forbid your entertaining the thought of a real plumin the journalistic market?Hammonds customary alert look returned to his face. He was now everyinch a soldier, as he cried, excitedly, Dont keep me in suspense,Carlyon; tell me quickly what you mean.Lets jump into a gondola, Tom. I can talk better as we ride.Carlyon had caught the eye of a cab-driver, and the next moment the twofriends were being driven along riverwards.Someone, some Johnnie or other, began Carlyon, as the two men settledthemselves back in the cab, once called the hansom cab the gondola ofLondons streetsHe caught the quick, impatient movement of Hammonds face, and with alight laugh went on:But youre on thorns, old boy, to hear about the journalistic plum.Well, here goes. You once met my uncle, Sir Archibald Carlyon?Hammond nodded.He is crazy to start a daily, said Carlyon. It is no new craze withhim; he has been itching to do it for years. And now that gold has beendiscovered on that land of his in Western Australia, and he is likely tobe a multi-millionairethe concessions he has already sold have givenhim a clear million,now that he is rich beyond all his dreams, he wontwait another day; he will be a newspaper proprietor. Its a case of thatkiddie in the bath, Tom, doncher-know, thats grabbing for the soaphewont be happy till he gets it.He wants to find at once a good journalist, who is also a keen businessman; one who will take hold of the whole thing. To the right man he willgive a perfectly free hand, will interfere with nothing, but be contentsimply to finance the affair.An almost fierce light was burning in the eyes of the eager, listeningHammond. A thousand thoughts rioted through his brain, but he uttered noword; he would not interrupt his friend.I told Nunkums last night, when he was bubbling and boiling over withhis project, that I had heard you say it was easier to drop a hundred ortwo hundred thousand pounds over the starting of a new paper than perhapsover any other venture in the world.Nunkums just smiled as I spoke, dropped a walnut into his port glass,and said quietly, Then Ill drop them.He hooked that walnut out of his wine with the miniature silverboathookhe had the thing made for him for the purpose,devoured thewine-saturated nut, then smiled back into my face, as he said: Yes,Georgie, I am quite prepared to drop my hundred, two hundred, threehundred thousand, if needs be, as I did my walnut. But I am equallyhopefulif I can secure the right man to edit and manage my paper,that Ishall eventually hook out an excellent dividend for my outlay. I want aman who not only knows how to do his own work well, as an editor, but onewho has the true instinct in choosing his staff.Of course, Tom, I trotted you out before him. He remembered you, ofcourse, and jumped at the idea of getting you, if you were to be got.The upshot of it is, nothing would satisfy him but that I should comeup by an early train this morningearly bird catches the worm, and allthat kind of business, you know,and now, in spite of the fact that myparticular worm had wriggled and squirmed miles from his usual habitat,Ive caught him. Now, tell me, are you open to treat with Sir Archibald?Yes, and can begin business this very day! Hammond laughed with theabandon of a boy, as he told, in a few sentences, the story of hisdismissal.Good! Carlyon, in his own exuberant glee, slapped his friends knee.Sir Archibald, he went on, was to come up by the 10:05 from our place,due at Waterloo at 11:49. Hell be fixed upHail Columbia! againat thehotel by this time. Thats where we are driving to now, andah! here weare!A moment later the two men were mounting the hotel steps. One of theservants standing in the vestibule recognized Carlyon, and saluted him.My uncle arrived, Bates? Carlyon asked.Yes, sir, and a young lady with him!Carlyon turned quickly to Hammond.Thats Madge, my American cousin, Tom. Im awfully glad she has come; Ishould like you to know her.Turning to the servant, he asked, Same old rooms, Bates?Yes, sir.Three steps at a time, laughing and talking all the while, Carlyon,ignoring the lift, raced up the staircase, followed more slowly by hisfriend.Hammond never wholly forgot the picture of the sitting-room andits occupant, as he entered with Carlyon. The room was a large one,exquisitely furnished, and flooded with a warm, mellow light. A small butcheerful-looking wood fire burned upon the tiled hearth, the atmosphereof the room fragrant with a soft, subtle odour, as though the burningwood were scented. From a couch, as the two men entered, a girl rosebriskly, and faced them. She made a picture which Tom never forgot. Thewarm, mellow light that filled the room seemed to clothe her as she stoodto meet them. America was stamped upon her and her dress, upon thearrangement of her hair, upon the very droop of her figure. She was tall,fair, with that exquisite colouring and smoothness of complexion that isthe product of an unartificial, hygienic life.Her face could not be pronounced wholly beautiful, but it was a face thatwas full of life and charm, her eyes being especially arrestive.Awfully glad you came up, Madge! cried Carlyon. Ive run my quarrydown, and this is my own particular, Tom Hammond.He made a couple of mockingly-funny elaborate bows, saying: Miss MadgeFinisterre, of Duchess County, New York. Mr. Tom Hammond, ofoh, shadesof Cosmopolitanism!of everywhere, of London just at present.Tom bowedto the girl.She returned his salute, and then held forth her hand in afrank, pleasant way, as she laughingly said, I have heard so much ofTom Hammond during the last few days, that I guess you seem like an oldacquaintance.Tom shook hands with the maiden, and for a moment or two they chatted asfreely and merrily as though they were old acquaintances.The voice of Carlyon broke into their chat, asking: Wheres Nunkums,Madge?Before the girl could reply, the door opened and Sir Archibald enteredthe room.One glance into his face would have been sufficient to have told Tom thetype of man he had to deal with, even if he had not seen him before.A warm-hearted, unconventional, impulsive man, a perfect gentleman inappearance, but a merry, hail-fellow-well-met man in his dealings withhis fellows.With a bit of mock drama in the gesture, Madge Finisterre flourished herhand towards the newcomer, crying,Sir Archibald, George? Lo, he is here! She flashed a quick glance tothe piano as she added, If only I had known you were about to enter,uncle, I would have treated you to a few crashing bars of stage-lifeentree-music.Go away with your nonsense! laughed the old man.Nonsense, indeed! the girl laughed as merrily as the old man. Then,with a sudden, swift movement, she crossed to the piano, struck one sharpnote upon it, and whispered in well-feigned hoarseness, Slow music forthe three conspirators as they retire to plot the destruction of Londonspress, and the accumulation of untold millions by their own specialjournalistic production!Her fingers moved over the ivory keys, and low, weird, creepy musicfilled the room with its eerie notes.Sir Archibald and George Carlyon fell in with the girls mood, and creptdoorwards on tiptoe.Number three, hissed the girl.And Tom Hammond laughingly followed with the two other men.She is a treat, is Madge! laughed George Carlyon, as the three menpassed through the doorway and made for the study-like room of SirArchibald.CHAPTER II.THE COURIER.For two hours the three men held close conference together. At the endof that time all the preliminaries of the new venture were settled. TomHammond had explained his long-cherished views of what the ideal dailypaper should be. Sir Archibald was delighted with the scheme, and, inclosing with Hammond, gave him a perfectly free hand.You were on the point of saying something about a striking poster toannounce the coming paper, Mr. Hammond, said the old baronet.Yes, Tom replied; I think a great deal may be done by arrestingthe attention of the peoplethose in London especially. My idea fora poster is this: the name of the paper is to be The Courier. Verywell, let us have an immense sheet poster, first-class drawing, strikingbut harmonious colouring, and bold, arrestive title of the paper andannouncement of its issue. Following the title, I would have in theextreme left a massive sign-post, a prominent arm of the structurebearing the legend To-morrow. On the extreme right of the picture Iwould put another sign-post, the arm of which should bear the words TheDay After To-morrow. I would have a splendidly-drawn mounted courier,the horse galloping towards the right-hand post, having left To-morrowwell in the rear.The old baronet exclaimed, Rush the thing on! Flood the hoardings ofLondon, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiffall thelarge towns, and the smaller ones as well, if you can get hoardings bigenough. Dont study the expense, either in the get-up or in the issue ofthe picture. Dont let the pill-sellers or cocoa or mustard people beatus.The old man sprang to his feet and paced the floor, rubbing his hands,crying continually,Good! good! Well wake old England up. WellToddle into lunch, interrupted George Carlyon. Thats the thirdsummons weve had!Tom Hammond sat next to Madge at luncheon, and was charmed with her easy,unconventional manners. But his mind was too full of the new paper, ofthe great opportunity that had come to him so unexpectedly, to be aswholly absorbed with the charm of her personality as he might otherwisehave been.He did not linger over the luncheon table.There are one or two fellows, Sir Archibald, he explained, whom Ishould like to secure on my staff at once. I dont want to lose even anhour.As he bade Madge Finisterre good-bye, he expressed the hope that he mightsee her again soon, and the girl in reply allowed her eyes unconsciouslyto express more than her words.She is the most charming woman I ever met, he told himself, as hefollowed Sir Archibald into his room for the final word for which thebaronet had asked. George Carlyon had remained behind with Madge.It was about the first working expenses I wanted to speak to you, Mr.Hammond, the baronet began. They were seated in the baronets room.I will have fifty thousand poundsor shall we say a hundredthousand?deposited, at once, in your name atwhat bank?Any good bank you please, Sir Archibald, so long as the particularbranch is fairly central.Capital and Countieshow will that do? the baronet asked, adding, Ialways bank with them myself.That will do, sir.How about the Ludgate Hill branch, Mr. Hammond?Could not be better, sir.Settled, then, Mr. Hammond! There were a few more words exchangedbetween master and man, and then they parted.As Tom Hammond strode along the Embankment towards Waterloo Bridge, hisheart was the heart of a boy again.Is life worth living! he cried inwardly, answering his own questionwith the rapturous words: In this hour I know nothing else that earthcould give me to make life more joyous!People passing him saw his face radiant with a wondrous joy. Its rareto see peace, even, in faces in our great cities. It is rarer still tosee joys gleam. He allowed his glance to flash all around him, as hemurmured, I am glad, too, that I am in London. Who dare say that Londonis dull, or grim, or sordid? Who was it that wrote, No man curses thetown more heartily than I, but after travelling by mountains, plain,desert, forest, and on the deep sea, one comes back to London and findsit the most wonderful place of them all!Ah! It was Roger Pocock, I believe, wrote that sentiment. Roger Pocock,I looks towards yer, sir. Thems my senterments!He laughed low and gleefully at his own merry mood. Then as his eyes tookin the river, the moving panorama of the Embankment, and caught the throbof the mighty pulsing of life all about him, Le Galliennes lines came tohim, and, while he moved onward, he murmured:    London, whose loveliness is everywhere.    London so beautiful at morning light,    One half forgets how fair she is at night.    London as beautiful at set of sun    As though her beauty had just begun!    London, that mighty sob, that splendid tear,    That jewel hanging in the great worlds ear.    Ah! of your beauty change no single grace,    My London with your sad mysterious face.He moved forward in a strange rapture of spirit. He forgot evenbeautiful London; he was momentarily unconscious how he travelledor whither. He might have been blind or deaf for all that he now sawor heard. The drone of a blind beggars voice reading the Scriptures,however, presently had power to break his trance. He paused a momentbefore the man.This same Jesus, droned the blind mans voice, who is taken up fromyou into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go.Hammond dropped a sixpence into the beggars box, and moved away, thewonder of the words he had just heard read arresting all his previousthoughts of his glad success.Shall so come in like manner! he murmured. I wonder what it means?The next instant a womans pitiful voice filled his ear, crying:For the love of God, good sir, give me the price of a piece of bread.He turned sharply towards her. Her face was haggard and hunger-filled;her eyes were wells of despair. He slipped his finger and thumb into thefob of his coat. The first coin that came to his touch was a shilling. Hedropped it into the emaciated, outstretched palm.The wretched creature gazed at the coin, then at him. Her lips moved, butno words came from them. Her eyes filled with a rush of tears. He passedon. But the incident moved him strangely.If Christ, he mused, ever comes back to earth again, surely, surely Hewill deliver it from such want and misery as that!He paused and looked back at the woman. Her face was buried in her hands.Her form was shaking with sobs. Curiosity tempted him to go back.As he came abreast of her, a child, a girl about nine, barefooted andtired-looking, was saying to the woman, Whats the matter, missis?Wouldnt that swell giv yer nuffink wen yer arst im?Give me nothing? The woman glanced down at the child. Why, he iskinder than Gawd, fur he give me a shilling!At this Tom Hammond hurried away.Kinder than God! he murmured. Oh, God, that we should have it in ourpower to buy such happiness for so small a sum!Kinder than God he repeated to himself. He was now mounting the granitesteps to the bridge. Of course, one knows better; yet how difficult ofproof it would become, if one had to explain it to that poor soul, andto the thousands like her in this great city!For the first time since leaving Sir Archibald his own joy was forgotten.The awful problem of Londons destitution had supplanted Londons beautyin his thoughts.CHAPTER III.FLOTSAM.Only nine hours!Tom Hammond laughed amusedly at his own murmured thought. It seemedridiculous almost to try to believe that only nine hours before he hadbeen a discharged journalist, while now he was at the head of what heknew would be the greatest journalistic venture Londonyea, the worldhadever seen.He had just dined. He felt that he wanted some kind of movement, somedistraction, to relieve the tension. He was in that frame of mind whensome kind of adventure was necessary, although he did not tell himselfthis, being hardly conscious of his own need. He knew that the haunts ofhis fellowsclub, theatre, music-hallwould only serve to irritate him.Some instinct turned his feet riverwards.It was now a quarter past seven oclock. Night had fallen upon London.Tom Hammond crossed the great Holborn thoroughfare. The heavier trafficof Londons commercial life had almost ceased. The omnibuses going westwere filled with theatregoers, and other pleasure-seekers. Hansomsflitted swiftly either way, each holding a man and a woman in eveningdress.Having crossed the roadway, he paused for a moment at the corner ofChancery Lane, and let his eye take in all the scene. And again LeGallienne came to his mind, and he softly murmured:    Ah! London! London! our delight,    Great flower that opens but at night,    Great city of the midnight sun,    Whose day begins when day is done.    Lamp after lamp against the sky    Opens a sudden beaming eye,    Leaping alight on every hand,    The iron lilies of the Strand,    Like dragonflies the hansoms hover    With jewelled eyes to catch the lover;    The streets are full of lights and loves,    Soft gowns and flutter of soiled doves.He turned with a faint sigh, and began to pass on down Chancery Lane.Oh, London! he mused, thy surface may be wonderful and beautiful; butbelowwhat are you below the surface?    The human moths about the light    Dash and cling in dazed delight,    And burn and laugh, the world and wife,    For this is London, this is life!    Upon thy petals butterflies,    But at thy root, some say, there lies    A world of weeping, trodden things,    Poor worms that have not eyes or wings.He moved onwards in the direction of the Law Courts. Presently he nearedthe Waterloo Bridge approach. He had, all unrealized by himself, since heleft the restaurant where he had dined, been walking towards the river.A moment or two after, and he was leaning on the parapet of the bridge,looking down into the dark waters. Sluggish, oil-like in appearance, asseen in the dull gleam of the lamps, the river moved seawards. A suddenlonging to get out upon those dark waters came to him.If only he mused. Then, turning briskly, he came face to face with aman in a blue guernsey, who was crossing the bridge. It was the very manof his half-uttered thought. If only I could run up against Bob Carter!he had almost said.Good evening, Mister Hamnd. The man in the guernsey saluted with athick, tar-stained forefinger as he recognized Tom Hammond.Good evening, Carter. Hammond laughed as he added, I was just wishingI could meet you, for I felt I should like to get out on the river.Im jes going as fur as Lambeff, sir. Ef yer likes ter go wif me,youll do me proud, sir; yer know that, I knows!A few minutes later the two men sat in Carters boat. Hammond, in thestern, was steering. The man Carter, on the first thwart, manipulated theoars. Hammond had known the man about a year. He had done him a kindnessthat the waterman had never forgotten.Awd go to ther worlds end fur yer, sir, he had often said since.The man was ordinarily a silent companion, and to-night after a fewexchanged words between the pair, he was as silent as usual.Down the wide, turgid river the boat, propelled by Carters two oars,shot jerkily, the rise and fall of the glow in the rowers pipe-bowlsynchronizing with the lift and dip of the oars.Hammond enjoyed the silence. There was a weirdness about this nighttrip on the river that fitted in with his mood. His brain had beenconsiderably overwrought that day. The quiet row was beginning to soothethe overwrought nerves. Where he sat in the stern of the boat, hefaced the clock-tower at Westminster. The gleaming windows of the greatembankment hotels lay behind him. A myriad electric lights were on hisright hand. The gloom and darkness of the unlighted wharfage on theSurrey side were on his left.Only by a waterway miracle Carter cleared an anchored barge that, defyingthe laws of the river, carried no warning light.Drat em! growled the man Carter. They oughter do a stretch inPortlan or Dartmoor fur breakin the lor. Theres many a onest watermanwhose boats foun bottom-up, or smashed to smithereens, an whose bodysfoun, or isnt, jes, as the case may be, all becos they lazy houns istoo ide-boun to light a lamp, cuss em!His growl died away in his throat. The glowing fire of his pipe rose andfell quicker than ever, telling of a fierce anger burning within him.Ssh! he hissed. Hammond saw that his face was turned shorewards. Heheaved aft towards Hammond, and whispered, Kin yer see that woman, sir?He jerked his chin in the direction of a line of moored barges.Hammond had turned his head, and could plainly discern the form of awoman standing on the edge of the outer barge of the cluster.The men in the boat sat still, but watchful.Do she mean sooerside, sir? whispered Carter. Looks like it, sir.Dont make a soun.Even as he spoke the woman leaped into the air. There was a low scream, asplash, a leap of foam flashed dully for one instant, then all was stillagain.The waterman plied his oars furiously. Hammond steered for the spot wherethat foam had splashed. An instant later the boat was over the placewhere the body had disappeared. Carter lay on his oars, and peered intothe darkness on one side. Hammond strained his eye on the other side.With startling suddenness a hand darted upwards within a foot of whereHammond sat in the stern of the boat. In the same instant the womanshead appeared. Hammond reached out excitedly, and caught the back hairof the woman, twisting his fingers securely into the knot of hair at theback of her head.Carter shipped his oars, and in two minutes the wretched woman was safein the boat. Her drenched face gleamed white where they laid her. A lowwhimpering sob broke from her.Turn er over on her face a little, sir, while I makes the boat fast fura minute or two, sir, jerked out the waterman.Pore soul ov er! he went on, knotting his painter to a bolt in thestern of a barge. She ave took in a bellyful of Thames water, an itaint filtered no sort, thats sartin!Hammond had by this time turned the woman over on her face.Carter came aft bearing a water-beaker in his hands.Ill lift her legs, sir, he said, and you put this beaker under her,jes above her knees; thatll elp her a bit.That was done, and almost instantly the woman was very sick.In my locker there, sir, Ive got a drop o whisky. I keeps it there furmergencies like this, said Carter.Hammond moved to allow the man to reach a seat-locker in the stern. Thenext minute, while Hammond supported the woman, the waterman poured afew drops of the spirit down her throat.She coughed and sputtered, but the draught restored her. She began to cryin a low, whimpering way.We must get her ashore, Carter, cried Hammond. Ill take the oars,and, as you know the riverside better than I do, just steer into thenearest landing-place you know.Carter leaped to the bows, cast off the painter, and hurried aft again.Jes long yere, sir, theres an old landin asll jes serve us. Wotsyer fink ter do wi the pore soul, sirnot and her over to the perlice?No, neither the police nor workhouse, Carter. I wish I could see herface, and see what kind of woman she is.By way of reply, Carter struck a match, and lit a small bulls-eyelantern. When the wick had caught light, he flashed it on the face of thewoman.Her eyes were closed, her face was deadly pale. Her hair was dishevelled.But in the one flashing glance Hammond took at her, he recognized her.Its Mrs. Joyce! he muttered half-aloud and in amazed tones.Know er, sir? asked the waterman.A little! he replied. Her husband is a reportera drinking scamp.Carter shut off the light of the bulls-eye, at that moment.Were jes ere now, sur, sos best not to be callin tention like wia light.He steered the boat into a kind of narrow alley-way between two crazy oldwharves.       *       *       *       *       *Hammond, rightly gauging the kindly heart of his landlady, had broughtthe drenched woman in a cab to his lodgings. She was still in ahalf-fainting condition when he carried her into the house. In twosentences he explained the situation to the landlady, whose naturalkindness and loyalty to her lodger made her willing to aid his purpose ofrescue.I will carry her up to the bath-room, he said. Let your girl get a cupof milk heated as hot as can be sipped, while you bath this poor soulquickly in very hot water. Then let her be got to bed, and have somegood, nourishing soup ready. Shell probably sleep after that. And in themorningwell, the events of the morning will take their own shape.Half-an-hour later, as Hammond took a cup of coffee, he had thesatisfaction of knowing that the woman he had saved was in bed, and doingwell.Poor soul! he mused. That brute of a husband has probably driven herto this attempt on her life. I wonder what her history was before shemarried, for I remember how it struck me, that day when I saw her at theoffice, that she was evidently a woman of some culture.It was nearly ten now. He had no desire to go out again. It wanted twohours quite to his usual bed-time. But a strange sense of drowsinessbegan to steal over him, and he went off to his bed.What a day this has been! he muttered, as he laid his head on thepillow.CHAPTER IV.I ONLY REAPED WHAT I SOWED.Hammond awaited the woman whom he had saved from drowning.She has slept fairly well, the landlady told him, and I made her eat agood breakfast that I carried up to her myself, Mr. Hammond!Now he waited to speak to her. A moment or two more, and the landladyushered her into the room, then slipped away.How can I ever repay you, sir! cried the woman, seizing the hand thatHammond held out to her.For a moment or two her emotion was too great for further speech. Hammondled her to an armchair and seated her. She sobbed convulsively for amoment or two. He allowed her to sob. Presently tears came. The paroxysmpassed, the tears relieved her, and she lifted her sad, beautiful eyes tohis face.You knowoh, yes, you must know, Mr. Hammond(I recognized you lastnight)how I came to be in the water. I tried to take my life. I wasmiserable, despairing! God forgive me.His strong eyes were full of a rare tenderness, as he said, But, Mrs.Joyce, you surely know that death is not the end of all existence. I amnot what would be called a religious man, but every fibre of my inwardbeing tells me that death does not end all.He saw a shiver pass over her, as she hoarsely replied, I, too, realizethat this morning, Mr. Hammond. But last night the madness of anoverwhelming despair was upon me. My life had been a literal hell foryears, until yesterday I could bear it no longer. I was famished withhunger, sick with despair, andShe sighed wearily. Perhaps, she went on, if you knew all I haveborne, you would not wonder at my rash, mad act.Tell me your story, Mrs. Joyce, he said, gently. It may relieve yourovercharged heart, and, anyhow, I will be your friend, as far as I can.She sighed again. This time there was a note of relief, rather thanweariness, in the sigh.My father was a well-to-do farmer, she began, in North Hants. I wasthe only child, and I fear I was spoiled. I received the best educationpossible, and loved my studies for their own sake, for culture, in allits forms, had a strong attraction for me. I had been engaged to a youngyeoman farmer for nearly a year. I had known him all my life, and we hadbeen sweethearts even as children. Then there came suddenly into my lifethat man Joyce, for whom I sacrificed everything. God only knows how hecontrived to exercise such an awful fascination over me as to make meleave everyone, everything, and marry him.For a moment she paused, and shuddered. Her voice, when she spoke, again,was hollow, and full of tears.I killed my father by eloping on the very eve of my arranged marriagewith Ronald Ferris. Ronald left the country as soon as he could wind uphis affairs. And Iwell, here in this mighty Babylon, I have ever sincebeen reaping some of the sorrow I had sown. Not a penny of my fathersmoney ever reached me, and that brute Joyce only married me for what heexpected to get with me. He has done his best to make earth a hell forme, and I, in my mad blindness, last night, almost exchanged earthsfleeting hell for Gods eternal hell.A look of shame filled her eyes as she lifted them to Hammond.What you reminded me of just now, Mr. Hammond, I, deep down in my soul,know only too wellthat death does not end all. My father was a trueChristian, and a lay preacher. I have travelled with him hundreds oftimes to his preaching appointments, playing the harmonium and singingsolos for him in his services. More than once the sense of Gods claimupon me was so great as almost to compel my yielding my heart and life.Would to God I had! But my pride, my ambitions, strangled my gooddesires, and, as I said just now, I broke my fathers heart. I killedhim, and ruined all my own life, though I have no pity for myself. ThenLondon life, my husbands brutality, my own misery, all helped to driveeven the memory of God from my mind.Yet, broke in Hammond, the Christian religion teaches that sorrow andsuffering ought to drive the possessor of the faith nearer to God.There was a hint of apology in his tones as he went on:Dont misunderstand me, Mrs. Joyce; I only speak from hearsay. I haveheard parsons preach it, but I know nothing experimentally about thesethings myself.She smiled in a slow, sad way, and, catching her breath in a kind ofquick sob, said: Neither have I ever known anything experimentally ofthese truths. I drifted into the outward form of a correct, religious,life. I learned to like the brightness of our chapel services, the fun ofchoir practice, the merry company, the adulation heaped upon me for mysolo-singing. Then there were the tea-meetings, the service of song, anda multitude of other mild excitements which went to brighten the monotonyof a rural existence. But of God, of Christ, of the Divine life, I fear Iknew nothing.Hammond smiled inwardly as he listened to this strange confession. Thephraseology was new to him.It is the shibboleth of Nonconformity, I suppose, he told himself. AndI suppose each section of religious society has its own outward form ofthings in which it trusts, thinking, caring, nothing for the great Divineverities that should be the true religious life.He did not utter his thoughts aloud, but asked with some apparentirrelevance, Where is your husband, Mrs. Joyce?Off on one of his drinking bouts, or maybe, locked up for drunkenness; Icannot say.Her lifted eyes were full of beseeching, as she went on, You will keepsecret, Mr. Hammond, all this wild, mad episode of my life. If only Icould know that the sad, mad, bad story was locked up between God andyou, your kind landlady and myself, I think I could go back and face mymisery better.Do not fear, Mrs. Joyce, he replied quickly. The affair shall be asthough it had never been. I can answer for Mrs. Belcher, my landlady; andfor myself I give you my word, andGod reward you, sir! she sobbed. Already you have given me clearerviews of Him than any minister or any sermon ever did.A few moments later Mrs. Joyce rose to leave. He pressed three sovereignsinto her hand, and in spite of her tearful protestations made her takethe money.If you are ever in desperate need, come to me, or write me, Mrs. Joyce,and I will help you, if I can. Meanwhile, be assured that the little Ihave done for you I would have done for any stranger, for, after all, thehuman race is linked by a strange, a mighty family tie. Good-bye.She wrung the hand he gave her, then with a sudden, impulsive movementshe lifted it sharply to her lips and kissed it with a tearfulpassionateness.The next moment she was gone. His hand was wet with her tears.Poor soul! he muttered.Passing across the room to the window, he glanced out. She was movingdown the street. Her handkerchief was pressed to her eyes.How strange, he murmured, as he turned from the window, arethese chance encounters in life! Like ships at sea, we sight, hail,exchange some kind of greeting, then pass on. Do we, after all, Iwonder, unconsciously influence each other in these apparently triviallife-encounters? If so, how? Take this episode now, for instance. Will myencounter with that poor soul have any effect on my life, or on hers? Ifso, what?CHAPTER V.LILY WORK.The room we now enter is a large one. It is close under the roof of ahouse in Finsbury. The man there at work pauses for a moment.The room is a workshop. The man is a Jewbut what a Jew! He might haveposed to an artist as a model, a type of the proudest Jewish monarch overIsrael. Face, form, staturenot even Saul or David or Solomon could haveexcelled him.The room held the finished workmanship of his hands for the three pastyears. And now, as he paused in his laboura labour of lovefor a moment,and drew his tall form erect, and lifted his face to the window abovehim, a light that was almost holy filled his eyes.God of our fathers, he murmured, God of the Holy Tent and of theTemple, instruct me; teach my fingers to do this great work.He let his hands fall with an almost sacred touch upon the chapiter hehad been chasing. He wist not that his face shone with an unearthlylight, as for a moment his lips moved in prayer. Then quietly reaching athick old book from a shelf, he opened it at one of its earlier pages,and read aloud.And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by nameBezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and Ihave filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunningworks, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cuttingof stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all kindsof workmanship. And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the sonof Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that arewise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I havecommanded thee: the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of thetestimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture ofthe tabernacle.The lightit was now almost a firedeepened in his eyes. A rare, a rich,cadence filled his voice as he read the holy words. His fingers moved tothe middle of the book. It easily opened at a certain place, as though ithad been often used at that page. Again he read aloud:And the chapiters that were upon, the top of the pillars were of lilywork, ... and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates alsoabove, ... and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round aboutupon the other chapiter, ... and he set up the pillars in the porch ofthe temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereofJachin (He shall establish); and he set up the left pillar, and calledthe name thereof Boaz (In it is strength). And on the top of thepillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.With a reverent touch the man closed the book, replaced it on the shelf,then, lifting his eyes again to where the cold, clear light streamed downthrough the great skylight in the ceiling, he murmured:How long, O Lord, shall Thy people be cast off and trodden down, andtheir land, Thy land, be held by the accursed races?For a moment a look of pain swept into his face. Then, as he becameconscious of the touch of his lowered hand upon the chapiter, his eyestravelled downwards to the exquisite lily work, and the light of a newhope swept the pain off his face.The very fact that the time has come, he murmured, for us to bepreparing for the next temple, is a token from Jehovah that the day ofMessiah draweth nigh.His eyes lingered a moment on the rare and beautiful workmanship, thenhe took up a chasing tool and continued his toil; yet, while he workedhe kept up a running recitative of Ezekiels description of the greattemplefor he knew by heart all the chapters of that prophet.As he presently repeated the words: And the Prince in the midst of them,when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth, helifted his eyes with a deep holy rapture shining in all his face.He closed his recitative with a ringing note of triumph in his voice, ashe cried, It shall be round about eighteen thousand cubits: and the nameof the city from that day shall be Jehovah-ChammahThe Lord is there.There was a moment of absolute silence. The graver was still, the handthat held it might have been stone, so rigid did it become. The lips ofAbraham Cohen moved, but no other sound came from him save the wordsJehovah was there, and he prayed aloud.In the midst of his rapt devotion the door of the workroom opened. Theslight sound aroused the dreamer. He turned his face in the direction ofthe door, and his eyes flashed with pleasure.Ah, Zillah! he cried in greeting. The girl he addressed closed thedoor, thus shutting out the odour of frying fish. She crossed the floorquickly, with a certain eagerness, and came towards him with a raregrace. She was singularly beautiful, of an Eastern style of beauty. Hercomplexion was of the Spanish olive tone, and her melting eyes were ofthat same Spanish type. Her haira wondrous crown of itwas blue-black.She had a certain plumpness of form that seemed to add rather than takefrom her general beauty. She was sister to his wife.Supper will be ready in five minutes, Abraham, she began. Will you beready for it?He smiled down into her great black eyes. He was never very keen on hismeals. He ate to live only; he did not live to eat. She knew that, andhad long since learned that his labour of love was as meat and drink tohim. Her eyes glided past him and rested on his work.It is very beautiful, Abraham! she cried. There was reverence as wellas rapture and admiration in her voice and glance.It cannot be too beautiful, Zillah, he returned.Her eyes were on his work. His were on her face. He read in it therapturous admiration of his workmanship.When will the Messiah come? she sighed.Soon, I believe! he returned. Jehovah rested in His creative workafter six days labour. A thousand years with Him are as one day. May itnot well be, then, that as there have passed nearly six thousand years(each thousand years, representing one day) that He will presently restin His finished work for His people, through the coming of the Messiah,as He did at the creation?He laid his tool aside, and turned to the beautiful girl, as he continued:Besides, do not our sacred books say that when three springs have beendiscovered on Mount Zion, Messiah will come? Two springs have latelybeen discovered by the excavators in Jerusalem, and our people out thereexcitedly watch the work of these men, expecting soon the discovery ofthe third spring.Her eager, parted lips told how she hung upon his speech. He smiled downgratefully into her great black lustrous eyes, though a sigh escaped himas he said:Ah! I wish Leah would only show a little of the interest in all this,that you do, Zillah!You must not blame Leah too much, Abraham, the girl answered quickly.She has her children, you know. Mother always said that if ever Leah hadbabies, that there would be nothing else in the world for her except thebabies. Besides, Abraham, no two of us are constituted alike, and Leah iswhat the Gentiles about here call happy-go-lucky. But, Abraham, tell memore of what you think of Messiahs coming. Leahs five minutes will besure to run to a quarter of an hour.I do think Messiah is coming soon, cried the young fellow excitedly.Who knows? Perhaps when the Passover comes again, and we set His chair,and open the door for Him to enter, that He will suddenly come. Did Itell you, Zillah, about the date discovery at Safed, in Palestine?No, what is it? The girls face glowed with a strange earnestness, hervoice rang with it.Safed, he went on, quickly, is a little town to the north-west ofGalilee. Our Rabbi there has discovered from our sacred books, thatMessiahs coming, and the overthrow of our enemies, will be in theyear five thousand six hundred and sixty-sixnineteen hundred and sixaccording to the Gentile reckoning. Our Father Moses, and all thechildren of Israel sang, when Jehovah delivered them from the RedSea:Yea, by the force of Thy swelling waves hast Thou demolished thosewho arose against Thee. Thou didst discharge Thy wrath, it devouredthem up like stubble. Our Rabbisand even the Christian Gentileteachersagree that the deliverance of our race from Pharaoh, and thedestruction of his hosts, picture our races future as well as its past.And the numerical value of Thou shalt overthrow (part of those twosong-stanzas I have just repeated) gives the date I have mentioned as thetime of our deliverance from all our troubles, when Messiah shall come.There was a sudden clatter of little feet outside at that moment, and aboy and a girl burst into the room.What do you think, father? cried the boy, with the excitedimpulsiveness of a child bursting with news. A boyhes a Gentile, ofcoursewhom I know says that Messiah has come, that the cursed Nazarenewas He, and thatWe will go to supper, Reuben, and you and I will talk about that anothertime. Cohen spoke quietly to his boy. He had his own reasons forchecking the subject at that time.His aunt caught the boys hand, and danced with him out of the room.Rachel, the little girl, a wondrous miniature of Zillah, clung to herfather, and the whole family trooped off to wash their hands before themeal.CHAPTER VI.AN INTERESTING TALK.The Courier was now an established fact. As a newspaper it was as mucha revelation to the journalists as to the general public. London hadtaken to it from the first moment of its issue. The provinces, insteadof following their usual course of waiting to see what London did, tooktheir own initiative, and adopted the new paper at once. Every instinctabout the ideal paper, felt and nursed during the waiting years by TomHammond, had been true instinct. He had always felt them to be true; nowhe realized the fact. He was a proud man, a happy man.One curious feature of the new journal had attracted much attention,even before the publication of the first issue. In his Foreword, as hehad termed it, in a full page announcement that appeared in three of theleading London dailies, Tom Hammond had said:An important feature of the Courier will be the item or items (as thecase may be) which will be found each day under the heading, From theProphets Chamber. A greater man than the editor of The Courier oncesaid, Every editor of a newspaper ought to have a strain of the seer inhis composition. He ought to have the gift of prophecy up to a certainpoint. He ought to be so thoroughly conversant with the history of hisown and every other nation that when history is on the point of repeatingitselfas it has a habit of doing,he may not be caught altogethernapping. It is the unexpected that happens, we say.True, but there are many of the so-called happenings of the unexpectedthat to the spirit of the seer will have been expected and more thanhalf-prophesied.Now, while we propose that the whole tone of The Courier shall showthe spirit of the seer in a measure, we shall endeavour to make theparticular column to which we are now alluding essentially new. In itwe shall deal with every class of subject likely to prove mentallyarrestive to our readers, and shall make it prophetic up to the limitsof our capacities as man, citizen and editor. How far the possession ofthe quality of the seer will be found in us we must leave the futureandour readersto decide. But we certainly anticipate that The ProphetsChamber column will be one of the most popular features of what we shallaim to make the most popular paper of the day.Tom Hammond was no believer in luck. He had left nothing to chance in theproduction of his paper. There was not a department left to subordinateswhich he did not personally assure himself was being carried out on thebest, the safest, lines. For weeks he literally lived on the spot wherehis great paper was to be produced, taking his meals and sleeping at anhotel close by the huge building that housed The Courier.He saw very little of Sir Archibald Carlyon during these weeks, andnothing at all of George, or the fair American, Madge Finisterre. Georgewas in Scotland; Madge on the Continent.His thoughts often turned to the American girl, and his eye brightenedand his pulse quickened whenever he heard of her from Sir Archibald.Once he had been permitted by Sir Archibald to read a gossipy letter sentby her to the old baronet. He laughed over a quotation in that letter.I am not like the Chicago girl, she wrote, of whom our Will Carletonwrites, who, telling all about her tour in Urop, says,    Old Scotland? Yes, all in our power,      We did there to be through;    We stopped in Glasgow one whole hour,      Then straight to Edinborough.    At Abbotsford we made a stay      Of half-an-hour precisely.    (The ruins all along the way      Were ruined very nicely.)    We did a mountain in the rain,      And left the others undone,    Then took the Flying Scotchman train,      And came by night to London.    Long tunnels somewhere on the line      Made sound and darkness deeper;    No; English scenery is not fine      Viewed from a Pullman sleeper.    Oh, Paris! Paris! Paris! Tis      No wonder, dear, that you go    So far into ecstasies      About that Victor Hugo!    He paints the city, high and low,      With faithful pen and ready.    (I think, my dear, I ought to know,      We drove there two hours steady.)I feel, Madge had written, that one wants a life-time to do theContinent.Tom Hammonds thoughts often flew to the gay girl. This morning, havingseen a review of Carletons latest book of ballads, he had been remindedof her, and he laid down his pen a moment, as he gave himself up to alittle reverie about her. An announcement aroused him.Miss Finisterre and Mr. Carlyon, sir.He smiled to himself. Talk of angels, etc., he mused.The next moment he was greeting his callers. Madge Finisterre looked, inTom Hammonds eyes, more radiant now than ever.Fancy, Mr. Hammond, she laughed, when the greetings were over, Georgeand I met at Dover! He had come south to see a friend off from Dover, andwas on the pier when I landed from the Calais boat. Weve been down tothat dear old country house, but I wanted to do some shopping, and to seehow you looked as editor-in-chief and general boss of the biggest dailypaper in the world.Tom Hammonds eyes flashed with a pleased light at her confession, whichimplied that she had thought of him, even as he had thought of her. Henoted, too, how an extra shade of colour warmed the clear skin of hercheeks as she made her confession.Because, she went on, all the world declares that The Courier is thepremier paper of the world, and everyone who is anyonein the know ofthings, I meanknows that Mr. Tom Hammond is The Courier.The talk, for a few minutes, was shop.You dont go in for a column of comic, Madge presently said. If youdid, I could give you an item, we, George and I, heard in the train as weran up to town. There were two of your English parsons in our carriage,talking in that high-faluting note that always reminds me of yourhigh-pitched church service,dearly-beloved-brethren note.Well, the two parsons were telling yarns one against theotherchestnuts were cheap, I assure you,and one of them told a storyhe tacked on to General Booththe last time I heard it, it was told ofSpurgeon. He said that the General was going down Whitechapel, and,seeing the people pouring into a show, and wondering what there was sopowerfully attractive to the masses in these shows, he determined to gointo this particular one. It was advertised as a Museum of BiblicalCuriosities. Just as he got in, the showman was exhibiting a very rustyold sword, and saying,Now, yeres a werry hinterestin hobject. This is the sword wot Balaamit is hass wiv, cos ee wouldnt go. Booth speaks up, and says,Hold hard there, my friend; youre getting a little mixed. Balaamhadnt got a sword. He said, Would that I had a sword.Thats all right, guvnor, cried the showman; this is the sword eewished ee ad.The girls mimicry of the coster-showmans speech was inimitable, and thetwo men laughed as much at her telling as at the tale itself.George Carlyon got up from his seat, saying, But I say, you two, do youmind if I leave you to amuse each other for an hour? I want, very much,to run down to the club. Ill come back for you, Madge, or meet yousomewhere.Bless the boy! she laughed. Do you think I was reared in an incubator,or in your Mayfair? Havent you learned that, given a Yankee girls gotdollars under her boots to wheel on, it aint much fuss for her to skatethrough this old country of yours, nor yet through Europe, come to that,even though she has no more languages under her tongue than good plainDuchess county American. I told the boys that before I left home.George Carlyon laughed, as, accepting his release, he nodded to the pairand left the room.It was a strangely new experience to Tom Hammond, to be left alone with abeautiful and charming woman like Madge Finisterre.The picture she made, as she moved round the room looking at the framedpaintings, all gifts from his artist friends, came to him as a kind ofrevelation. When he had met her that day in the Embankment hotel, hehad been charmed with her beauty and her frank, open, unconventionalityof manner. He had thought of her many times sinceonly that very day, amoment before her arrival,thought of her as men think of a picture or apoem which has given them delight. But now he found her appealing to him.She was a woman, a beautiful, attractive woman. She suggested suddenthoughts of how a woman, loved, and returning that love, might affect hislife, his happiness.Her physical grace and beauty, the exquisite fit of her costume, theperfect harmony of itall this struck him now. But the woman in herappealed strongest to him.Awfully good, this sketch of street arabs! she turned to say, as shestood before a clever bit of black-and-white drawing.An end of a lace scarf she was wearing caught in a nail in the wall. Hesprang forward to release the scarf. It was not readily done, for hisfingers became infected with a strange nervousness. Once their hands met,their fingers almost interlocked. A curious little thrill went throughhim. He lifted his eyes involuntarily, and met her glance. A warm colourshot swiftly into her face. And he was conscious at the same moment thathis own cheeks burned.I guess Ill sit down before I do any more mischief, she laughed.Woman-like, she was quicker to get at ease than he was.Do you know, Mr. Hammond, she went on, as she seated herself in arevolving armchair, I just wanted very much to see how you were fixed uphere, and how you looked now that you are a big man.He made a deprecatory little gesture.Oh, but you are a really great man, she went on. I have heard some bigpeople talk of you, and sayShe leaned back, and smiled merrily at him, as she went on,Well, I guess if theres only a shadow of truth in the old saying, thenyour ears must often have burned.Madge Finisterre gave the chair in which she was sitting a half twist.Why dont you British people go in for rockers? she asked. I simplycant enjoy your English homes to the full, for want of a good rocker,wherever I go.An indiarubber bulb lay close to his hand. He pressed it without hernoting the movement. A clerk suddenly appeared. Hammond looked across atMadge, with an Excuse me, Miss Finisterre, one moment.He drew a sheet of notepaper towards him. The paper was headed with TheCourier title and address.Send me, at once, unpacked and ready for immediate use, the bestAmerican drawing-room rocking-chair you have in stock. Send invoice, cashwill follow, etc.That was what he wrote. He enclosed it in an envelope, then on a separateslip of paper he wrote:Take a cab, there and back, to Walliss, Holborn Circus. See how smartyou can be; bring the chair, ordered, back with you.From his purse he took a four-shilling piece, and gave the young fellowthe note, the slip of instructions, and the coin.As the attendant left the room, he turned again to Madge, who, utterlyunsuspicious of the errand on which he had sent his employee, was amusingherself with a copy of Punch. She looked up from the paper as the doorclosed.I like The Courier immensely, Mr. Hammond, she cried. There was arare warmth of admiration in her tone.Thank you, Miss Finisterre! His eyes said more than his words, what doyou specially like in it? he asked; or is your liking of a more generalcharacter?I do like it from a general standpoint, she replied; I think it thebest paper in the world. But especially do I like your own particularcolumn, From a Prophets Chamber. But, Mr. Hammond, about the Jewyouare going in strong for him, arent you?From the ordinary newspaper point, yes, he said. I cannot quiterecall how my mind was first switched on to the subject, but I do knowthisthat the more I study the past history of the race, and the futurepredictions concerning it, the more amazed I am, how, past, present, andfuture, the Jews, as a nation, are interwoven with everything political,musical, artisticeverything, in fact. And I wonder, equally, that wejournalists, as a wholeI speak, of course, as far as I know my kinsmenin lettersshould have thought and written so little about them.Take their ubiquitousness, Miss Finisterre, went on Hammond. Theredoes not appear to have been an empire in the past that has not had itscolony of Jews. By which I do not mean a Ghetto, simply, a herding ofsordid-living, illiterate Hebrews, but a study colony of men and women,who, by sheer force of intellect, of brain power, have obtained andmaintained the highest positions, the greatest influence.Why, in China, even, isolated, conservative China, before Christ wasborn in Bethlehem, the Jews were a prosperous, ubiquitous people,worshipping the one God, Jehovah, amidst all the foulness of Chineseidolatries.Madge Finisterre listened with rapt interest. The man before her, firedwith his subject, talked marvellously. A good listener helps to make agood talker, and Tom Hammond talked well.It is not simply that they practically hold the wealth of the world intheir hands, that they are the worlds bankers, but they are dominatingour press, our politics.With glowing picture of words he poured out a flood of wondrous fact andillustration, winding up presently with:Then you cannot kill the Jew, you cannot wipe him out. Persecution hashad the effect of stunting his growth, so that the average Britisher isseveral inches taller than the average Jew. But the life of the Hebrewis indestructible. Sometimes of late I have asked myself this question,as I have reviewed the history of the dealings of so-called Christianitywith the Semitic raceHas Christianity been afraid of the Jews, or whyhas she sought to stamp them out?The pair had been so engrossed with their talk that they had lost allcount of time. A half-hour had slipped by since Tom Hammond had sent hismessenger to Walliss. The young fellow suddenly appeared at the door.Got it, Charlie?Without waiting for a reply to his question, the editor bounded from hisseat and passed outside. Thirty seconds later the door opened again, andhe appeared, bearing a splendid rocker in his arms.Before she fully realized the wonder of the whole thing, Madge foundherself seated in the rocking-chair. Swaying backwards and forwards, andblushing and smiling, she cried:You are a wonderful man, Mr. Hammond!You said you could never fully enjoy our English houses for want of arocker. Now, however angelic your visits to this room may be, you shallhave one inducement to slip ina rocker.She was beginning her thanks again, when he interrupted with:But, excuse me, Miss Finisterre, what about some tea? Shall we go outand get some, or would you prefer that I should order it in here?Oh, here, by all means! I can have tea at a restaurant every day ofmy life, but with a real London liona real live editorand in his ownspecial den. Why, it may never fall to my lot again. Oh, here, by allmeans! she cried, excitedly.He squeezed that rubber bulb again. To the lad Charlie, who appeared, hegave a written order to a neighbouring restaurant. Twenty minutes laterthe tea was in the room.Madge officiated with the teapot. Hammond watched her every movement.A truly pretty, graceful girl never looks handsomer to a man than whenpresiding at a tea-table. Tom Hammond thought Madge had never looked morecharming. The meal was a very enjoyable one, and as she poured out hissecond cup he paid her a pretty compliment, adding:To see you thus, Miss Finisterre, makes one think what fools men are nottoHe paused abruptly. She flashed a quick glance of enquiry at him.Not to what, Mr. Hammond?I wonder, he replied, if I ought to say what I left unsaid?Why not? she asked.I dont know why I should not, he laughed. I was going to say that, tohave a bright, beautiful, graceful woman like Madge Finisterre pouringout tea for him, makes a man think what a fool he is not to marry.His tone and glance were alike full of meaning. She could not mistakehim. Her colour heightened visibly. Her eyes drooped before his ardentgaze. The situation became tense and full of portent.The opening of the door at that instant changed everything. GeorgeCarlyon had returned. At the same moment a wire was brought to Hammond,together with a sheaf of lettersthe afternoon mail.CHAPTER VII.COMING.George Carlyons entrance, the arrival of the afternoon mail, and thetelegram gave Madge Finisterre an opportunity to escape. George Carlyonwas anxious to leave, and Madge rose at once to accompany him.Tom Hammond did not press them to stay, for he, too, felt awkward. Thefriends shook hands. The eyes of Madge and Hammond met for one instant.Each face flushed under the power of the others glance.When the door had closed upon them, Tom went back to his old place by thetable, his eyes involuntarily sweeping the whole apartment. He smiled ashe suddenly realized how empty the room now seemed. His glance restedupon the tea-tray, and he rang for the lad Charlie.Clear all this away, Charlie, please, he began. Then with a smile hesaid, You will find a capital cup of tea in that pot.The boy grinned. At his first glance at the tray he had mentally decidedthat he would be able to have a rare feast. A couple of minutes, and theboy had gone.Tom Hammond gathered up his mail, and was about to drop into his ordinaryseat, when he remembered the rocker. With a smile at Madges occupancy ofthe chair, he dropped into it.For fully five minutes he sat still thinking, reviewing all thecircumstances of the peculiar situation upon which the unexpected comingof George Carlyon had broken. He asked himself whether he was really inlove with the fair Madge, and whether he would have proposed to her ifher cousin had not so unexpectedly turned up? He made no definite replyto his own questioning, but turned to his mail.The telegram he had opened at once on its receipt. He turned now to theletters. He had opened all but two. The last one was addressed in awomans hand-writing. Breaking the envelope, he took out the letter, andturned first to the signature on the fourth page.Millicent Joyce, he read. Millicent Joyce? he repeated. Unconsciouslyhe had laid his emphasis on the Millicent, and he forgot the Joyce.But suddenly it came to him that the letter was from Mrs. Joyce, thewoman whom he had helped to save from drowning on the night of thatmemorable day when the great chance of his life had come to him.Poor soul! he muttered. I wonder what she has written about? The nextinstant he was reading the letter.Tom Hammond cast his eyes over the letter which Mrs. Joyce had sent him,and which ran thus:    Dear Sir,    I gave you my word that if ever I was in special trouble or    need I would write, or come to you for help.    I did not promise you, however, that if any great joy or    blessing should come to me, that I would let you know. I dont    think I believed any joy could ever possibly come into my life    again. But joy and wondrous gladness have come into my life,    and in an altogether unexpected way.    You will remember how I said to you in parting, that morning,    that your strong, cheery words had given me a clearer view of    God than any sermon I had ever listened to. That impression    deepened rather than diminished when I got home. My husband,    I heard, had been sent to Wandsworth Prison for a month, for    assaulting the police when drunk.    And in this month of quiet from his brutalities, the great joy    of my life came to me. I began to attend religious services    from the very first night after my return home. I went to    church, chapel, mission hall, and Salvation Army.    One night I went to the hall of the Mission for Railway Men. A    lady was speaking that night, and God found me, and saved me.    All that I had ever heard from my dear fathers lips, when he    preached about conversion, came back to me, and that night I    passed from death to life.    The subject of the address was The Coming of the Lord. I    listened in amazement as the lady speaker declared that, for    this age, God evidently meant that this truth of the near    coming of Christ should have almost, if not quite, the most    prominent place in all public preaching.    I was startled to hear her say that there were nearly three    hundred direct references to the second coming of Christ in the    Gospels and Epistles, and that there were thus more than double    the number of references to that subject than even to that of    salvation through the blood of the Atonement.    With her Bible in her hand, she turned readily to a score of    passages as illustrations of her statement, and all through her    address she never made a statement without backing it up by    Scripture. One thing she said laid a tremendous grip upon me,    and led me to an immediate decision for Christ: she said, How    often is the possibility of sudden death advanced by a preacher    as an incentive to unsaved souls to yield to God!    But how poor an argument is that compared with the near    approach of Christ! Sudden death might come to one person in    a congregation before twenty-four hours, but in a sense, that    would touch that one person only. But if Christ came to take up    His people from the earththe dead in Christ from their graves,    the living from their occupations, etc.,this would affect    every unsaved soul in every part of the country, of the world,    even.Tom Hammond paused in his reading.What on earth can she mean? he murmured, under his breath. Then he wenton from the letter:    I gave myself up to God there and then, Mr. Hammond, and am    seeking now to live so that, should Christ come, even before I    finish this letter, I may be ready to be caught up to meet Him    in the air.Hammond paused again.What can the woman mean? he murmured again. With the letter held inhis hand, his eyes became fixed upon space, his mind was searching forsomething that he had recently heard or read bearing on this strangetopic. The clue seemed almost within grasp, yet for awhile he could notrecall it.Suddenly it came to him. A volume of poems had been sent to him forreview, amid the excitement of the second days issue of The Courier.He had glanced rapidly through the book, had written a brief line for hispaper, acknowledging the receipt of the book, and promising to refer toit fully at some later date.That book, he mused, had something in it aboutaboutHe got up from the rocker, took his place at his table, then wheeledabout slowly in his revolving chair, and began searching his book-case.In an instant his keen eye picked out the volume he sought. He wheeledround again to his table, the book in his hand.He turned a moment to the title-page. Ezekiel and Other Poems, he read.By B. M.B. M., he mused, Whom have I heard writes under those initials? Ah! Iremember! Mrs. Miller.Barbara Miller.He ran the gilt-edged leaves rapidly through his practised fingers, hisquick eye catching enough of the running pages to satisfy him. Suddenlyhe paused in his search. His eye had lit upon what he sought, and hebegan to read:                               COMING.    At even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the    morning.    It may be in the evening,      When the work of the day is done,    And you have time to sit in the twilight      And watch the sinking sun,    While the long, bright day dies slowly      Over the sea,    And the hour grows quiet and holy      With thoughts of Me;    While you hear the village children      Passing along the street,    Among those thronging footsteps      May come the sound of My feet.    Therefore I tell you, Watch,      By the light of the evening star,    When the room is growing dusky      As the clouds afar;    Let the door be on the latch      In your home,    For it may be through the gloaming      I will come.He paused in his reading for a moment, for, like a voice near by, thedrone of that blind beggars reading came to him, as he had heard it thatday on the embankment.This same Jesus shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go.I remember, he mused, how that sentence arrested me. My mind wasutterly pre-occupied a moment before, but that wondrous sentence piercedmy pre-occupation.His eyes dropped to the poem again, and he read on:    It may be when midnight      Is heavy on the land,    And the black waves lying dumbly      Along the sand;    When the moonless night draws close,    And the lights are out in the house;    When the fires burn low and red,    And the watch is ticking loudly      Beside the bed.    Though you sleep, tired out, on your couch,    Still your heart must wake and watch    In the dark room;    For it may be that at midnight      I will come.He read rapidly, but more eagerly interested each moment. The nextsection he scarcely paused upon, but the fourth he lingered over, andthen read it the second time:    It may be in the morning,      When the sun is bright and strong,    And the dew is glittering sharply      Over the little lawn;    When the waves are laughing loudly      Along the shore,    And the little birds sing sweetly      About the door;    With the long days work before you,      You rise up with the sun,    And the neighbours come in to talk a little      Of all that must be done:    But remember that I may be the next      To come in at the door,    To call you from your busy work      For evermore.    As you work, your heart must watch,    For the door is on the latch      In your room,    And it may be in the morning      I will come.He read on with a strange, breathless interest the next two pages ofpoem, then, with a sudden sense of hush upon him, he went carefully overthe concluding lines:    So I am watching quietly      Every day.    Whenever the sun shines brightly,      I rise and say,    Surely it is the shining of His face!    And look unto the gates of His high place      Beyond the sea,    For I know He is coming shortly      To summon me.    And when a shadow falls across the window      Of my room,    Where I am working my appointed task,    I lift my head to watch the door, and ask      If He is come;    And the angel answers sweetly      In my home:    Only a few more shadows,      And He will come.The face of Tom Hammond, as he laid down the book, was full of a strange,new perplexity. Strange, very! he muttered. Do you know Joyce, Mr.Simpson? Hammond asked a reporter. He used to be on the staff of theDaily Tatler, cried the man. Knew him well years ago, sir. Oldschool-fellows, in fact. Got wrong with the drink, sir. Gone to thedogs, andHave you seen or heard anything of him this last month, Mr. Simpson?Yes, sir. Hes grown worse than ever. Magistrate at Bow Street,committing him for three days, said fellow ought to be put in Broadmoor.Pity his poor wife, sir. Perfect lady, sir.You know Mrs. Joyce, then? Hammond queried.The reporter sighed, Rather, sir! Wished a thousand times I could havehad her for a wife, and hed had mine. I should have had a happier life.And heThe man laughed grimly. Well, hed have had a tartar!Hammond had heard something about the shrewish wife Simpson hadunfortunately married. But he had learned all he wanted to know, sodismissed the poor, ill-married fellow.I think I must call upon Mrs. Joyce, and learn more about this strangematter of the coming Christ, he told himself.He copied the address from the head of the letter into his pocket-book,then turned to the last letter of his mail.This proved to be a comparatively short letter, but, to Hammond, adeeply-interesting one. It was signed Abraham Cohen, and the writerexplained that he was a Jew, who had taken the Courier from the veryfirst number, and had not only become profoundly interested in the recentutterances of the editor in the Prophets Chamber column, but he had,for some days, been impressed with the desire to write to the Prophet.    Will you pardon me, sir, the letter went on, if I say that    it would be to your immense advantage, now that your mind has    become aroused to the facts and history of our race, if you    would get in touch with some really well-read, intelligent    Jew who knows our people well, knows their history, past,    present, and future, as far as the latter can be known from our    Scriptures and sacred books. Should you care to fall in with my    suggestion, I should be pleased to supply you with the names    and addresses of several good and clever men of our people.                           Yours obediently,                                                    ABRAHAM COHEN.As he folded the letter slowly, Hammond told himself that there wassomething in the letter that drew him towards the writer.I will hunt him up, for it is evident that he is as enthusiastic overhis peoples history as he is intelligent. I will see what to-morrowbrings. Now to work.He put Cohens letter in his pocket, and turned to the hundred and oneeditorial claims upon his time.CHAPTER VIII.REVERIE.In spite of the time of the year, the evening was almost as warm asone in June. Madge Finisterre was on one of the wide hotel balconiesoverlooking the Embankment. She had dined with her cousin, GeorgeCarlyon, but instead of going out of town that evening with himhe hadpressed her strongly to go,she had elected to spend a quiet eveningalone.Londons roar, subdued a little, it is true, at that hour, rose allaround her where she sat. The cup of coffee she had brought to her,cooled where it stood upon the little table at her elbow. She hadforgotten it.Her mind was engrossed with the memory of the latter partthe interruptedpartof that interview with Tom Hammond that afternoon.What would have happened if George Carlyon had not turned up at thatmoment? she mused,if we had been left alone and undisturbed anotherfive minutes?Her cheeks burned as she whispered softly to herself:I believe Tom Hammond would have proposed to me. If he had, what shouldI have replied?A far-away look crept into her eyes. She was back again in the littletown where she had been reared, as she herself would have said. Wehave many villages in England larger, more populous, more busy, than hertown, but, then, the people of her land talk big.Before her minds eye there rose the picture of her fathers store, ahuge, rambling concern built of wood, with a frontage of a hundred feet,and a colonnade of turned wooden pillars that supported a verandah thatran the whole length.Every item of the interior of the store came vividly before her mind,the very odour of the placea curious blend of groceries, drapery, rope,oils and colours, tobacco,seemed suddenly to fill her nostrils. And inthat instant, though she scarcely realized it, the first real touch ofnostalgia came to her.She saw the postal section of the store littered with men, all smoking,most of them yarning. One after another dropped in, and, with a Howdy,all? dropped upon a coil of white cotton rope, or lounged against acounter or cask. Dollars and cents floated in speech all around,while the men waited for the mail. It was late that night.A week before she had sailed for England, she had gone down to the store,as she had gone every evening about mail-time, and, entering at the endnearest her home, she had come upon the scene that had now so suddenlyrisen before her minds eye. She had traversed all the narrow alley-waybetween the stored-up supplies, from which the various departments werestocked, singing as she went:    The world is circumbendibus,      Were all going round;    We have a try to fly the sky,      But still were on the ground.    We every one go round the sun,      Were moving night and day;    And milkmen all go round the run      Upon their Milky Way.    Were all circumbendibus,      Wherever we may be.    Were all circumbendibus,      On land or on sea.    Rich or poor or middling,      Wherever we are found,    Were all circumbendibus,      Were all going round.She had punctuated the chorus with a series of jerked steps, her highheels striking the wooden floor in a kind of castanet accompaniment.Every waiting man had risen to his feet as she came upon them in thatpost-office section, and she had answered their rising with a militarysalute.In the great mirror that ran from floor to ceiling of the store, she hadcaught a glimpse of herself. She recalled, even now, exactly what shewas wearing that eveninga white muslin frock, a very wide sash of richsilkcrushed strawberry colourabout her waist, the long ends of the sashfloating behind her almost to the high heels of her dainty bronze shoes.A knot of the same-hued ribbon, narrow, of course, with streamers flying,was fastened at her left shoulder. Her wide-brimmed hat was trimmed withthe same colour. She had known that she made a handsome picture beforeshe read the light of admiration in the eyes of the post-office loungers.Have you heard the news, boys? she asked.Aw, guess we hev, Miss Madge.It was Ulysses Fletcher who had acted as spokesman.In some surprise, and not altogether pleased, she had wheeled sharplyround to the lantern-jawed Ulysses and asked,How did you hear the news, Ulysses? Dad didnt tell you, Im sure, forhe promised me I should tell you all myself.Met a coon down to the depot, an I guess he wur chuck full o it, ane ups an tells me.A coon told you? she had cried in ever-increasing amazement.Sartin, Miss Madge!A coon! she had repeated. A coontold youdown at the depotthatIwasgoingto Europe next week!Every eye had stared in wondering astonishment at Madge Finisterre ather announcement that she was going to Europe. Then there was a generallaugh, and one of the smartest of the boys had cried:I low theres been a mistake some, Miss Madge, an that, too, all roun.Fact is, weve been runnin two separate tickets over this news business,an thought it wur one an the same. We wur talkin bout Seth Hammondsherd o hogs as wur cut up by the Poughkeepsie express smarnin.She had joined in the laugh, and then in reply to the question of anotherof the men, as to whether it was really true that she was going toUrop, she had replied in the affirmative, adding, by way of explanation:I guess you all know that my momma is British, that she belonged to whatthe Britishers call, the Quality. She was the youngest sister of SirArchibald Carlyon, was travelling over here, out west, when she was aboutmy age, got fixed up in an awkward shop by half-breeds, and was rescuedby my dear old poppa. Fact, thats how he came to be my poppa, for shemarried him. Spite of her high connections in England, she was very poor,and she loved dad. If dear momma could only face the water journey,shed go over with me.Air you goin alone, Miss? one of the boys had asked.Thenhow well she remembered it to-night!she had given the answer, partof which she had given to George Carlyon that very day:Oh, Ill git all right, boys, you can bet on that, without anyonedandying around me. For I guess if theres one thing the Britishers arelearning about our women, its thisthat if a United States gels gotdollars under her boots to wheel around on it aint much fuss for her toskate through their old country, nor yet through Europe, come to that,even if she has no more language under her tongue than good, plain,Duchess county American.With a merry smile, for which there had been no scrambling, since it wasshed upon them all, she had passed on to where she knew she would findher father, ringing her boot-heels, castanet fashion, as she sang lightly:    Marys gone wid a coon,    Marys gone wid a coon;    Deres heaps o trubble on de ole mans min    Since Mary flit wid de coon.How vividly it all came up before her in this hour of quiet reverie! Buther mind flitted swiftly to another scene, one that had been hanging inthe background of all her thought ever since (thinking of Tom Hammondand the interrupted conversation,) she had been reminded of home and itshappenings.There had been a Donation Party for their pastor (Episcopalian Methodist)at the house of one of the members on the very night of the store scene.Madge had gone, of course. Balhang was wont to say that a Donation Partysimply could not be run without her.Sitting on that Embankment hotel balcony, with eyes fixed on the lamps,the river, the bridge, the traffic yet seeing nothing of it all, thatDonation Party all came back to her. Things had been a bit stiff andformal at first, as they often are at such gatherings.The adults sat around and talked on current topicshow much turkeys wouldfetch for Thanksgiving, whether it would pay best to sell them plucked orunplucked, what would folks do for cranberries for Thanksgiving, sincethe cranberry crop had failed that yearAn turkey wiout cranberryaint wuth a twist o the tongue.An squash, suggested one old man. Whats turkey wiout squash? Idmost so soon hev only Boston (i. e., pork and beans) fur dinner as tergo wiout squash wi turkey.The young folk had been moping around like draggled chickens on a wetday when the barn-door is shut. Then, at this juncture, Madge had burstupon the scene. She swam into the largest room, swirling round and roundwith a kind of waltz movement, to the accompaniment of her own gay voiceas she sang:    I said, My dear, Im glad!    Said she, Im glad youre glad!    Said I, Im glad youre glad Im glad,    It is so very, very nice;    It makes it seem worth twice the price,    So glad youre glad Im glad!With a gay laugh she had turned to the hostess, saying;Things want hustling a bit here, Miss Julie. Everyone is as glum as awhip-poor-will that is fixed up with the grippe.In the quiet of that corner of the hotel balcony she smiled at theseremembrances of her nonsense that night. She had started the young peopleplaying their favourite games of Whisper, Amsterdam, etc., in two orthree of the smaller rooms; then had raced away again to the room wherethe adults were sitting squarely against the wall, as grim as brazenimages. Dropping on to the piano stool, she struck a few soft, tendernotes, suggestive of some very gracious hymn, then suddenly broke intosong:        Oh, dats so! Oh, dats so!    Dar is nuffing neath de moon datll satisfy dis coon.        Like a KIdouble S, kiss,    Since dat Cupid, wid his dart, made a keyhole in my heart        For dat MIdouble S, miss.Behind a corner of the curtain the young pastor had watched and listened.He had thought his presence unknown to her. He was mistaken.For three-quarters of an hour she had been the life of that room. Then,suddenly, as she was singing at the piano, the room grew very quiet. Shewas aroused by a voice just behind her ear, saying:Miss Finisterre, are you going to supper with this first batch, or willyou wait the next turn?Turning, she found herself face to face with the young pastor, the roombeing otherwise empty. His gaze was very warm, very ardent. She hadflushed under the power of that gaze.She had railed him on his extra seriousness, and he had answered,Dont, Madge! you must know why I am grave and sad, to-night. (He hadnever called her Madge before.)No, I dont, she had replied.In less than a week, he went on, so I have heard to-night, you leaveBalhang. You are going to Europe, and will be away long months, perhaps ayear.She had gazed at him in honest wonder, not fully grasping his meaning.Why, she asked, should that make you sad?He had leaned closer towards her. There was no one to see them. The heavydoor-curtain had slipped from its hook, and shut them in. Where her handrested on the rounded, polished arm of the piano, his larger hand hadmoved, and her white fingers were clasped in his larger ones. His eyeshad sought hers, and, under the hypnotic power of the strong love in hiseyes, she had been compelled to meet his gaze.I thought, dear, you must have seen how, for a long time, I had learnedto love you, Madge.His clasp on her fingers had tightened. He had leaned nearer to herstill. No mans face, save her fathers, had ever been so close to hersbefore, and the contact strangely affected her. She felt the warmth ofhis breath, the heat of his clean, wholesome flesh; even the scent of thesoap he had usedor was it some perfume in his clothing?filled all hersense of smell.The perfume was violet, and she remembered to-night how, for many a day,she could not smell violets without recalling that moment, and seeingagain the strong, earnest, eager face, with the fire of a mighty loveburning in the eyes.To-night she heard again the yearning, pleading voice as he had cried:Madge, Madge, my darling! Can you ever guess how great is my love foryou? Tell me, dear, do you, can you, love me in return? Will you be mywife? Will you come into all my life to bless it? And let me be whollyyours to help, to bless, to strengthen, to love, to cherish you? Tell me,darling!And she had cried, almost piteously:I dont know how to answer you, pastor. It is all so sudden. I knew, ofcourse, that we were great friends, and I am sure I like you very much,butthis proposal! Why, I never dreamed that you cared for me like that,for how could I be a ministers wife? I am such a gay, thoughtless,foolish little thingIThere had followed more tender pleading, and she had finally said, Ifyou love me, Homer, as you say you do, please do not bother me any morenow. Wait until I come back from EuropethenthenWhat, Madge? he had cried softly, eagerly.If I can honestly say Yes, she had replied, I will and I will noteven wait for you to ask me again.He had bent over her. His gaze held her fascinated. She thought he wasgoing to take toll of her lips before his right was confirmed. But atthat instant there had come a rush of feet, a sound of many voices. Thecurtain was flung aside, just as her fingers strayed over the keys of theinstrument, and the pastor succeeded in regaining his old unseen nook.I guess Miss Julies waitin fur yer, Miss Madge, ter go ter yersupper, bawled an old deacon of the church.She had swept the ivory keys with rollicking touch, and sang in gayeststyle:    Allow me to say Ta-ta!    I bid you good-day. Ta-ta!        I wish I could stay,        But Im going away.    Allow me to say Ta-ta!Amid the uproarious laughter of everyone in the room, she had boundedaway to supper.Except for one moment, when she was leaving the house for home, andhe had helped her on with her cloak, the pastor had not spoken againdirectly to her that evening. He had managed then to whisper,God bless you, my darling! I shall pray for you, and live on the hope Iread in your eyes to-night.It was all this which had risen so strangely before her mind, asto-night, on that hotel balcony, she had begun to ask herself how muchshe really cared for Tom Hammond, and what answer she would have givenhim had he proposed to her that afternoon.I told pastor, she murmured, that night, that I was not sure ofmyself. I am no nearer being sure of myself now than I was then.The scene with Hammond rose up before her, and she added: I am lesssure, I think, than ever!She gazed fixedly where the double line of lamps gleamed on thenear-distant bridge. For a moment she tried to compare the two livesthatof an American Methodist pastors wife, with endless possibilities ofdoing good, and that of the wife of a comparatively wealthy newspapereditor-manager.Should I like to marry a popular man? she asked herself. I readsomewhere once that popular men, like popular actors, make bad husbands,that they cannot endure the tameness of an audience of one.She laughed low, and a little amusedly, as she added, Oh, well, TomHammond has not asked me to marry him. Perhaps he never willandwell,sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Pastor once preached fromthat, I remember.The night had grown cooler. She shivered a little as she rose and passedinto the lighted room beyond.Two hours later, as she laid her head upon the pillow, she murmured, Idont see how I could marry the pastor! Why, I havent got religionyet. I am not converted, as these Britishers would say!CHAPTER IX.A THREAT.Tom Hammond paused before the house that bore the number at the head ofMrs. Joyces letter. It was in a mean street, and his soul went out inpity towards the unfortunate woman, who, with all her refinement, wascompelled to live amid such squalid surroundings.And heart-starved, too, he mused, pityingly. Heart-starved for thewant of love, of sympathy, of the sense of soul-union that makes lifewith a married partner at all bearable.Yus, sir; Mrs. Joss lives yere. Top floor, lef and side. Yer kin gohup!A child had opened the door in response to his knock. Following thedirections given, Tom Hammond climbed the dirty stairs. On the toplanding were two doors. The one on the right was fast shut; that on theleft was ajar a few inches. His approach did not seem to have been heard.Mrs. Joyce, the only occupant of the room, was seated at a bare dealtable, sewing briskly.He stretched out his hand to tap at the door, but some impulse checkedhim for a moment. He had the opportunity to observe her closely, and hedid so.She sat facing the window; the light shone full upon her. She was dressedin a well-worn but well-fitting black gown. Round her throathow pure andwhite the skin was!she wore a white turnover collar, like a nurse, whitecuffs at her wrists completing the nurse idea. Her hairshe had loosenedit earlier because of a slight headachehung in clustering waves on herneck, and was held back behind her ears with a comb on either side. Therewas a rare softness and refinement in the pale face that drooped overher sewing. Seen as Tom Hammond saw her then, Mrs. Joyce was a reallybeautiful woman.He gazed for a few moments at the picture, amazed at the rapidity of hersewing movements.The tragedy of Tom Hoods Song of the Shirt, he muttered, as hewatched the gleam of the flying needle.    Oh, men with sisters dear!      Oh, men with mothers and wives!    It is not linen youre wearing out,      But human creatures lives!        Stitch, stitch, stitch,      In poverty, hunger, and dirt,    Sewing at once, with a double thread,      A shroud as well as a shirt.Under the magnetic constraint of his fixed gaze the woman looked towardsthe door. She recognized her visitor, and with a little glad cry startedto her feet. Tom Hammond pushed the door open and entered the room. Shesprang to meet him.Now that he saw her, he realized the expression of her face had changed.Heavenall the heaven of Gods indwelling pardon, love, peace, had cometo dwell with her. All that she had said in her letter of her new-foundjoy, was fully confirmed by her looks.How good of you to come to see me, Mr. Hammond! she cried, as she feltthe clasp of his hand.How good of you to write me of your new-found happiness! He smiled backinto her glad, eager eyes.He took the chair she offered, and with a question or two sought to leadher on to talk of the subject about which he had come to see her.The very title of the subject, Hammond explained, is perfectly foreignto me.It was all so, _so_ foreign to me, she returned. Then, as swift tearsflooded her eyes, she turned to him with a little rapturous cry, saying,And it would all have been foreign to me for ever, but for _you_, Mr.Hammond. I never, _never_ can forget that but for you my soul would havebeen in a suicides hell, where hope and mercy could never have reachedme. As long as I shall live I shall never forget the awful rush ofsoul-accusation that swept over me, when my body touched the foul watersof that muddy river that night. The chill and shock of the waters I did_not_ feel, but the chill of eternal condemnation for my madness and sinI did feel.I saw all my life as in a flash. All the gracious warnings and pleadingsthat ever, in my hearing, fell from my sainted fathers lips, as hebesought men and women to be reconciled to God, seemed to swoop downupon me, condemning me for my unbelief and sin. Thenthen you came to myrescueandHer tears were dropping thick and fast now.Andmy soulhad respite given in which totoseek Godbecauseyou savedmy body.Overcome with her emotion, she turned her head to wipe away the gratefultears. When next she faced him, her voice was low and tender, her eyesglowed with a light that Tom Hammond had never seen in a human facebefore.Now, if my Lord come, she said softly, rapturously, whether atmorning, at noontide, at midnight, or cock-crowing, I shall be ready tomeet Him in the air.I used to think that if ever I was converted, I should meet my dearfather and mother at the last day, at the great final end of all things.But now I know that if Jesus came for His people to-day, that I shouldmeet my dear ones to-day. For when the Lord Himself shall descend fromheaven ... the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are aliveand remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meetthe Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.Tom Hammond gazed at the speaker in wonder. The glory that filled herface, the triumph and rapture that rang in her voice, were a strangerevelation to him.A starvation wage for making slop-shirts, he mused, yet more thantriumphing over every discomfort of poverty by the force of the divinehope that dominates her! What is this hope?Tell me of this wondrous thing, Mrs. Joyce, he said, aloud, that cantransmute your poverty and suffering to triumph and rapture, and yourcomfortless garret to a heaven on earth.Before I begin, she replied, tell me, Mr. Hammond, have ever you seenthis?From the window-shelf she reached a tiny envelope booklet.Long Odds! he said, reading the boldly-printed title of the book.No; I have never seen this. It sounds sporting, rather.Take it, Mr. Hammond, she went on; if it does nothing else, it willawaken your interest in this wonderful subject.He slipped the book into his breast-pocket. She opened her mouth to speakagain, when a sound from outside caught her ear. She started to her feet;her face turned deadly pale. The next instant the door was flung noisilyopen, and her husband entered the room.The blear-eyed, drunken scoundrel glared at the two seated figures, thenlaughed evilly as he cried,Turned religious? Oho! oho! Like all the rest of your religious people,make a mantlea regular down-to-your-feet ulsterof your religion tocover every blackness and filthiness of life.Silence, you foul-mouthed blackguard!Tom Hammonds lips were white with the indignation that filled him, as heflung his command to the man.Silence yourself, Tom Hammond! bellowed the drunken scoundrel. I knowyou, he went on. Youre a big bug now! Think no end of yourself, and ofyour messing paper. Perhaps youll say you came to invite me to join yourstaff, now that Ive caught you here?His sneering tone changed to one of bitterest hate, as he turned to thewhite, trembling woman.Youre a beauty, aint you? Profess to turn saint; then, when you thinkIm clear away, you receive visits from fine gentlemen! Gentlemen? bah!theyreSilence, you drunken, foul-mouthed beast! again interrupted Tom Hammond.There was something amazing in the command that rang in the indignanttones of his voice.Unless, he went on, you want to find yourself in the grip of the law.For a moment or two Joyce was utterly cowed! then the devil in him rearedits head again, and he hissed,You clear out of here, and remember this; if I have to keep sober for ayear to do it, Ill ruin you, Tom Hammond, I will!He laughed with an almost demoniacal glee, as he went on:I can write a par yet, you know. Ill dip my pen in the acid ofhatehate, the hate of devils, my beautyand then get Fletcher to putthem into his paper. Hes not in love with the Courier, or with TomHammond, the Editor.You scurrilous wretch! It was all that Hammond deigned to reply.Good day, Mrs. Joyce! he bowed to the white-faced woman.For her sake he did not offer to shake hands, but moved away down thestairs.He caught a hansom a few moments after leaving the mean street. Hehad purposed, when he started out that morning, to hunt up his othercorrespondent, the Jew, Abraham Cohen. But after the scene he had justwitnessed, he felt quite unwilling to interview a stranger.I wish, he mused, as he sat back in the hansom, I had not gone nearthat poor soul. I am afraid my visit may make it awkward for her.His eyes darkened as he added: And even for myself. It will be veryawkward if that drunken brute puts his threat into executionand he_will_, I believe. Innuendo is a glass stiletto, which, driven into thevictims character, into his heart and then snapped off from the hilt,leaves no clue to the striker of the blow. And a demon like that Joyce,playing into the hands of a cur like Fletcher, may slay a fellow by aprinted innuendo, and yet the pair may easily keep outside the reach ofthe law of libel.For the first time since the floating of the Courier, his spiritsbecame clouded.Then, too, he muttered, there is this sudden breakdown of Marsden,and, for the life of me, I dont know where to look for a fellow, whomI could secure at short notice, who is at all fit for the Couriers_second_.His face had grown moody. His eyes were full of an unwonted depression.If only, he went on, Bastin had been in England, and were to be gotHe sighed. There was perplexity in the sigh.Where on earth can Ralph be all these years? he muttered.He glanced out of the cab to ascertain his own whereabouts. In twominutes more he would be at the office.CHAPTER X.IN THE NICK OF TIME.As Tom Hammonds cab drew up at the office, another hansom drew up a yardahead of his. The occupant alighted at the same instant as did Hammond,and glanced in his direction. Both men leaped forward, their hands wereclasped in a grip that told of a very warm friendship. Like simultaneouspistol shots there leaped from their separate lips,Tom Hammond!Ralph Bastin?The friends presently passed into the great building, arm linked in arm,laughing and talking like holiday school-boys.Not three minutes ago, as I drove along in my cab, I was saying, Oh! ifonly I could lay my hand on Ralph!They were seated by this time in Tom Hammonds room.Why? What did you want, Tomanything special? the bronzed, travelledBastin asked.Rather, Ralph! My second, poor Frank Marsden, has broken down suddenly;its serious, may even prove fatal, the doctors say. Anyway, he wont befit (if he recovers at all) for a year or more.He leaned eagerly towards his friend as he spoke, and asked,Are you open to lay hold of the post?Yes.When?To-morrow, if you like!Good!Hammond stretched his hand out. Bastin grasped it. Then they talked overterms, duties, etc.But you, man? said Hammond, when the last bit of shop had been talked.Where have you been? What have you been doing?Busy for an hour, Tom? Bastin asked, by way of reply.No!Come round to my diggings, then; not farBloomsbury. We can talk as wego. I shall have time to give you a skeleton of my adventures, to befilled in later. Then, when we get to my hang-out, I can tell you, whenyou have seen _her_, the story of my chief adventure, for it concernsher.Hammond flashed a quick, wondering glance at his friend._Her!_ he said; are you married, then?No, laughed Bastin, but Ive adopted a child. But come on, man!The pair left the office. In the cab, talking very rapidly, Bastin gavethe skeleton sketch of his wanderings, but saying no word of the promisedgreat adventure.Tom Hammond never forgot the first sight of his friends adopted child.There was a low grate in the room, a blazing fire of leaping, flamingcoals in the grate. Curled up in a deep saddle-bag armchair was theloveliest girl-child Hammond had ever seen.She must have been half asleep, or in a deep reverie, but as the two menadvanced into the room she sprang from the chair, and, with eyes gleamingwith delight, bounded to meet Bastin. Wreathing her arms about his neck,she crooned softly over him some tongue of her own.She was loveliness incarnated. Her eyes, black as sloes, were big, round,and wide in their staring wonder at Hammonds appearance. Her hair was amass of short curls. She was dark of skin as some Spanish beauty.Her costume lent extra charm to her appearance; for she wore a long,Grecian-like robe of some light, diaphanous ivory-cream fabric,engirdled at the waist with a belt composed of some sort of glisteningpeacock-green shells, buckled with frosted silver. The simple butexquisite garment had only short shoulder-sleeves, and was cut lowround the throat and neck, and finished thereas were the edges of theshoulder-sleeveswith a two-inch wide band of sheeny silk of the samecolour as the shells of her belt. The opening at the neck of the robewas fastened with a brooch of frosted silver of the same pattern, onlysmaller, as the buckle of the belt.From beneath the silk-bound hem of her robe there peeped bronze slippers,encasing the daintiest little crimsoned-stockinged feet ever used forpedalling this rough old earths crust.Bastin introduced the child. She gave Tom her hand, and lifted herwondrous eyes to his, answering his question as to her health in theprettiest of broken English he had ever heard.A moment or two later the three friends were seatedTom and Bastin inarmchairs opposite each other, the child (Viola, Bastin had christenedher) on a low stool between Bastins knees.Shall we use the old lingoFrench? Bastin asked the question in theBohemian Parisian they had been wont to use together years before.As you please, Ralph, Hammond replied.I have told you hurriedly something of where I have been, Bastin began.But I have reserved my _great_ story until I could tell it to youhere He glanced down at the child at his feet. I heard, he went on,when at La Caribeas everyone hears who stays long in the placethateach year, in spite of the laws of the whites, who are in power, a childis sacrificed to the Carib deities, and I longed to know if it were true.During my first few weeks sojourn on the little island of Utilla, I wasable to render one of the old priests a service, which somehow became soexaggerated in his eyes that there was almost literally nothing that hewould not do for me, and eventually he yielded to my entreaties to giveme a chance to see for myself the yearly sacrifice, which was due in amonths time.During that month of waiting I made many sketches of this wonderfulneighbourhood, and became acquainted with this little Carib maiden,painting her in three or four different ways. The child became intenselyattached to me, and I to her, and we were always together in the daytime.As the time drew near for the sacrifice I noticed that the little onegrew very elated, and there was a new flash in her eyes, a kind ofrapturous pride. I asked her no question as to this change, putting itdown as girlish pride in being painted by the white prince, as sheinsisted on calling me.I need not trouble you, my dear fellow, with unnecessary details of howand where the old priest led me on the eventful night, which was a blackas Erebus, but come to the point where the real interest begins.It was midnight when at last I had been smuggled into that mysteriouscave, which, if only a tithe of what is reported be half true, has beendamned by some of the awfullest deeds ever perpetrated. My priest-guidehad made me swear, before starting, that whatever I saw I would make nosign, utter no sound, telling me that if I did, and we were discovered,we should both be murdered there and then.We had hardly hidden ourselves before the whole centre of the cavebecame illuminated with a mauve-coloured flame that burned up from aflat brass brazier, and seemed like the coloured fires used in pantomimeeffects on the English stage. By this wonderful light I saw a hundredand fifty or more Carib men and women file silently into the cave, andtake up their positions in orderly rows all round the place. When theyhad all mustered, a sharp note was struck upon the carimba, a curiousone-stringed instrument, and the circles of silent savages dropped intosquatting position on their heels. Then the weirdest of all weird musicbegan, the instruments being a drum, a flute, and the carimba.But my whole attention became absorbed by the grouping in the centre ofthe roomthe fire-dish had been shifted to one side, and I saw a hideousstatue, squatted on a rudely-constructed, massive table, the carved handsgripping a bowl that rested on the stone knees of the image. The head ofthe hideous god was encircled with a very curious band, that looked, fromwhere I stood, like bead and grass and feather work. The facecheeks andforeheadwas scored with black, green and red paint, the symbolic coloursof that wondrous race that once filled all Central America.In the back part of the wide, saucer-like edge of the bowl which restedon the knees of the statue, there burned a light-blue flame, and whetherit was from this fire, or from the larger one that burned in the wide,shallow brazier on the floor, I cannot positively say, but a lovelyfragrance was diffused from one or the other.Before this strange altar stood three very old priests, while sevenwomen (sukias,) as grizzled as the men, stood at stated intervals aboutthe altar. One of these hideous hags had a dove in her hand; anotherheld a young kid clasped between her strong brown feet; a third held thesacrificial knife, a murderous-looking thing, made of volcano glass,short in blade, and with a peculiar jagged kind of edge; another of thesehags grasped a snake by the necka blood-curdling-looking tamagas, asnake as deadly as a rattle-snake.Opposite the centre-man of the three old priests stood a girl-child,about ten years of age, and perfectly nude. During the first few momentsthe vapourous kind of smoke that was wafted by a draught somewhere, fromthe fire-pan on the floor of the cave, hid the childs features, thoughI could see how beautiful of form she was; then, as the smoke-wreathpresently climbed straight up, I was startled to see that the child wasmy little friend.In my amaze I had almost given vent to some exclamation, but my oldpriest-guide was watching me, and checked me.My little ones beautiful head was wreathed with jasmine, and a garlandof purple madre-de-cacoa blossoms hung about her lovely shoulders.Suddenly, like the barely-audible notes of the opening music of someorchestral number, the voice of one of the priests began to chant; inturn the two other priests took up the strain; then each of the sevenhags in their turn, and anon each in the first circle of squattingworshippers, followed by each woman in the second row: and in this orderthe chant proceeded, until, weird and low, every voice was engaged.Suddenly the combined voices ceased, and one womans voice alone roseupon the stillness; and following the sound of the voice, I saw that itwas the mother of my little native child-friend. I had not noticed herbeforeshe had been squatting out of sight. Hers was not the chant ofthe others, but a strange, mournful wail. It lasted about a minute anda-half; then, rising to her feet, she gently thrust the child forwardtowards the altar, then laid herself face down on the floor of the cave.The little one leaned against the edge of the altar, and taking up, witha tiny pair of bright metal tongs, a little fire out of the back edge ofthe bowl on the knees of the god, she lighted another fire on the frontedge of the bowl, her suddenly-illuminated face filled with a glowingpride.Then, at a signal from the head priest, the child lifted her two hands,extended them across the altar, when they were each seized by the twoother priests, and the beautiful little body was drawn slowly, gentlyover, until the smooth breast almost touched the sacrificial fire she hadherself lighted.Then I saw the woman who had held the knife suddenly yield it up to thehead priest, and I made an unconscious movement to spring forward.My guide held me, and whispered his warning in my ear: yet, even thoughI must be murdered myself, I felt I dared not see that sweet young lifetaken.Like a man suffering with nightmare, who wants to move, but cannot, Istood transfixed, fascinated, one instant longer. But in that flashinginstant the head priest had swept, with lightning speed, the edge of thathideous knife twice across the little ones breast, and she stood smilingupwards like one hypnotized.The priest caught a few drops of the childs blood, and shook them intothe bowl of the god; then I saw the little one fall into her mothersarms; there was a second sudden flashing of that hideous knife, apiteous, screaming cry, and I gave vent to a yellbut not _voice_ toit,for the watching guide at my side clapped one hand tightly over mymouth, while with the other he held me from flying out into the ring ofdevils, whispering in my ear as he held me back,It is the goat that is slain, not the child.Another glance, and I saw that this was so; one flash of that obsidiansacrificial blade across the throat of the kid had been enough, and nowthe blood was being drained into the bowl of the god.I need not detail all the other hideous ceremonies; they lasted fornearly two hours longer, ending with a mad frenzied dance, in which alljoined save the priests and the mother and child.Every dancer, man and woman, flung off every rag of clothing, andwhirled and leaped and gyrated in their perfect nudity, until, utterlyexhausted, one after another they sank upon the floor.Then slowly they gathered themselves up, reclothed themselves, and leftthe cave. And now some large pine torches were lighted, and my guide drewme further back, that the increased glare might not reveal our presence,and I saw the curious ending to this weird nights work. The priestsand their seven women sukias opened a pit in the floor of the cave byshifting a great slab of stone, and lowered the idol into the pit. Theremains of the kid, the sacrificial knife, and the dove were dropped intothe bowl of blood that rested on the knees of the idol; then the sukiathat had held the tamagas snake during the whole of those hideous nighthours, dropped the writhing thing into the bowl, and the slab was loweredquickly over the pit, every seam around the slab being carefully filled,and the whole thing hidden by sprinkling loose dust and the ashes fromthe fire over the spot.Then, as soon as the last of the performers had cleared the cave, Ifollowed my guide, and with a throbbing head, and full of a sense ofstrange sickness, I went to the house where I was staying.I lay down upon my bed, but could not sleep; and as early as I dared Iwent round to my little Martaraes homeMartarae was her native name. Hermother met me, said that the child would not come out in the sun to-day,that I might see her for a moment if I pleased, but that she was not verywell.Sweet little soul! I found her lying on her little bed, with a proudlight in her eyes, and a very flushed face.A fortnight later the light flesh wounds were healed. She showed me herbreast, confided to me the story, and asked me if I did not think she hadmuch to be proud of.Will you keep a secret? I asked her. She gave me her promise, and Itold her how I had seen the whole thing, and all my fears for her.A week later she was orphaned. Her mother was stung by a deadlyscorpion, and died in an hour, and I made the child my care.She has travelled everywhere with me ever since, and you see how fairand sweet she is, and how beautifully she speaks our English. She isbarely twelve, is naturally gifted, and is the very light of my life.Would she let me see her breast, Ralph, do you think? Hammond asked.Bastin smiled, and spoke a word to the child, and she, rising to her feetand smiling back at him, unfastened the broach at her throat, and, layingback her breast-covering, showed the gleaming, shiny scars. Then as shere-covered her chest, she said softly:Ralph has taught me that those gods were evil; but though I shall everwear this cross in the flesh of my breast, I shall ever love the Christwho died on the worlds great cross at Calvary.It is a most marvellous story, Ralph, he said tearing his eyes awayfrom the childs clear, searching gaze.The more marvellous because absolutely true, returned Bastin.Then, addressing Viola, and relapsing, of course, into English for hersake, he explained who Tom Hammond was, and that he (Ralph) was going tobe associated with him on the same great newspaper.Mr. Hammond and you, Viola, must be real good friends, he added.Sure, daddy! the girl said smilingly; I like him much alreadyShe lifted herself slightly until she rested on her knees, and stretchingone hand across the hearthrug to Tom Hammond, she laid the other in herguardians, as she went on:Mr. Hammond is good! I know, I know, for his eyes shine true.A ripple of merry laughter escaped her, as she gazed back into herguardians face, and added:But you, daddy, are always first.CHAPTER XI.LONG ODDS.For a wonder, Tom Hammond could not sleep. Usually, when the last thinghad been done, and he was assured that everything was in perfect trainfor the mornings issue, he ate a small basin of boiled milk and bread,which he invariably took by way of a night-cap, then went to bed, andslept like a tired ploughman. But to-night slumber would have none of him.It must be the various excitements of the day, he muttered. That storyof Ralphs Caribbean child was enough to keep a fellows brain workingfor a week. Then there was meeting Ralph so unexpectedly, just, too, whenI so lusted for his presence and help. Then there was that Joyce itemHis mind trailed off to the scene of the morning, every item of itstarting up in a new and vivid light. Suddenly he recalled the bookletMrs. Joyce had given him.I cant sleep, he murmured; Ill find that thing and read it.His fingers sought the electric switch. The next moment the room was fullof light. He got out of bed, passed quickly through to his dressing-room,found the coat that he had worn that morning, and secured the booklet.He went back again to bed, and, lying on his elbow, opened the daintylittle printed thing and began to read thus:                               LONG ODDSYou dont say so! Where on earth has she gone?I cant say, sir, but its plain enough she _is_ missing. Hasnt beenseen since last night when she went up to her room.I _was_ put out, I own; my man on waking me had informed me that thecook was missing; she had gone to bed without anything being noticedamiss, and was now nowhere to be found. She was always an odd woman, buta capital cook. What had become of her? The very last sort of person todisappear in this waya respectable elderly Scotchwomanreally quite atreasure in the country; and the more I thought of it while I dressed,the more puzzled I became. I hardly liked to send for the police; andthen again it was awkward, verypeople coming to dinner that day. It wasreally too bad.But I had scarcely finished dressing when in rushed my man again. I do sodislike people being excited, and he was more than excited.Please, sir, Mr. Vend has come round to see you; his coachman hasgonewent off in the night, and hasnt left a trace behind, and they saythe gardeners boy is with him.Well, said I, it is extraordinary; tell Mr. Vend Im coming; stay,Ill go at once.It was really past beliefthe three of them! After an hours talk withVend, no explanation offered itself, so we decided to go to town as usual.We walked down to the station, and saw at once something was wrong. OldWeeks, the stationmaster, was quite upset: his pointsman was missing, andthe one porter had to take up his duty. However, the train coming up, wehad no time to question him, but jumped in. There were three other peoplein the compartment, and really I thought I was going off my head when Iheard what they were discussing. Vend, too, didnt seem to know if he wason his head or his heels. It was this that startled us so: What can havebecome of them all?I heard no more. I really believe I swooned, but at the next stationalarge onewe saw consternation on every face. I pinched myself to see ifI was dreaming. I tried to persuade myself I was. Vend looked ghastly. Apassenger got in; he did not look quite so dazed as some did, but savageand cross. For a time none spoke; at last someone said aloudI dontthink he expected an answerWhat on earths become of them? and the cross looking man, who got inlast, growled out,Thats the worst of it; they are not _on earth_, they are gone. My boyalways said it would be so; from the very first moment I heard it, I knewwhat had happened; often he has warned me. I still have his voice ringingin my ears.I tell you, in _that night_ there shall be two men in one bed: the oneshall be taken, and the other shall be left. (Luke xvii. 34.)I know only too well _that night_ was _last_ night. Ive often prayedfor it without thinking, and so I daresay have you: Thy kingdom come.It makes me so savage I dont know what to do.Now, I was an atheist, and did not believe the Bible. For the last thirtyyears (I am past fifty) I had stuck to my opinions, and when I heard mentalk religious trash I invariably objected.But this seemed altogether different. I tell you, for a thousand poundsI couldnt have said a word. I just hoped it would all turn out a dream,but the further we went, the more certain it became that we were allawake, and that by some unaccountable visitation of Providence a numberof people had suddenly disappeared in the night.The whole of society was unhinged; everybody had to do somebodys elseswork. For instance, at the terminus, a porter had been put into Smithsstall, as the usual man was missing. Cabs were not scarce, but someof those who drove them seemed unlicensed and new to their work. Theshutters in some of the shops were up, and on getting to my bank I heardthe keys had only just been found.Everyone was silent, and afraid lest some great misfortune was coming.I noticed we all seemed to mistrust one another, and yet as each freshclerk, turned up late, entered the counting-room, a low whisper wentround. The chief cashier, as I expected, did not come. The newspapers noone cared to look at; there seemed a tacit opinion that _they_ could tellus nothing.Business was at a standstill. I saw that very soon. I hoped as the daywore on that it would revive, but it did not. The clerks went off withoutasking my permission, and I was left alone. I felt I hated them. I didnot know what to do. I could not well leave, else they might say the bankhad stopped payment, and yet I felt I could not stay there. Businessseemed to have lost its interest, and money its value. I put up theshutters myself, and at once noticed what a change had come over the Citywhile I had been at the bank. _Then_ all were trying to fill the voidplaces; _now_ it seemed as if the attempt had failed.In the City some of the streets had that dismal Sunday appearance,while a few houses had been broken into; but in the main thoroughfaresthere was a dense mass of people, hurrying, it struck me, they knew notwhere. Some seemed dazed, others almost mad with terror. At the stationsconfusion reigned, and I heard there had been some terrible accidents. Iwent into my club, but the waiters had gone off without leave, and onehad to help oneself.As evening came on, I saw the lurid reflection of several fires, but,horrible to say, no one seemed to mind, and I felt myself that if thewhole of London were burnt, and I with it, I should not care. For thefirst time in my life I no longer feared Death: I rather looked on him asa friend.As the gas was not lit, and darkness came down upon us, one heard criesand groans. I tried to light the gas, but it was not turned on. Iremembered there was a taper in the writing-room. I went and lit it, butof course it did not last long. I groped my way into the dining-room,and helped myself to some wine, but I could not find much, and what Itook seemed to have no effect; and when I heard voices, they fell on meas if I were in a dream. They were talking of the Bible, though, and itnow seemed the one book worth thinking of, yet in our vast club library Idoubt if I should have found a single copy.One said: What haunts me are the words Watch therefore. You cant_watch_ now.I thought of my dinner party. Little had I imagined a week ago, when Iissued the invitations, how I should be passing the hour.Suddenly I remembered the secretary had been a religious fanatic, andI made my way slowly to his room, knocking over a table, in my passage,with glasses on it. It fell with a crash which sounded through the house,but no one noticed it. By the aid of a match I saw candles on his writingtable and lit them. Yes! as I thought, there was his Bible. It was openas if he had been reading it when called away, and another book I hadnever seen before lay alongside of ita sort of index.The Bible was open at Proverbs, and these verses, being marked, caught myeye:Because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched out My hand andno man regarded; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock whenyour fear cometh.I had never thought before of God laughingof God mocking. I had fanciedman alone did that. Mans laughing had ended nowI saw that pretty plain.I had a hazy recollection of a verse that spoke of men wanting the rocksto fall on them; so looked it up in the index. Yes, there was the wordRock, and some of the passages were marked with a pencil. One was Deut.xxxii. 15: He forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rockof our Salvation.Perhaps he marked that passage after he had had a talk with me. Howwell I remember the earnestness with which he pressed salvation uponme that dayexplaining the simplicity of trusting Christ and His bloodfor pardonand assuring me that if I only yielded myself to the Lord Ishould understand the peace and joy he talked about. But it was no use. Iremember I only chaffed him, and said mockingly that his God was a myth,and time would prove it, and he answered,Never. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My Word shall not passaway. He may come to-night.I laughed and said, What odds will you take? I lay you long ones.Another passage marked was 1 Samuel ii. 2, Neither is there any rocklike our God, and lower still Man who built his house upon a rock.I had no need to look that out. I knew what it referred to, and then myeye caught Matt. xxvii. 51, The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.That was when Christ died to save sinners, died to save meand yet I hadstriven against Him all my life. I could not bear to read more. I shutthe book and got up. There were some texts hanging over the fireplace:Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blottedout.Acts iii. 19.The blood of Jesus Christ His son cleanseth us from all sin.1 John i.7.Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.2 Cor.vi. 2.As I turned to leave the room these caught my eye, and I said, Well, Ihave been a fool.Tom Hammond looked up from the little booklet,a look of bewilderment wasin his eyes, a sense of blankness, almost of stupefaction, in his mind.Like one who, half stunned, passes through some strange and wondrousexperience, and slowly recalls every item of that experience as fullerconsciousness returns, he went, mentally, slowly over the story of thelittle book.The verisimilitude of the whole story is little less than startling, hemurmured. His eyes dropped upon the book again, and he read the last linealoud: Well, I have been a fool.Slowly, meditatively, he added: And I, with every other otherwise saneman who has been careless as to whether such things are to be, am as biga fool as the man in that book!He laid the dainty little messenger down on the table by his bedside. Hishandling of the book was almost reverential. Reaching to the electriclever, he switched off the light. He wanted to think, and he could thinkbest in the dark.Of course, I know _historically_, he mused, all the events of theChrists life, His death, His resurrection, andandWell, _there_,I think, my knowledge ends. In a vague way I have always known thatthe Bible said something of a great final denouement to all the WorldDramaan award time of some kind, a millennium of perfectperfectwellperfect everything that is peaceful andOh, I dont know much aboutit, after all. I am very much in a fog, I see, for Mrs. Joyce and thatbooklet both speak of a return of Christ into the air, whither certaindead and certain living are to be caught up to be with Him and to beginan eternity of bliss.For a moment or two he tried to disentangle his many thoughts; then, witha weary little sigh, he gave up the task, murmuring: _I_ certainly amnot ready for any such event. If there is to be a hideous leaving behindof the _un_ready, then I should be left to all that unknown hideousness.A myriad thoughts crowded upon his brain. He gave up, at length, theperplexing attempt to think out the problem, telling himself that withthe coming of the new day he would begin a definite search for the realfacts of this great mysterythe second coming of Christ.By an exercise of his will he finally settled himself to sleep.CHAPTER XII.THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH.Will you come into my workroom, Mr. Hammond? It is a kind of sanctum tome as well as a workroom, and I always feel that I can talk freer therethan anywhere else.It was the Jew, Abraham Cohen, who said these words. His visitor was TomHammond. It was the morning after that Tom Hammond had been troubledabout Long Odds and its mysterious subject.Jew and Gentile had had a few moments general talk in the sitting-roomdownstairs, but Cohen wanted to see his visitor aloneto be where nothingshould interrupt their conversation.Tom Hammonds first vision of Cohens workroom amazed him. As we haveseen before, the apartment was a large one, and, besides being aworkroom, partook of the character of a study, den, sanctumanything ofthat order that best pleases the reader.But it was the finished work which chiefly arrested the attention ofTom Hammond, and in wondering tones he cried: It is all so exquisitelywrought and fashioned! But _what_ can it be for?Cohen searched his visitors face with his deep grave eyes.Will you give me your word, Mr. Hammond, he asked, that you will holdin strictest confidence the fact that this work is here in this place, ifI tell you what it is for?I do give you my word of honour, Mr. Cohen. As he spoke, Tom Hammondheld forth his hand. The Jew grasped the hand, there was an exchange ofgrips; then, as their clasp parted, the Jew said:I do not wish to bind you to any secrecy as to the fact that such workas this is being performed in England, but only that you should preservethe secret of the whereabouts of the work and workers. With a suddenglow of prideit flashed in his eyes, it rang in his toneshe cried,This work is for the New Temple!The New Temple? I dont think I quite understand you, Mr. Cohen. Whereis this temple being built? There was amaze in Tom Hammonds voice.It is not yet begun, replied the Jew. That is, the actual rearing hasnot yet begun, though the preparations are well forward. The New Templeis to be at Jerusalem, Mr. Hammond.The ring of pride deepened in his voice as he went on: There can be noother site for the Temple of Jehovah save Zion, the city of our God,beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earththe centre of theworld, Mr. Hammond.As he talked, Tom Hammond, watching him intently, saw how the soul of theman and the hope of the true Israelite shone out of his eyes.Crossing the room to where a chart of the world (on MercatorsProjection) hung on the wall, the Jew took an inch-marked straight-edge,and laying one end of it on Barrow Point, Alaska, he marked the spoton the straight-edge where it touched Jerusalem. From Jerusalem toWrangel Land, Siberia, farthest east, he showed by his straight-edgethat practically he got the same measurement as when from the west. FromJerusalem to North Cape, Scandinavia, and from Jerusalem to the Cape ofGood Hope, he showed again was each practically the same distance.Always, always, is Zion the centre of the inhabited earth! he cried inquiet, excited tones. Moving quickly back to Hammonds side, he said:Did you ever think of this, sir, that, practically speaking, all thenations west of Jerusalem (those of Europe) write from west to eastthatis, towards the city of our God; whilst all the Asiatic races (thoseeast of Zion) write from east to westjust the opposite,but always_towards_ Zion? No, no, sir; there can be no other place on earth for theNew Temple of Jehovah save Jerusalem. Read Ezekiel, from the fortiethchapter, sir, and you will see how glorious a Temple Jehovah is to havesoon. Show the house to the people of Israel, God said in vision to Hisprophet, and let them build it after the sum, the pattern which I showyou. And that, sir, is what we are doing.Who are the _we_ who are doing this? Tom Hammonds face was as full ofwonder as his voice. Who, he continued, makes the plans, gives theorders, finds the funds?Wealthy, patriotic men of our people, sir. We as a race are learningthat soon the Messiah will come, and we are proving our belief bypreparing for the House of our God. Italian Jews all over Italy arecarving the richest marbles; wrought iron, wondrous works in metal, goldand silver ornaments, cornices, chapiters, bells for the high priestsrobes, and a myriad other things are being prepared; so that the momentthe last restriction on our landthe land of our fathers, the land whichJehovah gave unto our forefather Abraham, saying, Your seed shallpossess itis removed, we shall begin to ship the several preparedparts of the Temple to Palestine, as the Gentiles term our land.A curious little smile flittered over his face as he added,The very march of modern times in the East, Mr. Hammond, is all helpingto make the consummation of our work more easy. The new railways laidfrom the coast to Jerusalem are surely part of the providence of our God.When Messiah comes, sir, we shall be waiting ready for Him, I trust.But do you not know, Tom Hammond interrupted, that according toevery record of history as well as the New Testament, all Christendomhas believed, for all the ages since, that the Messiah came nearly twothousand years ago?The _Nazarene_?There was as much or more of pity than scorn in the voice of the Jew ashe uttered the word.How could _He_ be the Messiah, sir? he went on. Could any good thingcome out of Nazareth? Besides, _our Messiah_ is to redeem Israel, todeliver them from the hand of the oppressor, and to gather again into onenation all our scattered race. No, no! a thousand times No! The Nazarenecould not be _our_ Messiah!Turning quickly to Hammond, he asked, Are _you_ a Christian, sir?For a moment Tom Hammond was startled by the suddenness, thedefiniteness, of the question. He found no immediate word of reply.You are a _Gentile_, of course, Mr. Hammond, the Jew went on; but areyou a Christian? For it is a curious fact that I find very few Gentileswhom I have met, even _professed_ Christians, and fewer still who everpretend to live up to their profession.Tom Hammond recovered himself sufficiently to say:Yes, I am a Gentile, of course, and I _suppose_ I amerIt struck him, as he floundered in the second half of his reply, as beingvery extraordinary that he should find it difficult to state why hesupposed he was a Christian. While he hesitated the Jew went on:Why should you say you _suppose_, sir? Is there nothing distinctiveenough about the possession of Christianity to give assurance of it toits possessor? I do not _suppose_ I am a _Jew_, sir (by religion I mean,and not merely by race.) No, sir, I do not suppose, for I _know_ it.There is all the difference in the world, it seems to me, sir, betweenthe mere theology and the religion of the faith we profess. The religionis life, it seems to me, sir; theology is only the science of that life.Both men were so utterly absorbed in their talk that they did not heara touch on the handle of the door. It was only as it opened that theyturned round. Zillah stood framed in the doorway. Cohen, who saw herevery day, realized that she had never looked so radiantly beautifulbefore. She had almost burst into the room, but paused as she saw that astranger was present.Excuse me, she began; I had no idea you had a friend with you,Abraham.She would have retreated, but he stopped her with an eagerCome in, Zillah.She advanced, gazing in curious inquiry at Hammond.This is Mr. Tom Hammond, editor of the Courier, Zillah, Cohenexplained to the young girl. To Hammond he added, My wifes sister,Zillah Robart.The introduced pair shook hands. The young Jew went on to explain toZillah how the great editor came to be visiting him.Tom Hammonds eyes were fixed upon the vision of loveliness that theJewess made. She was going to assist at the wedding of a girl-friend, andhad come to show herself to her brother-in-law before starting. Lovely atthe most ordinary times, she looked perfectly radiant in her well-chosenwedding finery.Tom Hammond had seen female loveliness in many landsEast, North, West,South. He had gazed upon women who seemed too lovely for earthwomenwhose flesh was alabaster, whose glance would woo emperors; women whoseskins glowed with the olive of southern lands, the glance of whose black,lustrous eyes intoxicated the beholder in the first instant: Inez ofSpain, Mousmee of Japan, Katrina of Russia, Carlotta of Naples, Rosieof Paris, Maggie of the Scottish Highlands, Patty of Wales, Kate ofIreland, and a score of other typical beauties. But this Jewish maiden,this Zillah of Finsburyshe was beyond all his thought or knowledge offeminine loveliness.While Cohen talked on for a moment or two, and Zillahs eyes were fixedupon her brother-in-law, Tom Hammonds gaze was riveted upon the lovelygirl.Every feature of her beautiful face became photographed on his brain. Hadhe been a clever artist, he could have gone to his studio and have flungwith burning, brilliant haste her face upon his canvas.He thought of Zenobia as he looked upon her brow. He wondered if ever twosuch wide, black, lustrous eyes had ever shone in the face of a womanbefore, or whether a female soul had ever before been mirrored in sucheyes.Her mouth was not the large, wide feature so often seen in women ofher race, but of exquisite lines, with ripe, full lips, as brilliantin colour as the most glowing coral. Her eyes were fringed with theblackest, finest, silkiest lashes. Her hair was raven in hue and wondrousin its wealth.He realized, in that first moment of full gazing upon her, how fadedevery other female face must ever seem beside her glorious beauty. With astrange freak of mental conjuring, Madge Finisterre and that interruptedtete-a-tete rose up before him, and a sudden sense of relief swept overhim that George Carlyon had returned at the moment that he did.It is all so strange, so wonderful to me, what I have seen and heardhere, he jerked out as Cohen finished his explanation.Hammond spoke to the beautiful girl, whose great lustrous eyes hadsuddenly come back to his face.For a moment or two longer he voiced his admiration of the separatepieces of finished work, and spoke of his own growing interest in theJewish race.The great black eyes that gazed upwards into his, grew liquid with theevident emotion that filled the soul of the beautiful girl. With thefrank, hearty, simple gesture of the perfectly unconventional woman, sheheld forth her hand to Hammond as she said:It is so good of you, sir, to speak thus of my brother-in-laws workand of our race. There are few who speak kindly of us. Even though, as anation, you English give our poor persecuted people sanctuary, yet thereare few who care for us or speak kindly of us, and fewer still who speakkindly to us.Tom Hammond held the pretty, plump little hand that she offered himclasped warmly in his, almost forgetting himself as he gazed down intoher expressive face and listened to her rich musical voice. There was anardency in his gaze that was unknown, unrealized, by himself.The olive of the girls cheeks warmed under the power of his gaze. Hesaw the warm colour rise, and remembered himself, shifted his eyes, andreleased her hand.I must not stay another moment, Abraham, she cried, turning to the Jew.Adah would be vexed if I were late.She turned back to Hammond, but before she could speak he was saying,Good-bye, Miss Robart; I hope we may meet again. What your brother hasalready told me only incites me to come again and see him, for there aremany things I want to know.He shook hands with the girl again. His eyes met hers, and again he sawthe olive cheeks suddenly warm.Ten minutes later he was driving back to his office, his mind in astrange whirl, the beautiful face of Zillah Robart filling all his vision.He pulled himself up at last, and laughed low and amusedly as he murmured,And I am the man whose pulses had never been quickened by the sight orthe touch of a woman until I met herThe memory of Madge Finisterre flashed into his mind. He smiled tohimself as he mused:Even when I seemed most smitten by Madge, by her piquant Americanism,I told myself I was not sure that love had anything to do with myfeelings. Now I know it had not.His eyes filled suddenly with a kind of staring wonder as he cried out,in a low, startled undertone:Am I inferring to myself that this sudden admiration for Zillah Robarthas any element of love in it?He smiled at his own unuttered answer. The cab pulled up at the door ofthe office at that moment. He came back sharply to everyday things.CHAPTER XIII.A DEMON.Madge Finisterre awoke early on the morning after that discussion withherself anent Hammonds possible proposal.With startling suddenness, as she lay still a moment, a vision of thepastor of Balhang came up before her mind. Then a strange thing happenedto her, for a yearning sense of home-sickness suddenly filled her.She tried to laugh at herself for her childishness, as she called it,and sprang from her bed to prepare for her bath. Standing for one instantby the bedside, she murmured:But, after all, it is time I was paddling across again. Who ever heardof anyone from our side staying here through the winter? I must thinkthis all out seriously. Anyway, Ill get my bath, and dress, and go for astroll before breakfast. They say that one ought to see suburban Londonpouring over the bridges into London city in the early morning. Ill gothis morning.Half-an-hour later she was dressed ready for her expedition. As shepassed the office on her way out, they were sorting the morning mail. Shewaited for her letters. There was only one, but it was from home.Racing back to her room, she tore it open with an eagerness born,unconsciously to herself, of the nostalgia that had seized upon herthree-quarters of an hour before.There were two large, closely-written sheets in the letterone from herfather and one from her mother. Each told their own news.She read her fathers first; every item interested her, though as sheread she seemed to feel that there was all through it an underlyingstrain of longing for her return.Dear old poppa! she murmured as she neared the finish of the epistle.Suddenly her eyes took in the two lines of postscript jammed close intothe bottom edge of the first sheet. Her heart seemed to stand still asshe read:Pastor is considered sick. Doctor cant make his case out.Pastor sick! She gasped the words aloud; then, turning swiftly to hermothers letter, she cried: Momma will tell more than this!Her eyes raced over the written lines. Her mother said a little more thanher father had done about the sickness of their friend and pastor; notmuch, though, in actual words, but to the disturbed heart of the younggirl there seemed to her much deeper meaning.An excited trembling came upon her for a few moments. The next instantshe had put a strong curb upon herself, and, folding the letters, andreplacing them in the envelope, she cried out quietly, but sharply:The boat from Southampton sails at two to-day. Ill catch that!The next instant she was divesting herself of her hat and jacket, andbegan to set about her packing.Now and again she talked to herself thus: Sick, is he? Poor old pastor!I guess I know whats the matter with him, and Ill put him right in fiveminutes.She smiled as she went on: I guess, too, Ive found out whats thematter with meI want to be a pastors wife!The next instant her voice was carolling out:    For I tell them they need not come wooing of me,    For my heart, my heart, is over the sea.Her fingers were busy, her mind all the time kept mentally arranging ahost of things.I wonder, she murmured presently, how Uncle Archibald and George willtake my sudden departure? Well, Im glad George is out of town. Hes beenshowing signs of spoons lately with me, so its best, perhaps, that Ishould get off without seeing him.       *       *       *       *       *By eleven that forenoon she had left Waterloo. Her uncle had seen heroff from the station. He wanted to accompany her to Southampton, but shewould not hear of it.I want to be very quiet all the way down, she said, and write someimportant letters. Make my excuses to everybody, and explain that I onlyhad an hour or two to do everything.At the last moment her uncle slipped an envelope into her hand, saying,You are not to open it until you have been travelling a quarter of anhour.Then came the good-byes, andoff.She had been travelling _nearly_ a quarter of an hour when she opened theenvelope. There was a brief, hearty, loving note inside, in her uncleshand-writing, expressing the joy her visit had given him, and his senseof loneliness at her going, and saying:    Please, dear Madge, accept the enclosure in second envelope,    as a souvenir of your visit, from your affectionate                                                          NUNKUMS.She opened the smaller envelope. To her breathless amazement, she found aBank of England note for 1,000. When she recovered herself a little, asmile filled her eyes as she murmured:Fancy an American Methodist pastors wife with a thousand pounds of herown! My!The train was rushing on; she remembered that she had a special letter towrite. She opened her bag and took out writing materials. The carriagerocked tremendously, but she managed to pen her letter. Before shefinally enclosed the letter in an envelope, she took from her purse atwo-inch cutting from the columns of some newspaper or magazine. This sheplaced in the letter.       *       *       *       *       *Tom Hammond had just settled himself down to work when a letter, bearingthe Southampton post-mark, was delivered to him. Opening it, andreading My dear Mr. Hammond, he turned next to the signature. MadgeFinisterre? he cried softly, surprisedly, under his breath. Wonderinglyhe turned back to the first page, and read:You will be surprised to know that when you receive this I shall besteaming down Channel _en route_ for New York. I got letters from homethis morning that made it imperative that I should start at once.I cannot leave without thanking you for all your kindness to me. It hasbeen a pleasure to have known you, and I sincerely hope that we may meetagain some day.Now I am going to take you right into my confidence, Mr. Hammond, forwho so discreet as a prophet?vide The Courier.Yesterday evening, after dinner, I had a long talk alone with myself.I had had a very pleasant tete-a-tete tea with a friendperhaps you mayremember this,and while I went over in mind many things in connectionwith that tete-a-tete, especially the events immediately preceding theinterruption, I suddenly realized a sense of longing for home.A night or two before I sailed from America, our pastor asked me to behis wife. He was awfully in earnest, poor fellow; and I could see howlove for megay, frivolous little mewas consuming him. I was startledat the proposition, and told him frankly that I did not know my ownmind, but that if ever I found out that I loved him, I would come rightaway and tell him so. I found out this morning, when I heard that he wasdangerously sick, that I wanted him as much as ever he wanted me. At thisstage of the letter, please read the cutting enclosed.Wondering what the clipping could have to do with the subject, TomHammond laid down the letter and read the cutting:A king had a son born to him in his old age, and was warned by hisastrologers and physicians, that his son would be blind if he ever sawthe light before he was twelve years old. Accordingly the king builtfor him a subterranean chamber, where he was kept till he was past thefatal age. Thereupon he was taken out from his retreat, and shown allthe beauties of the world, gold and jewels and arms, and carriages andhorses, and beautiful dresses. But seeing some women pass, he asked whatthey might be, and was told, Demons, who lead men astray. Afterwardsthe king asked him which of all the beautiful things he had seen hedesired most, and the prince answered, The demons which lead men astray.I am going back to be demon to my pastor, the letter went on, to leadhimnot astray, I trust, but back to health. Please keep all this inabsolute confidence, for I have not given even a hint of it to my uncle.Whenever you visit the States, be sure to come and visit me, for no onewill be more welcome from the Old Country than yourself.By-the-bye, dear friend, apropos of your remark anent the presence ofa woman to make tea for you, keep the subject well before yourself, andwhen you see the lady who can really satisfy all your ideals, proposequickly, secure her, andhappy thoughtdo America by way of a honey-moon,and come and see me.                          Yours most sincerely,                                                       MADGE FINISTERRE.He smiled as he laid down the letter. For a moment all the bright,piquant personality of the writer filled his vision. Then, with aswiftness and completeness that was almost startling, her face vanishedfrom his mental picturing, and Zillah Robart, in all her radiantloveliness, took the place in his thought and vision.For a brief while he was absorbed in his new vision. The sudden entranceof Ralph Bastin dispelled his dreaming.After a few moments talk, Bastin cried, quite excitedly, I say, Tom,those pars of yours about the Jews are the talk of all Londonour London,I mean, of course.Without breaking the confidence reposed in him by Cohen, Tom Hammond toldhis friend what he had recently discovered as to the Jewish work on thematerials for the New Temple.Thats strange, Tom, returned Bastin. I dropped in now as much asanything to tell you that last night I met Dolly Anstrutheryou rememberher, dont you?the little Yorkshire girl that was learning sculpturewhen we were staying at Paris with Montmarte.She has just come back from Italy, where she has been three years. Shetold me how startled she was to hear from several sources about this NewTemple business. She said she visited a very large studio in Milan, andsaw the most magnificent pillar she had ever seen. She asked the greatartist what it was for, and he said, It is a pillar for the New Templeat Jerusalem.In Rome she visited another great studio, and there she saw a duplicateof the Milan pillar, and was told again, Oh, that is a pillar for thefuture Temple at Jerusalem.In another place, where the most wonderful brass-work in the world isturned out, she saw two magnificent gates; and, on inquiring where theywere destined to be hung, received the same reply, In the future Templeat Jerusalem. What does it all mean, Tom? he added.That is what I want to find out, to be perfectly sure of, Ralph. Myintelligent Jew, of whom I told you, declares that the Messiah is coming.We, as Christiansnominal Christians, I mean, of course,same as you andI, Ralph, dont profess anything moreBastin searched his friends face with a sudden keenness, but did notinterrupt him by asking him what he meant.As nominal Christians, Tom Hammond went on, we believe the Christhas already come. But the question has been aroused in my mind of late(suggested by certain things that I have not time to go into now), doesthe Bible teach that Christ is coming again, and are all these strangemovings among the Jews and in the politics of the world so many signsandThere came an interruption at that moment. The tape was telling of theassassination of a Continental crowned head. Both men became journalists,pure and simple, in an instant.CHAPTER XIV.MAJOR H ON THE COMING!Tom Hammond was riding westwards in the Tube. It was the morning afterthe events narrated in the last chapter. He had just bought from abook-stall a volume of extracts from essays on art in all its branches.He sat back in the comfortable seat of the car dipping into the book.Suddenly an extract arrested his attention.It was evidently a description of the Crucifixion, butmosttantalizingthe head of this page was torn, he could find out nothingabout the authorship. But the extract interested him:Darknesssooty, portentous darknessshrouds the whole scene; onlyabove the accursed wood, as if through a horrid rift in the murkyceiling, a rainy delugesleety-flaw, discoloured waterstreams downamain, spreading a grisly, spectral light, even more horrible than thatpalpable night. Already the Earth pants thick and fast! The darkenedCross trembles! The winds are droptthe air is stagnanta mutteringrumble growls underneath their feet, and some of the miserable crowdbegin to fly down the hill. The horses sniff the coming terror, andbecome unmanageable through fear. The moment rapidly approaches, when,nearly torn asunder by His own weight, fainting with loss of blood,which now runs in narrower rivulets from His slit veins, His temples andbreast drowned in sweat, and His black tongue parched with the fierydeath-fever, Jesus cried, I thirst. The deadly vinegar is elevated toHim.His head sinks, and the sacred corpse swings senseless on the cross. Asheet of vermilion flame shoots sheer through the air and vanishes; therocks of Carmel and Lebanon cleave asunder; the sea rolls on high fromthe sands its black, weltering waves. Earth yawns, and the graves give uptheir dwellers. The dead and the living are mingled together in unnaturalconjunction, and hurry through the Holy City.New prodigies await them there. The veil of the Templethe unpierceableveilis rent asunder from top to bottom, and that dreaded recess,containing the Hebrew mysteriesthe fatal ark, with the tables andseven-branched candelabrumis disclosed by the light of unearthly flamesto the God-deserted multitude.Strange! he mused, as his eyes stared into space, his mind occupiedwith the thought of the extract. Strange how everything of late seems tobe compelling my attention to the ChristChrist past, Christ future.At that instant he heard someone mention the name of his paper. Heglanced in the direction of the voices. Two gentlemen were talkingtogether. It was evident that his own identity was utterly unknown tothem.Youre right, youre right, the second man was saying. A very cleverfellow, evidently, that editor of the _Courier_.You have noticed, of course, the first man went on, those strikingparagraphs, of late, about the Jews. Though, to a keen student of thesubject, they show a very superficial knowledge; still, it is refreshingto find a modern newspaper editor writing like that at all.Yes, the other said, but it is strange how few people, even Christianpeople, ever realize how intimately the future of the Jewish race isbound up with that other shamefully neglected truththe coming of theLord for His Church. I wish the editor of the _Courier_, and every othernewspaper editor, could be induced to go this afternoon and hear MajorH speak on these things at the  Room.British Museum! called the conductor of the car. The two talkersgot out. Tom Hammond also alighted. As he mounted in the lift to thestreet, he decided that he would hear this major on the subject that wasoccupying his own perplexed thought so much.Three oclock that afternoon found him one of a congregation of threeto four hundred persons in the  Room. He was amazed at the quality ofthe audience. He recognized quite a dozen well-known London clergymenand ministers, with a score of other equally well-known laymenliterarymen, merchants, etc. All were of a superior class. There was a largesprinkling of ladies, who, in many cases, were evidently sisters.Unaccustomed to such meetings, Tom Hammond did not know how enormous isthe number of Christian women who are to be found at special religiousgatherings, conventions, etc.There was a subdued hum of whispering voices in the place. The humsuddenly ceased. Tom Hammond glanced quickly towards the platform.Half-a-dozen gentlemen and one or two ladies were taking their seatsthere. They bowed their heads in silent prayer.A minute later a tall, fine looking man, the centre one of the platformgroup, rose to his feet and advanced to the rail. He held a hymn-book inhis hand. His keen eyes swept the faces of the gathered people. Thenin a clear, ringing voice like the voice of a military officer on thebattle-field, he cried:Number three-twenty-four. Let every voice ring out in song.Tom Hammond opened the linen-covered book that had been handed to him ashe entered, and was almost startled to note the likeness of the sentimentof the hymn to the poem of B. M., which had struck him so forcibly thatnight in his office.The major gave out the first verse:    It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,    When sunlight thro darkness and shadow is breaking,    That Jesus will come in the fulness of glory,        To take out of the world His own.The major paused a moment to interpolate, Let the gladness of thethought ring out in your voices as you sing, but especially in thechorus.        O Lord Jesus, how long?    How long ere we shout the glad song        Christ returneth! Hallelujah!        Hallelujah! Amen!The singing of that hymn was a revelation to Tom Hammond. He had heardhearty, ringing, triumphant song at Handel festivals, etc., but among therank and file, so to speak, of Christians he had never heard anythinglike the singing of that verse and chorus.A hundred thoughts and conflicting emotions filled him as he realized, asthe hymn went on, that these people were really inspired by the glorioushope of the return of the Christ. Once he shuddered as the thoughtpresented itself to his mind,How should _I_ fare if this Christ came suddenlycame now?Twice over the last verse was sung, the quiet rapture of the singersbeing doubly accentuated as the glorious words rang out:    Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go without dying!    No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying;    Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,        When Jesus receives His own.With the last-sung note the voice of the Major rang out again:General Sir R. P. will lead us in prayer.The hush that followed was of the tensest. It lasted a full half-minute,then the old generals voice led in a prayer such as Tom Hammond hadnever even conceived possible to human lips, and such as, certainly, hehad never heard before. It awed him, and at the same time revealed to himthat real Christianity was something which he, with all his knowledge ofmen and things, had never before come in contact with.The prayer concluded, not a moment was wasted. In his clear, ringingtones, the major began:Turn with me, if you will, dear friends, to the first chapter of theActs of the Apostles, and the eleventh verse.Tom Hammond wished that he had a Bible with him. It seemed to him thathe was the only person there without one. In an instant every Bible wasopened at the passage named. There was no searching, no fumbling. Thiswas another revelation to him.They know their Bibles, he mused, better than I do my dictionary orencyclopdia.But his attention was suddenly riveted on the major, who, pocket Bible inhand, was saying;Suffer me, friends, to change one word in my reading, that the truth maycome home clearer to our hearts. Ye men of London, ... This same Jesuswhich is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as yehave seen Him go into heaven.He paused for one instant, then went on: The second coming of our Lordand Saviour Jesus Christ is, I believe, the central truth of real, trueChristianity at this moment, and it should be carefully, diligentlystudied by every converted soul. It should be comprehended as far asScripture reveals it, and so apprehended that we should live in daily,hourly expectancy of that return. Moody, the great evangelist, towhom the whole subject (as he tells us) was once most objectionable,upon studying the Word of God for himself, in this connection, was soprofoundly impressed with the insistence with which the return of theLord was emphasized, that he was compelled to believe in it, and topreach it, saying, It is almost the most precious truth of all theBible. Why, one verse in thirteen throughout the New Testament is said toallude to this wondrous subject in some form or another.Many of you who are present this afternoon are not only conversantwith this glorious matter, but are living in the glad expectancy of thereturn of your Lord. But there are sure to be some here to-day to whomthe whole subject is foreign, and to youeven if there be only one suchIshall speak as plainly, frankly, simply, yearningly, as though we weretete-a-tete.CHAPTER XV.THE ADDRESS.Now to begin. Even in the Church of God there are whole multitudes towhom the very title of this afternoons address is but jargon. They willnot search the Word for it, they will barely tolerate its mention. Why?Oh, say some, hidden things are not to be searched into. Others thereare who spiritualize every reference to the Lords second coming, andsay, Yes, of course, He has come again, He has come into my heart, orhow else could I have become a child of God.To these last, these dreamers, we would respectfully say, A coming intothe air for His people, to take them up, is a totally different thingto coming into the heart to indwell as Saviour and Keeper while we aretravelling lifes pathway.There is another section of the Christian Church who say, We do notwant to hear anything about it. Our minister dont hold with it; itis not a doctrine of our church. Now, such an argument as this isblasphemous, since, if God has put it into His Word, it is blasphemy toignore it, to refuse to believe it.Two distinct advents are plainly taught in Scripture. The first,of Jesus birth as a Babe in Bethlehem, the second as Son ofManglorified, who shall come in the clouds. Now, every Christian willadmit, nay, more, the very worldling admits the fact that every Scripturerelating to the first advent, as to time, place, circumstances, wasliterally fulfilled, even to the minutest detail. Then, in the name ofcommon-sense, with the same covenant Scriptures in our hands, why shouldwe not expect to see the predictions relating to the second advent alsofulfilled to the very letter?We have our Lords own definite promise in John fourteen: If I go, Iwill come again and receive you unto Myself. We are all agreed that Hewent. Well, in the same breath He said, I will come again. Can anyEnglish be plainerAnd receive you unto Myself? That promise cannotallude to conversion, and it certainly cannot allude to death, for deathis a going to Himif we are saved.This expectancy of Christs return for His people was the only hope ofthe early Church; and over and over again, in a variety of ways in theepistles it is shown to be the only hope of the Church, until that Churchis taken out of the world, as a bride is taken by the bridegroom from herold home, to dwell henceforth in his. There never has been any comfortto bereaved ones in the thought of death, nor to any one of us who areliving is there any comfort in the contemplation of death, save andexcept, of course, the thought of relief from weariness and suffering,and in being translated to a painless sphere, to be with Christ. But inthe contemplation of the coming of Christ, when the dead in Christ shallrise, and those who are in Christ, who are still living when He comes,there is the certainty of the gladdest meeting when all are caught uptogether in the air, to be for ever with the Lord. No waiting until theend of the world but, if He came this afternoonand this may happenyouwho have loved ones with Christ would that very instant meet them in theair, with your Lord.Tom Hammond listened intently to every word of the majors, and, asScripture after Scripture was referred to, he saw how the speakersstatements were all verified by the Word of God.There are two points I would emphasize here, the major went on. First,that we must not confuse the second coming of the Lordthe coming in theairfor His saints, with that later coming, probably seven years after,when He shall come with His saints to reign.And, secondly, to those to whom this whole subject may be new, I wouldsay, you must not confuse the second coming of our Lord with the end ofthe world. The uninstructed, inexperienced child of God feels a quakingof heart at all talk of such a coming.Such people shrink from the suddenness of it. They say that there is nopreparatory sign to warn us of that coming. But that is not true.The Word of God gives many instructions as to the signs of Christs nearreturn, and the hour we live in shows us these signs on every hand, sothat it is only those who are ignorant of the Word of God, or those whoare carelessly or wilfully blind to the signs around (and this applies,we grieve to say, as much to ministers as to people,) who fail to see hownear must be the moment of our Lords return.The first sign of this return is an awakening of national life among theJews, that shall immediately precede their returnin unbeliefto theirown land. Please turn with me to Matthew twenty-four.There was again that soft rustle of turning leaves that had struck TomHammond as so remarkable. Someone behind him, at the same instant,passed a Bible, open at the reference, to him over his shoulder. With agrateful glance and a murmured word of thanks, he accepted the loan ofthe book.I will read a verse or two here and there, the major announced. Youwho know your Bibles, friends, will readily recall the subject-matter ofthe previous chapter, and how our Lord after His terrible prediction uponJerusalem, added, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For Isay unto you, Ye shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessedis He that cometh in the name of the Lord.This is Jewish, of course, but the whole matter of the future of theJews and of the return of the Lord for His Church, and, later on, withHis Church, are bound up together. Presently, after uttering His lastprediction, the disciples came to Him privately, saying,Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thycoming, and of the end of the world?Keep your Bibles open where you now have them, friends, and notethisthat the two-fold answer of our Lords is in the reverse order tothe disciples question. In verses four and five He points out whatshould not be the sign of His coming. While, in verse six, He shows whatshould not be the sign of the end of the world. With these distinctions Ishall have more to say another day.This afternoon I want to keep close to the signs of the coming of theLord. Read then the thirty-second and third verses: Now learn a parableof the fig-tree: when its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all thesethings, know thatlook in the margins of your Bible, please, and notethat the it of the text becomes He, which is certainly the only wisetranslationwhen ye shall see all these things, know that He is near,even at your doors.Now, I hardly need remind the bulk of you, friends, gathered here thisafternoon, that the fig-tree, in the Gospels, represents Israel. TheBible uses three trees to represent Israel at different periods of herhistory, and in different aspects of her responsibility.The Old Testament uses the vine as the symbol of Israel, the Gospels thefig, and the Epistles the olive. At your leisure, friends, if you havenever studied this, do so. You will not be puzzled much over the blastingof the barren fig-tree when you have made a study of the whole of thissubject, because you will see that it was parabolic of Gods judgment onthe unfruitful Jewish race.Now, with this key of interpretation before us, how pointed becomes thisfirst sign of the return of our Lord. When, He says, the fig-treeputteth forth her leaveswhen the Jewish nation shows signs of a revivalof national life and vitality,then know that the coming of the Lorddraweth nigh.The careful reader of the daily press, even though not a Christian,ought to have long ago been awakened to the startling fact that, afterthousands of years, the national life of Israel is awakening. The Jew isreturning to his own landPalestine.Only a year or two ago the world was electrified by hearing of theformation of that wonderful Zionist movement. How it has spread andgrown! And how, ever since, the increasing thousands have been flockingback to Palestine! There are now nearly three times the number of Jewsin and around Jerusalem, that there were after the return from theBabylonish captivity. Agricultural settlements are extending all over theland. Vineyards and olive-grounds are springing up everywhere.Now note a remarkable fulfillment of prophecy. Turn to Isaiah xvii. 10,11: Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it withstrange slips. In the day thou shalt make thy plant to grow, and in themorning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish; but the harvest shall be aheap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.In the early months of eighteen-ninety-four the Jews ordered twomillion vine-slips from America, which they planted in Palestine. Thereis the fulfillment of the first part of that prophecy, and if we arejustified in believing, as we think we are, that the return of the Lordis imminent, then, as the tribulation will doubtless immediately followthat return, and of the taking out of the Church from the world, then thegreat gathering in of the harvest of those vines will be in the day ofgrief and of desperate sorrow.Now, let me read to you, friends, an extract from the testimony of anexpert, long resident in Palestine:There is not the shadow of a doubt, he writes, as to the entirechanging of the climate of the land here (Palestine). The former andlatter rains are becoming the regular order of the seasons, and this isdoubtless due (physically, I mean) to the fact that the new colonists areplanting trees everywhere where they settle. The land, for thousands ofyears, has been denuded of trees, so that there was nothing to attractthe clouds, etc.Comparing the rainfall for the last five years, I find that therehas been about as much rain in April as in March; whereas, comparingfive earlier years, from 1880-85, I find that the rainfall in April wasconsiderably less than in March, and if we go back farther still, we findthat rain in April was almost unknown.Thus God is preparing the land for the people. The people, too, arebeing prepared for the land. The day is fast approaching when the Lordwill arise and have mercy upon Zion.I need hardly, I think, tell you what even the secular press hasbeen giving some most striking articles about quite recently,namely,the quiet preparation on the part of the Jews of everything for therebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem.I see, by the lighting up of your faces, that you are familiar with thefact that gates, pillars, marbles, ornaments, and all else requisitefor the immediate building of the new temple are practically complete,and only await the evacuation of the hideous Mohamedan, with all hisabominations, from Jerusalem, to be hurried to the site of the oldtemple, and to be reared, a new temple to Jehovah, by the Jew. Any day,Turkeythe sick man of the Eastin desperate straits for money, maysell Palestine to the Jews.The Jews are to return to their land in unbelief of Christ being theMessiah. They will build their temple, reorganize the old elaborateservices, the lamb will be slain again between the two evenings,andbut all else of this time belongs to another address. What we have tosee this afternoon is that the fig-treethe Jewish nationis budding, andto hear Jesus Christ saying to us, When ye see all these things, knowthat He is near, even at the doors.Another sign of the return of our Lord is to be the world-widepreaching of the Gospel. Now, in this connection, let me give a word ofcorrection of a common error on this point.The Bible nowhere gives a hint that the world is to be converted beforethe return of the Lord for His Church. As a matter of fact, the worldthetimesare to grow worse and worse; more polished, more cultured,cleverer, better educated, yet grosser in soul, falser in worship. Thebulk of the Church shall have the form of godliness, but deny the power.Men shall be lovers of their own selveswho can deny that selfishnessis not a crowning sin of this age?covetouslook at the heapingup of riches, at the cost of the peace, the honour, the very bloodof others,incontinentthe increase in our divorce court cases isalarming, disgusting,lovers of pleasurethe whole nation has run madon pleasures.I need not enlarge further on this side of the subject, save to repeatthat the Word of God is most plain and emphatic on this point, that thereturn of our Lord is to be marked by a fearful declension from vitalgodliness. But, with all this, there is to be a world-wide proclamationof the truth of salvation in Jesus. Not necessarily that every individualsoul shall hear it, but that all nations, etc., shall have it preached tothem.Now, in this connection, let me mention a fact that has deeply impressedme. It is this, that the greatest reawakening in the hearts of individualChristians in all the churchesEngland, America, the Coloniesastestified to by all concerned, agrees, in time, with the awakening ofthe Church of Christ to the special need of intercession for foreignmissionsnamely, from 1873-75.I must close for this afternoon, lest I weary you. We will, Godwilling, come together again here on Tuesday at the same hour, and Ipray you all to be much in prayer for blessing on the attempt to open upthese wondrous truths, and pray also that the right kind of people may begathered in. Will you all work for this, as well as pray for it? Invitepeople to the meetings.Do either of you know any editors of a daily paper? If so, write tosuch, draw attention to these expositions, urge your editors to come. Oh,if only we could capture the daily press! What an extended pulpit, what afar-reaching voice would our subject immediately possess!I dont quite know how far I ought to go on this line, but even as Ispeak, it comes to me to ask you if any one here present is acquaintedwith the evidently-gifted, open-minded editor of The Courier. We haveall, of course, been struck by his own utterances from the ProphetsChamber column. Oh that he could be captured for Christ; then his paperwould doubtless be a clarion for his Lord!Tom Hammond turned hot and cold. He trusted that no one had recognizedhim. He would be glad to get away unrecognized. Yet he was not offendedby the speakers personal allusion to him. He felt that the majors soulrang true.Before I close, the major went on, suffer me to read an extract fromthe Gentlemans Magazine, of the year seventeen hundred and fifty-nine:Mr. Urban,Reading over chapter eleven, verse two, of Revelation, athought came to me that I had hit upon the meaning of it which I desireyoull publish in one of your future magazines. The verse runs thus:But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not,for it is given to the Gentiles, and the holy city shall they tread underfoot forty and two months.Now, according to the Scriptural way of putting a day for a year, ifwe multiply forty-two months by thirty (the number of days contained ina Jewish month,) we have the time the Turks will reign over the Jewscountry, and the city of Jerusalemviz., 1,260; which, if we add to theyear of our Lord 636, when Jerusalem was taken by the Turks, we havethe year of our Lord 1896, near or about which time the Jews will bereinstated in their own country and city, Jerusalem, again, which will beabout 137 years hence; and that the Turks are the Gentiles mentioned inthe above-quoted chapter and verse appears from their having that countryand city in possession about 1,123 years, and will continue to possess ittill the Omnipotent God, in His own time, bringeth this prophecy to itsfull period.This letter is signed M. Forster, and is dated from Bessborough,October 24th, 1759. I have very little sympathy with those of ourbrethren who are ever venting in speech and in print the exact dates(as they declare) of the coming events surrounding the return of ourLord, but I do believe (in spite of the somewhat hazy chronology atour command) that the regarding of approximate times is perfectlypermissible, and the letter I have read you has some value when, takingdates, etc., approximately, we remember that this letter was writtennearly a hundred and fifty years ago, and that 1896 was memorable for adistinct movement towards the Holy Land.So, I say, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. To myself and to everyChristian here, I would say, May God help us to quicken all our hearts,and purify all our lives, that we may not be ashamed at His coming.And to any who are here (if such there be) who are not converted, mayGod help you to seek His face, that you may not be left, when He shallsuddenly, silently snatch away His Church out of this godless generation.Left!Think of what that will mean, unsaved friend, if you are here to-day.Left! Left behind! When the Spirit of God will have been taken out of theearth. When Satan will dwell on the earthfor, with the coming of Christinto the air, Satan, the prince of the power of the air, will have todescend.Christ and Satan can never live in the same realm. Oh, God, save anyonehere from being leftleft behind, to come upon the unspeakable judgmentswhich will follow the taking out of the world of the Church!    Some husband, whose head was laid on his bed,      Throbbing with mad excess,    Awakes from that dream by the lightning gleam,      Alone in his last distress.    For the patient wife, who through each days life,      Watched and wept for his soul,    Is taken away, and no more shall pray,      For the judgment thunders roll.    And that thoughtless fair who breathed no prayer,      Oft as her husband knelt,    Shall find he is fled, and start from her bed      To feel as never she felt.    The children of day are summoned away;      Left are the children of night.It is high time for us all to awake. God keep us awake and watching forour Lord, for His precious names sake. Amen.The murmured Amens rolled through the congregation like the deep surge ofa sea billow on a shingle shore.Our time has gone, friends, cried the major. We will sing two versesonly of the closing hymn 410, the first and last verse. Sing straightaway.Tom Hammond, wondered at it all much as ever, listened while the songrang out:    When Jesus comes to reward His servants,      Whether it be noon or night,    Faithful to Him will He find us watching?      With our lamps all trimmed and bright?    CHORUS.      Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?        Ready for the souls bright home?      Say, will He find you and me still watching,        Waiting, waiting, when the Lord shall come?    Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching      In His glory they shall share:    If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,      Will He find us watching there?Again the chorus rang out, and as Tom Hammond left the hall, the questionof it clung to him. It forced itself upon his brain; it groped about forhis heart; it clamoured to be hearkened to.CHAPTER XVI.HER CABIN COMPANION.Therell be one other lady with you in your cabin, miss.The berth-stewards announcement in no way disconcerted Madge Finisterre.She had had two cabin companions on the outward voyage.She was arranging her cabin necessaries when her fellow-travellerentered. She was a wee, winsome girl, very fragile in appearance, with ayearning sweetness in her great grey eyes, such as Madge had never seenin any eyes before. With half-a-dozen words of exchanged greeting and avery warm handshake, the pair became instant friends.By a strange but happy coincidence neither of them ever suffered fromsea-sickness, and from the first moment of the great liners departurethey became inseparable.As the vessel forged her way down Channel that evening, a glorious moonshining down upon them, the two girls, arm-in-arm, paced the promenadedeck talking. The subject of the acute distress among the poor andout-of-works in all the worlds great cities came up between them.Oh, if only our Lord would come quickly! cried the girlKate Harlandwas her name.What do you mean, Kate? Madges voice was full of amazed wonder.I mean thatThe fragile girl paused; then, glancing quickly up into Madges face, shecried:You love Jesus, of course, Madge? You are saved, dear, and looking forHis coming?For an instant Madge was silent. Then, with a deep sigh, she replied:Oh, me! I am afraid I am not saved, as you call it. Katie, dear, thefact isShe halted in her speech. She did not know how to put into words all thather friends question had aroused within her.While she halted thus, the girl at her side put her arms about her,clasping her with a kind of yearningan I will not let you go kind ofclaspas she cried, softly:Oh, my darling, you must not lie down to-night until you know you areChrists. Thenthenafter that, nothing can ever matter. Come weal, comewoe, come life, come death, all is well!       *       *       *       *       *It was past midnight before the two girls climbed into their berths, butby that time Madge Finisterre knew that she had passed from death intolife.Before the vessel reached New York she had learned something of the truthof the near return of the Lord.On the quay, when they landed, the two girls bade each other a sorrowfulfarewell.We shall meet in heaven, Katie, if nevermore on earth, sobbed Madge.In the air, my darling, replied the other. Do not let us lose sight ofthat. When our Lord shall come,    Loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise,    Caught up together to Him in the skies,      When Jesus shall come once again.Kate Harlands friends, who had travelled to meet her from Denver,carried her off, and Madge took the car to the Central.One hour later she boarded the train and began the last lap of her longjourney.Her spirits rose higher every moment. She had conceived a very bold idea,and she was going to carry it through after her own fashion. She sent nomessage of warning of her coming, as this would spoil her little plot.Her eyes rested delightedly upon every place she passed. At Garrisons,where the train waited a few minutes, she caught a glimpse of the fatherof the man whom she was hurrying to meet.The white-haired old father lived at Garrisons, and was a preacher ofthe Gospel, like his son. He was leaving the depot as her train pulledup. She easily recognized him, because several times during his sonspastorate at Balhang he had been to see him, staying a week at a time,and preaching once on the Sunday on each occasion.At Duchess Junction she had to change trains. To her joy, she met no onefrom Balhang; there was not a soul at the depot whom she even knew bysight.Just before her train reached Balhang she donned a thick brown gauzeveil. No one could see her face through this to recognize it. Therewould be nothing to detain her at the depot, for her baggage was allexpressed.The train stopped; she alighted. Several people peered hard at her, thedepot manager especially, as he took her check, but no one recognizedher. She passed on. Twenty yards from the depot she met Judge Anstey.She stopped him with a Good day, Judge; can I speak with you?Certainly, madam, the official replied genially.Come aside, Judge, she whispered. I dont want anyone to recognize me,or to hear what I am saying to you, should people pass.As he moved on by her side in the direction she wished, she whispered:I have put on this thick veil, Judge, so as not to be recognized. I amMadge Finisterre.Du say! he gasped. I knew the voice, but could not recall whose itwas. I hadnt heard a breath of your coming home, Miss Madge.I let no one, not even mumma and poppa, know that I was coming, shereplied. The fact is, JudgeShe was glad, as she prepared to take him into her confidence, that thethick veil would hide the hot colour that she felt leaped into her face.Momma wrote me, she went on, that the pastor was very sick, andthat the doctor didnt understand his case. I only got the letter lastSaturday morning. The boat was to start that day at two; but I caught it,for I knew that would cure the pastor.She felt how fiercely the blushes burned in her cheeks, but, assured thathe could not see them, she went on:Just before I started for Europe, Judge, pastor told me he loved me, andasked me to be his wifeShe watched the amused amaze leap into the Judges face, and smiledherself at his low whistle.I told him, she continued, I could make him no definite promise, as Iwas not quite sure of myself; but that, when I was, I would not wait forhim to ask me againI would come and tell him. I am going straight to himnow, Judge, and I want you to give me a clear quarter of an hours start.While I am gone to fix him up and to make him happy, I want you to golong to mumma and poppa, and bring them right along with you, and marryme and pastor as soon as you git up to us. So-long for a quarter of anhour.Without another word she moved swiftly away.Shes tropical! he laughed, as he saw her making for Mrs. Kellers,where the pastor boarded.       *       *       *       *       *The French windows of the pastors sitting-room were open, for the daywas like a spring one. Madge moved quickly across the patch of grass,mounted the stoop, and peered in.In a large rocker, looking very frail and ill, the young pastor was lyingback with his eyes closed.Madge felt her eyes fill with tears. She lifted the disguising veil, andwiped the salt drops away. She did not lower her veil again, but with alittle glad cry ofHomer, dear love! she crossed the threshold, and dropped on her kneesby his side, flung her arms around his neck, and laid her hot lips to his.It was like a dream to hima wondrous, delicious dream. His thin armsclasped her. His kisses were rained upon her, but at first he found nowords to say. Between their passionately-exchanged kisses she poured out,in rapid, caress-punctured speech, how she came to be there.I have not seen mumma or poppa yet, she explained; but I met JudgeAnstey down by the depot. I have sent him home for mumma and poppa; theywill be here in no time now. The Judge will come with them, and willmarry us right off, dear. For, say, you do want some nursing.He found his voice at last, declared that her coming, her first kiss, hadmade him strong; that he would need no nursing now that she had come.Getting on to his feet, he gathered her into his arms, and rained freshkisses upon her lips, her cheeks, her brow, her eyes.She managed to whisper the good news, I have found Jesus, dear, or Hefound me, and nowA sound of voices and of hurrying steps outside checked her. She had onlytime to tear herself from his arms when her mother and father reached herside.An hour later, when the Judge had been and gone again, Madge Finisterrewas the wife of the pastor.CHAPTER XVII.CASTING A SHOE.It was two hours after midnight when Tom Hammond was free at last. Buthe did not go to bed. His soul was disturbed. What he had heard at themajors meeting had stirred a myriad disquieting thoughts within him, andnow that he was clear to do it, he shut himself up alone with a Bible,and began to go over every point of the majors address. He had takencopious notes in shorthand, paying especial attention to the texts quotedand referred to.At the end of an hour he looked up from his Bible. There was a wonderingamaze in his eyes, a strange, perplexed knitting of his brows.It is all most marvellous! he murmured. There is not a flaw or hitchanywhere in the majors statements or reasoning. The Scriptures prove, tothe hilt, every word that he uttered.He smiled to himself as, rising to his feet, he said aloud,I should not sleep if I went to bed; I will go out.There are ways of getting into some of the London parks before theregulation hour for opening the gates. Tom Hammond had often found a wayto forestall the park-opener.Ten minutes after leaving his chambers he was inside the park he lovedbest. Everything was eerily still and silent. The calm suited his mood.He wanted to feel, as well as to be, absolutely alone. He had hisdesire. There had been a thick mist over London overnight, but theatmosphere was as clear as a bell now. The air was as balmy as a morningin May or September.There was a faint light from the stars that stabbed the deep violet sky.He moved slowly, thoughtfully, through paths as familiar to him as therooms he occupied at home.And the Christ might come to-day! he mused. As Major H showedplainly from the Bible, there is no other prophetic event to transpirebefore His coming.Almost unconsciously he paused in his walking.If, he cried softly, a certain fearsomeness in his voice, if He cameto-day, came now, what about me? Where should I come in?He recalled the fact that, according to the majors showing, he, TomHammond, was quite unprepared for Christs coming, because he was stillunsaved. He shivered slightly as the thought of his unpreparedness cameto him.With the flashing swiftness of one of memorys freaks, there leaped intohis mind some lines of Charles Wesleys. He had written them, a day ortwo before, in illustration of a certain statement in an article onhymnology. They had not borne any message to his soul then, but now theyseemed like the voicing of his own inmost thoughts.He walked slowly on, the words falling from his lips in half-utterednotes.    And am I only born to die?    And must I suddenly comply      With natures stern decree?    What after death for me remains    Celestial joys, or bitter pains,      To all eternity?    No room for mirth or trifling here,    For worldly hope, or worldly fear,      If life so soon is gone    If now the Judge is at the door,    And all mankind must stand before      The inexorable throne!    Nothing is worth a thought beneath,    But how I may escape the death      That never, never dies    How make my own election sure,    And, when I fail on earth, secure      A mansion in the skies.There was something inspiring, something helpful, in the last verse, hemused, but, for the life of me, I cannot recall it.The piping note of a robin from a clump of bush trees close by broke intohis reverie. He lifted his head sharply and looked around, then upwards.The stars had paled in the violet dome above him. Somewhere near, aheadof him, was a piece of ornamental water. He caught a glimpse of itbetween the trees.Pip-pip! came again from the robins throat. He remembered Charles Fox,and said softly aloud:    Came forward to be seen,    My little bright-eyed fellow,    And an honest one as well O    In thy suit of olive green,    With red-orange vest between,    And small touching voice so mellow.The bird suddenly flew across his path, dropped upon a low piece of ironfencing, glanced askance at him, then darted to where a morning mealpeeped out of the damp sod.Two or three other low, sleepy bird-notes followed, then the water-fowlbegan their discordant quacking. The tremulous flutenotes of a thrushmade rich music on the morning air.The stars faded out of sight. The cold grey light of dawning day movedinto the eastern horizon. The smell of the earth grew rank. The air grewkeener. The east slowly reddened. Roofs and towers of houses and churchesgrew up slowly, and grey amid the cold light of the dawn. He turned toface the spot where he knew the great clock-tower of Westminster couldbe seen. A light burned high aloft in the tower, telling that Englandslegislators were still in session.Slowly, thoughtfully, he turned back to walk home.If Christ came at this instant, he mused, how many of those Commonersand Peers would be ready to meet Him? And what of the teeming millions ofthis mighty city? God help us all! What blind fools we are!       *       *       *       *       *In spite of his night vigil Tom Hammond was in his office at his usualhour. He had been there about an hour when there came a short, sharp rapon the panel of his room-door. In response to his Come in! Joyce, thedrunken reporter lurched in. In some way he had contrived to elude thoseon duty in the enquiry-office.He was the worse for drink, and in response to Hammonds sharp queries:What do you want? How came you here unannounced? he began to beg theloan of five shillings.Not a copper! cried Hammond.Joyce whined for it.Hammond refused more sharply.The drunken wretch cringed, whimpered for just arf-a-crown.The fellow began to bluster, then to threaten.If you dont leave this room, Ill hurl you out, cried Hammond, andgive you in custody of the police.The drunken beast straightened his limp form as well as he was able, ashe hiccoughed:All rightsh, Tom Hamnd. Every dawg hash hish day. Youre havin yourshnow, all rightshall rightsh,but Illhicdo fur yer; Illhicruin yer;IllTom Hammond darted from his place by the table. The next instant he wouldhave put his threat of hurling out into execution, but the drunkenbraggart did not wait for him, for he shuffled out of the room, cursinghideously.As the door closed upon him, Tom Hammond went across to the window, andflung up the lower sashes, and drew down the upper ones. From a drawerin a cabinet he took a strip of scented joss-paper, and lit it. Thesandal-like perfume spread instantly through all the room.Faugh! he muttered. The whole place seems foul after his presence.He turned to his wash-stand, rolled back the polished top, and washed hishands.Ill see Ralph, he muttered, as he dried his hands and go out for acouple of hours. Ill go and see Cohen.It was curious how often he found excuse to visit the Jew.A quarter of an hour later he drove up to the house of Cohen. He foundhim, with his wife and Zillah, on the point of starting for theirsynagogue.One may live a life-time, as a Jew, in this country, Cohen explained,and never see the ceremony that is about to take place in our synagogue.It is what is known in our religion as Chalitza. Will you go with us,Mr. Hammond?Tom Hammonds eyes met Zillahs. Then he promptly saidYes to the Jews question.Right, then! We can explain about the ceremony as we go! Cohen said,and the quartette left the house.There was not much time for explanation, but what Tom Hammond heardconvinced him that he was a fortunate journalist that day. He had noopportunity of talking with Zillah, but he found his heart beating with astrange wildness whenever his eyes met hersand they frequently met.At the door of the synagogue the party had to separate, the two womengoing one way, Cohen and Hammond another. The building was filling veryfast. Presently it was packed to suffocation.It was Tom Hammonds first sight of a Jewish congregation in a synagogue.It amazed him. The hatted men and bewigged womenthese latter sat behinda grille. The gorgeousness of much of the female finery. The curiouspraying shawlsthe Talith of the men.Suddenly a Rabbi began to intone the opening words of the service,reading from the roll of the law, The Holy Scroll: If brethren dwelltogether, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the deadshall not marry without unto a stranger; her husbands brother shall takeher to wife, and perform the duty of a husbands brother to her.... Andif the man like not to take his brothers wife, then let his brotherswife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husbands brotherrefuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will notperform the duty of my husbands brother.Then the elder of the city shall call the man, and speak unto him: andif he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;Then shall his brothers wife come unto him in the presence of theelders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and shall spit in his face,and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that willnot build up his brothers house.And his name shall be called in Israel, the house of him that hath hisshoe loosed.The service was all very curious in the eyes of Tom Hammond. He followedevery item of it with the closest, most interested attention. Presentlythe parties specially concerned mounted the platform. This platform wasbacked with a huge square frame covered with black cloth. This was meantto symbolize mourning for the dead husband. Three tall candle-sticks heldlighted candles, their flames looking weird and sickly in the daylight.The Rabbi stooped before the brother-in-law, and took off his right shoeand sock. Another official washed the foot, wiped it with a towel, andpared the toe-nails.A soft white shoe, made specially for the occasion, was then taken by therabbi, put on to the bare foot of the man, and laced up very tightly, thelong ends of the lace being twisted round the ankle and knotted securely.Then there followed a seemingly interminable string of questions, put bythe rabbi, and answered by the brother-in-law. The catechism culminatedin a few chief questions such as:Do you wish to marry this woman?I do not, replied the brother-in-law.For what reason?I am already married; my wife is living, and the law of the land welive in does not permit my having more than one wife.The reply rang clear and strong through the silent building, and the hushseemed to deepen as the rabbi asked,Will you give this woman Chalitza?Certainly I will, if she wishes it, replied the brother-in-law.Turning to the woman, the rabbi asked, Do you wish to receive Chalitza?Tom Hammond saw how the light of a great eagerness leaped into the eyesof the beautiful Jewess, and how her face glowed with the warmth of asudden colour, as she replied,I do wish for Chalitza, for I desire to marry again.The rabbis assistant gave her certain instructions, and she knelt beforeher brother-in-law, and with the thumb and finger of her right handshedare not use the left, however difficult her task might prove,she beganuntying the knots in the lace fastenings around the ankle.It was no childs play to unfasten the shoe. The knots had been drawnvery tight; but she was very determined, and presently a deep sigh ofrelief broke from the breathless, watching congregation, as, taking theshoe from the mans foot, she flung it sharply down, twice, upon thefloor.She rose now to her feet to complete the ceremony. The law of spittingin the face of the man had been modified to meet the views of a day lessgross than when it was carried out in full coarseness.The brother-in-law took a couple of paces backwards, and the beautifulwidow spat on the place he had stood a moment before.Then she faced the great congregation. Her eyes travelled straight to theface of the man she loved, whom she was shortly to marry. Her eyes dancedwith excitement, her cheeks were rosy with colour, her whole face wasfull of an indescribable rapture, as she cried:I am free!True, sister, you are free! the brother-in-law responded.The rabbi moved swiftly to her side, and, looking into her face, said:O woman of Israel, you are free!With a shout that reminded Tom Hammond of the shout, He is risen!at the Easter service in the Greek churches of Russia, the excited,perspiring congregation cried: Woman, you are free!A moment or two later the service concluded, and the building emptied.Walking homeward by Hammonds side, Cohen said, Only the most orthodoxof Jews would dream of using Chalitza to free themselves for re-marrying.This is the only case I have personally known. By-the-bye, Mr. Hammond,it is said that about the middle of the eighteenth century that one ofthe Rothschild widows sought Chalitza, but failed to untie the lace ofthe shoe, and was disqualified from re-marrying.Cohens wife had stopped to speak to some friends. The young Jew joinedher. Tom Hammond found himself moving forward by Zillahs side.What an extraordinary service that was, Miss Robart! he said.It was! she glanced almost shyly away from him, for, unknown to himselfhis eyes were full of the warmest admiration.Do you think, Miss Robart, he went on, if you were situated as wasthat beautiful woman whom we have just seen freed from the Mosaic bond,that you would have braved the Chalitza ceremony, or would you have takenadvantage of the English law andShe lifted her great, black, lustrous eyes to his in a sudden gaze ofutter frankness, as, interrupting him, she cried:I would certainly not marry any man, save one whom I could wholly revereand love!Happy the man whom you shall thus honour, Miss Robart!Tom Hammond barely whispered the words, and she was not wholly sure thathe meant them for her ears. She did not respond in any way. But she wasconscious that his gaze was fixed upon her. She was equally consciousthat she was blushing furiously.Perhaps it was to give her a chance of recovering herself, that his nextquestion was on quite a different topic.Are you, Miss Robart, he said, wholly wedded to the Jewish faith? Doyou believe, for instance, that Jesus, the Nazarene, was an impostor?He heard the catch that came into her throat. Then, with ahalf-frightened look around, she lifted her melting eyes to his, as shesaid, I can trust you, Mr. Hammond, I know. You will keep my confidence,if I give it to you?His eyes answered her, and she went on.I have not dared to breathe a word of it to anyone, not even to my goodbrother-in-law Abraham, but I am learning to love the Christ.Her face was filled with a holy light, her cheeks glowed with excitement,as she went on:I see how the prophecies of our forefathersIsaiah especiallywere allliterally fulfilled in the life and work of Jesus of Nazareth. I see,too, that when next He comes, it will not be as our race supposes, as theMessiah to the Jews, but He will come in the air, andShe glanced sharply round. Some instinct told her her friends were coming.No more now, she whispered. I will tell you more another time. Ishall myself know more, to-night. I go twice a week to a mission-room atSpitalfieldsWhat time? he asked eagerly.Seven, she replied, not realizing the eagerness of his tone.Where is this place? he went on.She had just time to tell him. When Cohen and his wife came up, husbandand wife began talking together. Zillah appeared to listen, but inreality she heard nothing of what they were saying. For a strange thinghad happened.She had dropped her hand by her side as the Cohens had rejoined them, andhad suddenly found her fingers clasped in Hammonds hand.What did it mean? she wondered. They had met often of late. She had readan unmistakable ardency in his eyes very often, when her glance met his.And, deep in her own heart, she knew that all the woman-love she wouldever have to give a man she had unconsciously given to him. Was thissudden secret handclasp of his a silent expression of love on his part,or was it meant merely as an assurance of sympathy in the matter of hernew faith?She could not be sure which it was, but she let her plump fingers givea little pressure of response. How did he translate this response? shewondered. She had no means of deciding, save that her heart leaped wildlyin a tumultuous delight as she felt how he literally gripped her fingersin a closer, warmer clasp.They had reached the house by this time. Hammond would not go in. Heshook hands, in parting, with each, but his hold upon Zillahs hand waslonger than on the others. He pressed the fingers meaningly, and his eyesheld an ardency that gave a new tumult to her heart.As she passed into the house she whispered to herself, Will he be atSpitalfields to-night?CHAPTER XVIII.TOLD IN A CAB.A quarter of an hour before the time Zillah had given him, Tom Hammondwas waiting near the Mission Hall for Jews, where the meeting was to beheld. He was anxious that she should not know of his proximity, so keptout of sight,there were many possibilities of this among the variousstalls in the gutter-way.Presently he saw her coming, and the light of a glad admiration leapedinto his eyes. What a superb face and figure she has! he mused. What aperfect queen of a woman she is!From behind a whelk-stall he watched her cross over to the door of theHall. Here she paused a moment, and glanced around.I believe she half expected to see me somewhere near! he murmured tohimself.She entered the Hall. By the time her head was bowed in prayer, he hadentered, and had taken a seat on the last form, the fourth behind hers.When she first raised her head from her silent prayer, she looked aroundand backward. In her heart she was hoping he would be there. If he hadnot been bending in prayer, she must have seen him. After that she turnedno more, the service soon occupied all her thoughts.He too became utterly absorbed by the service, of which the addresswas the chief feature. It was largely expository, and from the firstutterance of the speaker, it riveted Tom Hammonds attention.The speaker, himself a converted Jew, took as his text Deut. xxi. 22, 23.If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and is sentenced todeath, and thou hang him on a tree, his corpse shall not remain all nightupon the tree, but, burying, thou shalt bury him on that day (because hewho is hanged is accursed of God).Now, brethren, the speaker went on, as far as I have been able todiscover, in all the Hebrew records I have been able to consult, and inall the histories of our race, I have not found a single reference to aHebrew official hanging of a criminal on a tree. To what, then, does thisverse refer, and why is it placed on Jehovahs statute-book?For a few moments he appealed to his Jewish hearers on points peculiarlyHebraic. Then presently he said,Now let us see if the New Testament will shed any light upon this.Turning rapidly the leaves of his Bible, he went on: There is a book inthe Christian Scriptures known as the Epistle to the Galatians which,in the tenth verse of the third chapter, repeats our own word fromDeuteronomy:Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are writtenin the Book of the Law to do them, and in the thirteenth verse says,Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a cursefor us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.We all, brethren, as the sons of Abraham, believe that our fatherDavids Psalm beginning, My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? wasnever written out of his own experience, but was prophetic of some otherPerson. Now, let me quote you some of the words of that Psalm.In clear, succinct language, the speaker, quoting verse after verse ofthe Psalm, showed how literally the descriptions fitted into a deathby crucifixion. Referring to the Gospel narratives of the death on thecross, he showed how they also fitted in with the description of Christsdeath, and how Christ actually took upon His dying lips the cry of thePsalm, My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?Then with wondrous clearness he referred to parts of Isaiah liii., and,continuing his theme, showed that it was evident that only one particulartype of death could have atoned for the sin of the human race, a deaththat would render the dying one accursed of the Almighty. The only deaththat would fully carry out that condition was crucifixion.Our race waited for the Messiah, he cried, and He came. Our prophetMicah said, Yet thou, O Bethlehem-Ephratah, little as thou art amidstthe thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall proceed from Me, One who isto be ruler in Israel!The Christ was born at the only time in the worlds history whenHe could have been executed on a treecrucified. At a time when theRomancrucifixion was a Roman punishmentswayed our beloved land ofJewry. So that Paul, the great Jew, chosen of God to be apostle to theGentiles, wrote after the crucifixion of Jesus, the Nazarene, Accordingto the time, Christ died.For some minutes the speaker appealed to his Jewish hearers with awonderful power. Then finally addressing not only the Jews, but anyGentiles who might be present, he cried:We must know the meaning of sin, brethren, before we can understandthe mystery of a crucified Christ. A beheaded, a stoned Christ, couldnot have atoned for a guilty world, but only a God-cursed death, atree-cursed death could have done this.And Christ was cursed for usHe who knew no curse of His own. Ah!beloved, the guilt of the human race is the key to the cross.Times change, customs change, but sin remains, sin is ever the same, andonly a living, personal trust in the crucified Christ can ever deliverthe unsaved sinner from the wrath of God which abideth on him.The address closed. Tom Hammond awoke from his intense absorption ofsoul. He had long since utterly forgotten Zillah. He had seen onlyhimself, at first, his own sin, and that his sin had nailed Christ to thecross. Then, better still, he saw the Christ.Only a few nights before he had paused to watch a Salvation Armyopen-air meeting. The girl-officer in charge of the corps had announcedthirty-eight as the number of the hymn they would sing, and prefaced thereading of the first verse by saying:This hymn was written by an ex-drunkardan ex-blasphemer. His name wasNewtondrunken Jack Newton, he was often called by his mates, and byothers who knew him. He was a sailor, on a ship trading to the Africancoast, at the time when his soul was aroused to its danger. He was inagony, not knowing what to do to get rest and peace.One night he was keeping anchor-watch. He was alone on the deck, thenight was dark and eerie. His sins troubled him. All that he had heardof the crucified Christwhom he had so often blasphemedswept into hissoul, and he groaned in the misery of his sin-convicted state.Suddenly he paused in his deck-pacing, and looked up. To his feveredimagination, the yard which crossed the mast high up above his headappeared like a mighty cross, and it was remembering this, with all thesoul-experience of that night, that in after years, when he became apreacher of the gospel, and a noted divine, Dr. John Newton wrote:    I saw One hanging on a tree      In agonies and blood,    Who fixed His dying eyes on me,      As near the cross I stood.    A second look He gave, which said,      I freely all forgive    My blood was for thy ransom paid,      I die that thou mayst live.Recalling these words now, Tom Hammonds soul received the greatRevelation. He heard no word of the closing hymn and prayer, but passedout into the open air a new man in Christ.The mission-leader had given an invitation to any who would like to behelped in soul matters to remain behind. Tom Hammond noticed that Zillahlingered.It was half-an-hour before she came out. Tom Hammond had lived alife-time of wonder in the thirty minutes.Like one in a delicious dream Zillah walked on a few yards. Suddenly shebecame aware of Tom Hammonds presence at her side.Zillah!He gave her no other word of greeting. It was the first time he had evercalled the young girl by her first name. He took her hand, and drew itthrough his arm. She barely noticed the tender action, for her soul wasrioting in a new-found joy, and she poured out, in a few sentences, allthe story of her supreme trust in Christ the Nazarene.His voice was hoarse with many emotions, as he said,I, too, Zillah, have to-night seen Jesus Christ dying for my sin, andhave taken Him for my own personal Saviour!Suddenly she realized how closely he was holding her to his side, howtight was the clasp of his hand upon hers. She looked up into his faceto express her joy at his new-found faith. Their eyes met. A new meaningflashed in their exchanged glances.A four-wheeled cab moved slowly along in the gutter-way, the driveruttered a low Keb, keb!Tom Hammond seized the opportune offer, and whispered,Let us take a cab, Zillah. I have something to say to you which I mustsay to-night.Before scarcely she realized it, she was seated by his side in the cab.There is a moment in every womans life when her heart warns her of thecoming of the great event in that life, when love is to be offered to herby the only man who has ever loomed large enough in her consciousness tobe able to affect her existence.This moment had suddenly unexpectedly come to Zillah Robart.Her heart warned her that the crisis was upon her. She had done nothingto precipitate it. It had met her, drawn her aside, and had shut her upin the semi-darkness of this vehicle with the only man she could everlove.The cab rattled over the cobbles of that wide East-end thoroughfare, pastthe throngs of moving pedestrians, though, to her consciousness, thewhole wide world consisted of but one manthe man at her side.He had secured her hand, he held it in his strong, hot clasp. She heldher breath in a strange, expectant ecstasy. Then the inevitable came. Shefelt its coming.Tom Hammond was drawing her closer to himself. She was yielding to thatdrawing. She caught her breath again, and as she did so a rush of strangetears filled her eyes.Zillah! his voice was hoarse and deep.She realized the meaning of the hoarseness. She knew by her own feelingthat the depth and intensity of his voice was due to the emotion thatfilled him. She knew she would have found herself voiceless at thatmoment had she tried to speak.I love you, my darling! he went on. I have loved you from the firstinstant I met you. You have felt it, known it, dear. Have you not?She tried to speak, her lips moved, but no sound came from them. But shelooked into his eyes, and he read his answer.With a sweeping gesture of passionate love he gathered her into his armsand showered kisses upon her lips, her cheeks, her forehead, her hair.She lay like a stunned thing in his arms. Her joy was almost greater thanshe could bear. Then as his hot lips sought hers again, she awoke fromher semi-trance of ecstasy, and with a little sob she flung her armsupwards and clasped them about his neck, crying,Love you, my darling? Love seems too poor a word to express my feeling,for God knows that, save my Lord Jesus, to whom to-night I have fullyyielded, you are all my life.Her voice was stifled with a little rush of tears. Where she lay on hisbreast, he felt how all her frame quivered.And you will be mine, dear Zillahand soon? His eyes burned into hers,asking for an answer as loudly as his lips.She did not answer him for a moment. Her heart beat with a tumultuousgladness, and her brain throbbed with the wonder of what she conceived tobe the honour that had come to her. Wondering incredulity mingled withthe rapturous ecstasy that filled her.But you are so greatso She paused, she could find no words toexpress all that prospective wifedom to him appeared to her.He smiled down into her eyes. Her loveliness seemed to him greater thanever before.You seem like a king to me! she gasped at last.You, Zillah, he smiled, do not seem, you are, a queen to me. Say,darling, the one word that shall fill all my soul with delightsay thatyou will be mineand soon, very soon!I will.There was the intensity of a mighty love in her utterance of the twowords.He gathered her to himself in an even closer embrace, and spent hiskisses on her lips.The flush of pride, of love, burned deeper in her face.Oh, why is it given to me to have such bliss? she murmured.The words were low-breathed; they sounded like a gasping sigh of delightmore than a voiced utterance.For a moment, clasped tightly in his arms, she was silent, and heuttered no word. Presently he whispered,Will it give you joy, I wonder, my darling, to know that I have beena man free of all womans love before? I have seen many women, in manylands, the loveliest of the earththough none so lovely as you, mysweetheart. It is no egotism on my part, either, to say that many womenhave sought my love by their smiles and favour. But none ever won a wordof love or response from me.The cab was passing a great central light in the heart of a junction offour roads. Her eyes, full of a great rapture, sought his. His were fixedupon her face, and filled with a love so great that again she caught herbreath in wonder.But you, my Zillah! He caught her close to himself again, and bendinghis head, let his lips cling to hers, But you, darling! he continued,have been to me all that the heart of man could ever wish for, from thefirst moment I met you. May God give us a long life together, dearest,and make us (with our new-born faith in Him) to be the best, the holiesthelp-meets, the one to the other, that this world has ever known.Where she lay in his arms, he felt her tremble with the intensity of herjoy. As he looked down into the deep, dreamy lustrousness of her eyes,he saw how they were full of a far-off look, as though she was picturingthat united future of which he had spoken.Perhaps he read that look in her eyes aright. Then, as he watched her, hesaw how the colour deepened in her face. She slowly, proudly, yet with aglad frankness, lifted herself in his arms until, in a tender, passionatecaress, her lips rested upon his in the first spontaneous kiss she hadgiven him.If the Christ, to whom we have given ourselves to-night, should tarry,she whispered, and we are spared to dwell together on earth as husbandand wife, dear Tom, may God answer all that prayer of yours abundantly.The cab turned a corner sharply at that moment. He looked through thewindow. They were within a few hundred yards of where he had given thedriver orders to stop. Zillah would have, on alighting, only the lengthof a short street to traverse before reaching home, and he would take ahansom and drive back to the office. But the intervening moments beforethey would part were very precious, and love took unlimited toll in thoseswift, fleeting moments.CHAPTER XIX.TOM HAMMOND REVIEWING.It was the morning after Tom Hammond had found Christ, and had closedwith the great offer of redemption. He had scarcely slept for the joy ofthe two loves that had so suddenly come into his life.During the sleepless hours, he had learned, for the first time in hislife, the true secret of prayer, and that even greater secret, that ofcommunion.With real prayer there is always a certain degree of communion, but real,deep, soul-filling communion is more often found in seasons when thecommuning one asks for nothing, but, silent before his or her God, thesense of the Divine fills all the being, and if the lips utter any soundit is the cry, My Lord and my God!Tom Hammond, reviewing all that God had revealed to him, learned in thosefirst hours of his new birth the secret of adoring communion with God.In the book of extracts he had been reading in the tube train at themoment when he had first heard of Major Hs coming address on theSecond Advent, he had come across one headed, Frederick William Faber:The Precious Bloodchap. iv. He had at the time been considerablyimpressed with the extract, though there was a certain note about itwhich he had failed to understand. In the flush of the great revelationthat had come to his soul (in that little meeting at Spitalfields), henow found the book, and re-read the extract:I was upon the sea-shore; and my heart filled with love it knew not why.Its happiness went out over the wide waters, and upon the unfetteredwind, and swelled up into the free dome of blue sky until it filled it.The dawn lighted up the faces of the ivory cliffs, which the sun and seahad been blanching for centuries of Gods unchanging love. The miles ofnoiseless sands seemed vast, as if they were the floors of eternity.Somehow, the daybreak was like eternity. The idea came over me of thatfeeling of acceptance which so entrances the soul just judged and justadmitted into heaven.To be saved! I said to myself, to be saved!Then the thoughts of all the things implied in salvation came in onethought upon me; and I said:This is the one grand joy of life; and I clapped my hands like achild, and spoke to God aloud. But then there came many thoughts, all inone thought, about the nature and manner of our salvation. To be savedwith such a salvation!This was a grander joy, the second grand joy of life; and I tried to saysome lines of a hymn but the words were choked in my throat. The ebb wassucking the sea down over the sand quite silently; and the cliffs werewhiter, and more day-like. Then there came many more thoughts all in onethought, and I stood still without intending it.To be saved by such a Saviour! This was the grandest joy of all, thethird grand joy of life; and it swallowed up the other joys; and after itthere could be on earth no higher joy.I said nothing; but I looked at the sinking sea as it reddened in themorning. Its great heart was throbbing in the calm; and methought I sawthe precious blood of Jesus in heaven, throbbing that hour with realhuman love of me.Yes, murmured Tom Hammond, after all, to be saved by such a Saviouris a greater, higher, holier thought than the mere knowledge that one issaved, or of the realization of what that salvation comprises.In every way that night was one never to be forgotten by Tom Hammond. Heneeded, too, all the strength born of his new communion with God to meetwhat awaited him with the coming of the new days daily papers.The paper whom whose staff he had been practically dismissed in our firstchapter (the editor of which was his bitterest enemy) had found how touse the glass stiletto.Some of the most scurrilous paragraphs ever penned appeared in hisenemys columns that morning. It is true that the identity of the manslandered (Tom Hammond) was veiled, but so thinlyso devilishlythatevery journalist, and a myriad other readers, would know against whom thescurrilous utterances were hurled.Tom Hammond would not have been human if the reading of the paragraphshad not hurt him. And he would not have been partaker of the Divinenature, as he now was, if he had not found a balm in the committal ofhis soreness to God.That is the work of that fellow Joyce, he told himself.Twenty-four hours before, if this utterance had had to have been made byhim, he would have said,That beast Joyce! But already, as a young soldier of Christ, thepromised watch was set upon his lips. In the strength of the two greatloves that had come into his lifethe love of Christ and the love ofZillah Robartthe scurrilous paragraphs affected him comparativelylittle.When he had skimmed the papers, attended to his correspondence, and toone or two other special items, he took pen and paper and began to writeto his betrothed.His pen flew over the smooth surface of the paper, but his thoughts wereeven quicker than his pen. His whole being palpitated with love. It wasthe love of his highest ideal. The love which he had sometimes dared tohope might some day be his, but which he had scarcely dared to expect.The memory of his passing fancy for Madge Finisterre crossed his mind,once, as he wrote. He paused with the pen poised in his fingers, andsmiled that he should ever have thought it possible that he was beginningto love her. I liked her, admired her, he mused. I enjoyed her frank,open friendship, but love herno, no. The word cannot be named in thesame breath as my feeling for Zillah.He put his pen to the paper again, and poured out all the wealth ofthe love of his heart to his beautiful betrothed. When he had finallyfinished the letter, he sent it by special messenger to Zillah.He had not forgotten that Major Hs second meeting was that day. Threeoclock found him again in the hall. This time it was quite full. Therewas a new sense of interest, of understanding, present within him as heentered the place. This time he bowed his head in real prayer.The preliminary proceedings were almost identically like those of theprevious occasion, except that the hymn sungthough equally new toHammondwas different to either of those sung at the first meeting. But,if anything, he was more struck by the words than he had been with thoseof the other hymns.And how rapturously the people sang:    Till He come! Oh, let the words    Linger on the trembling chords;    Let the little while between    In their golden light be seen;    Let us think how heaven and home    Lie beyond that Till He come!This time a lady, a returned Chinese missionary, led prayer, and then themajor resumed his subject.We saw, dear friends, at our last meeting, the grand oldsoldier-preacher began, what were some of the prophesied signs of ourLords second coming and how literally these signs were being fulfilledin our midst to-day. This afternoon, God willing, and time permitting, Iwant us to see how He will come; what will happen to the believer; andalso what effect the expectancy of His coming should have upon us, asbelievers.First of all, how will He come? While Jesus, who had led His disciplesout of the city, was in the act of blessing them, He suddenly rosebefore their eyes, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. Haveyou ever thought of this fact, beloved, that the cloud itself was amiracle? Whoever heard of a cloud at that special period of the year, inPalestine? And I very much doubt if anyone, save the apostles, in all thecountry round about, saw that cloud. If you ask me what I think the cloudwas, I should be inclined to refer you to the 24th Psalm, and say thatthe cloud was composed of the angel-convoy, who, like a guard of honour,escorted the Lord back to glory, crying, as they neared the gates of thecelestial city, Lift up your heads, oh, ye gates, and let the King ofGlory come in!He went away in a cloud. The angels, addressing the amazed disciplesdeclared to them that He would so come in like manner as ye have seenHim go.It may be that to the letter that will be fulfilled, and that our Lordsreturn for His Church will be in an actual cloud. I think it is probableit will. Anyway, we know that He will come in the air, for Paul, towhom was given, by God, the privilege of revealing to His Church thegreat mystery of the second coming of our Lord, and who said, in thisconnection:Behold, I show you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall allbe changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when writing moreexplicitly to the church at Thessalonica, said:For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which arealive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them whichare asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the deadin Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall becaught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air;and so shall ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another withthese words.Now, beloved, can any words be plainer, simpler, than these of Pauls,forming, as they do, the climax to all that has gone before in the NewTestament. Jesus had Himself said,I will come again and receive you unto Myself.The angels said,In like manner as ye have seen Him go, He shall come again, and nowPaul amplifies this manner of His coming, while, at the same time, heemphasizes the fact of that return.Now let us look, dear friends, at the separate items of that detailedcoming. We have already, more than once, alluded to the secrecy of thereturn of our Lord for His people, and people are puzzled over thelanguage used by Pauls description of the return. The Lord shall comewith a shout. Then the world at large will hear Him coming? No; we thinknot. Or, if they hear a sound, they will not understand it.The Lords voice in His spiritual revelations is never heard save by theLords people. But there is the voice of the archangelhow about that?The same rule applies to that, we think.There were godly shepherds watching their flocks at night, nearBethlehem, and there was a whole host of angels singing, but theBethlehemites did not hear. No one appears to have heard or seen anythingsave the godly shepherds. The same, we believe, applies to the trump,the call of God.In this connection it is interesting to note a fact that probably wasin the mind of Paul when he wrote thus to the Thessalonians. The Romanarmy used three special trumpet-calls in connection with departurewithmarching.The first meant, Pull down tents.The second, Get in array.The third, Start.Did Paul, moved by the Holy Ghost, translate these three clarion notesin the topic of 1 Thess. iv. 16, after this fashion:1. The Lord Himself.2. Voice of the archangel.3. The trump of God.But leaving that, again I would emphasize this truth, that it is onlythe trained ear of the spiritually-awakened soul which ever hears thecall of God. We believe that all Scripture teaches the secrecy as well asthe suddenness of the rapture of the church.In all the many appearances of the risen, resurrected Lord Jesus, duringthe many weeks between the resurrection and the ascension, even though,on one occasion, at least, He was seen by 500 disciples at once, yetthere is no hint, either in the Word of God or in the records of historyof that time, that Jesus was ever seen by the eye of an unbeliever. Anddepend upon it, no eye will see, no ear will hear Him, when He comesagain, save those who are in Christ.The world seeth Me no more our Lord said, but ye see Me. Him Godraised up the third day, and gave Him to be made manifest, not to all thepeople, but unto witnesses that were chosen before God, even to us whodid eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead.When the voice of the Father came from heaven, witnessing to Jesustruth, the people that stood by failed to hear it as a voice, butexclaimed,It thunders. In the case of Paul on the way to Damascus,those with him heard nothing understandable.Enoch was taken secretly. Noah was shut into the ark before the floodcame. Only Israel, at Sinai, and not the surrounding nations, understoodthose awful physical manifestations of Gods power. Elijah was takensecretly. The nation neither saw nor heard anything of it.When will He come? I do not know; no one knows exactly; but this we doknow, from the Word of Godthat nothing remains to be fulfilled beforeHe comes. He may come before this meeting closes. Again we know by everysign of the times that His coming can not now be delayed much longer.Now to a very important feature as to the truth of the second coming ofthe Lord. There are many who argue that such teaching will tend to makethe Christian worker careless of his work, his life, etc. There was nevera more foolish argument advanced.First take a concrete illustration that gives the flat denial toitnamely, that the most spiritual-minded workers, at home and abroad,are those whose hearts (not heads only) are saturated with, not thedoctrine merely, but the expectancy of their Lords near return. Then,too, every such worker finds an incentive to redoubled service in theremembrance that every soul saved through their instrumentality bringsthe Lords return nearerhasting His comingsince, when the last unitcomposing His Church has been gathered in, He will come.Scripture, dear friends, is most plain, most emphatic, in its statementsthat the effect of living in momentary expectancy of our Lords returntouches the spiritual life and service at every point. We know, wroteJohn, that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall seeHim as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,even as He is pure. That, beloved, is the general statement. Now let uslook at some of the separate particular statements.Writing to the Philippians, Paul connects heavenly mindedness with thereturn of the Lord for His Church saying, For our conversationourmanner of living, our citizenshipis in heaven; from whence also welook for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. To the Colossians thegreat apostle showed how the coming of the Lord was to be the incentiveto mortification of self. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,then shall ye also appear with Him in glory. Mortify, therefore, yourmembers which are upon the earth, etc. James taught that the real curefor impatience was this dwelling in the hope and expectancy of our Lordscoming again. Be ye also patient, he wrote; stablish your hearts; forthe coming of the Lord draweth nigh! We live in an age which is cursedwith impatiencechildren, young men and women, parents, business people,domestic people, pastors, Christian workers, Sunday-school teachers, allalike have their spiritual lives and their work marred by impatience. Areal, moment-by-moment heart-apprehension of the possible coming of Jesusin the next moment of time, is the only real cure for this universalimpatience in the Christian Church.Then take another great sin in the Church, belovedcensoriousness. Oh,the damage it does to the one who indulges in it, and the suffering itcauses to the one who is the victim of it. But here, again, a full,a constant realization of the near coming of our Lord will checkcensoriousness. Writing to the Corinthians, in his first epistle, Paulsays, Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, whoboth will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifestthe counsels of the hearts.The great quickener, too, of Christian diligence is to be found in thecoming of the Lord. Peter writes to us saying, But the day of the Lordwill come as a thief in the night, ... seeing then that these thingsshall be, ... what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy livingand godliness; looking for and hasting the coming.... Wherefore, beloved,seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found ofHim in peace, without spot, and blameless.May I say, too, in all gentleness and love, that it has seemed to me,for years, that the missing link in nearly all holiness preaching (socalled) is this much-neglected expectancy of our Lords return. Paulconnects holiness and the second coming of Christ, in his first epistleto the Thessalonians, saying, The God of peace sanctify you wholly; andI pray God your spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless unto thecoming of our Lord Jesus Christ.The scoff of the world, dear friends, against us, as Christians, is thatthe professed bond of love is absent from our life. And here again GodsWord shows us that a real living in expectancy of our Lords return wouldteach us to love one another. In that same epistle I have just quoted,Paul says, The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towardanother, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end He maystablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father,at the coming of our Lord with all His saints.I have only time, this afternoon, for but one more of these references,and that is a very elementary though a very essential one. Paul, in thatsame epistle, teaches that to be saved means that we are saved to serve.Ye turned to God, he says, to serve ... and to wait for His Son fromheaven.I must close, friends. But before I do, do let me beseech everyChristian here this afternoon to go aside with God, and with His plain,unadulterated Word. Assure yourself that Jesus is coming again, that Heis coming soon, and that you are so living that you shall not be ashamedat His coming. Should He tarry till Thursday next, and He is willing tosuffer me to meet you here again, we will continue this great subject onthe line of the three judgments. Let us close our meeting by singing hymnnumber 308.Like one in a strange, delicious dream, Tom Hammond rose with the othersand sang:    Jesus is coming! Sing the glad word!    Coming for those He redeemed by His blood,    Coming to reign as the glorified Lord!            Jesus is coming again!As he left the hall, and thought, How Zillah would have enjoyed, how shewould have been helped, by this meeting! he muttered.How senseless of me not to have told her of it when I wrote thismorning.He smiled a little to himself as he murmured:May I take this bit of remissness as a sign that the Divine love waspredominant within me, rather than the human? Or was it that I am not yetsufficiently taught in the school of human love?CHAPTER XIXa.MY MENTOR.It was about the hour that Tom Hammond entered the Hall to listen to theMajors second address. Cohen, the Jew, was in his workshop, his brainbusy with many problems, while his hands wrought out that wondrous Templework.The door opened, quietly, and Zillah entered. She often came for atalk with him at this hour, as she was mostly sure of an uninterruptedconversation. Her sister, to a large extent, lived to eat, and alwaysslept for a couple hours or more after her hearty two oclock dinner.The young Jew gave the beautiful girl a pleasant greeting. Then, afterthe exchange of a few very general words, the pair were silent. Zillahbroke the silence at last.Abraham, she began, I want to talk to you ononwellIve somethingimportant to say.He eyed her curiously, a tender little smile moving about among the linesof his mouth. There was a new note in her voice, a new light in her eyes.He had caught glimpses of both when they had met at breakfast, and againat dinner, but both were more marked than ever now.He had laid down his tool at her first word of address. Now she laid oneof her pretty plump hands on his, as she went on:You could not have been kinder, truer, dear Abraham, if you had been myown brother, _after the flesh_. I have looked upon you _as_ a brother, asa friend, as a protector, and I have always felt that I could, and wouldmake a confidant of you, should the needs-be ever arise.The gentle smile in his eyes as well as his mouth encouraged her, and shewent on:A gentleman has asked me to marry him, AbrahamCohen gave a quick little start, but in her eagerness she did not noticeit.I have promised, she continued, for I love him, and he loves me asonlyWho is he, Zillah?Mr. Hammond, dear!His eyes flashed with the mildest surprise. But, to her astonishment, shenoticed that he showed no anger.In spite of all his usual gentleness she had half expected a littleoutburst, for to marry _out_ of the Jewish faith, was equal in shamealmost to turning Meshumed, and usually brought down the curse of onesnearest and dearest.He is of the Gentile race, Zillah! Cohen said quietly.She noticed that he said _race_, and not _faith_, and she unconsciouslytook courage from the fact.She was silent for a moment. Her lips moved slightly, but no sound camefrom her. Watching her, he wondered. She was praying!Suddenly she lifted her head, proudly almost. She suffered her greatlustrous eyes,liquid in their love-lightto meet his, as she said, witha ringing frankness:Abraham! I have found the Messiah! He whom the Gentiles call the Christ;The man-God, Jesus, _is_ the Messiah!His eyes dwelt fixedly upon her face. She wondered that there was neitheranger nor indignation in them.May I tell you why I think, why I _know_ He is the Messiah, Abraham?she asked.Do, Zillah!He spoke very gently, and she wondered more and more. She made no remark,however, on his toleration, but began to pour out her soul in the wordsof the Old Testament scriptures, connecting them with their fulfillmentin the New Testament.Cohen, watching her, thought of Deborah, for all her beautiful formseemed suddenly ennobled under the power of the theme that fired her.Now I know, dear Abraham, she presently cried, How it is that Jehovahis allowing our Rabbisyou told me, you know, the other day, of the oneat Safedto be led to dates that prove that Messiah is coming soon? _Now_I know why God has allowed our nation to be stirred up,the Zionistmovement, the colonization of Jerusalem and its neighbourhood, and allelse of this likeyes, it is because the Christ _is_ coming.Only, dear brother, it is not as the Messiah of the Jews that He comessoonHe came thus more than 1,900 years agothis time, when He comes, Hewill come for His church, His redeemed onesJew and Gentile alike whoare washed in His blood that was shed on Calvary for all the human race.For He was surely _Gods_ Lamb, and was slain at the Great, the last realPassover, dear Abraham, if only we allour racecould see this. What theblood of that first Passover lamb, in Egypt, was in type, to our peoplein their bondage and Blood-deliverance, so Jesus was in reality.Moses, of old, wist not how his face shone. And this lovely Jewishmaiden, as she talked of her Lord, wist not how all her lovely facewas transformed as she talked_glorified_ would not be too strong adescription of the change her theme had wrought in her countenance.And now, dear Abraham, she went on, that same Jesus has not onlyblotted out all my sin, for His names sake, but he bids me look forHim to come again. When _next_ He comesit may be before even this dayclosesCohen shot a quick, puzzled glance at her. She did not notice it but wenton:I have learned many things from the scriptures since I have been goingto the little Room at Spitalfields, and from the _Word_ of Jehovah,Himself, I have learned that Jesus may now come at any moment.He will come _in the air_, and will catch away all His believingchildren. Then, as the teachers show from the _Word_ of God, when thechurch is gone, there shall arise a terrible power, a man who will beSatans great agent to lead the whole world astray_Anti_christ, theWord of God calls himthen, during a period, probably about seven yearsaltogether, there shall be an ever growing persecution of those who shallwitness boldly for Jesus, and_Who_ will _they_ be, Zillah, he interrupted, if all the Church, asyou say, will be taken out of the world at the coming of Christ?One of the teachers, the other night, Abraham, she replied, said, thatthe natural consequence of the sudden taking away of the Believers fromthis earth would probably be, at first, a mighty revival, a turning toGod. If this be so, then these converts will be the witnesses to Jesusduring the awful seven years, which the Word of God calls The GreatTribulation.Then too, one of the teachers at the Room said, it is possible thatnot all Christians will be caught up in the air at the coming again ofJesus, but _only_ those faithful ones who are found watching, expectingHis coming. If that be soand no one dare dogmatise about so sacred andsolemn a thingthen there will be thousands of Christians left behind whowill have to pass through the awful time of Antichrists Tribulation.Her face glowed with holy light, as inspired by the thought in her soul,she went on:At first, dear Abraham, our own race will return to Jerusalem, and toall the land of our Father, still believing in the coming of the Messiah.The templethat wondrous Temple for which you are workingwill be rearedto Jehovah. The morning and evening sacrifices will be resumed. Thenpresently the Antichrist will make our people believe that he is theMessiah. Pretending to be Israels friend and protector he will deceivethem at first, but, by and by, he will try to force idolatry upon them,he will want to set up in our glorious Temple, (which will have beenreared to Jehovah,) an idol, an abomination.The teacher whom I have heard, Abraham,and many of them are of our ownracesee from scripture that the great mass of our people, in the land ofour fathers, will blindly accept this hideous idol worship.But Jehovah will not let Antichrist have all his own way. Jesus, withall those who were caught up with Him into the air, will come to thedeliverance of our people. He will come, _this_ time, to the earth. Hewill fight against Antichrist, will overcome him, His feet shall stand onthe Mount of Olives.Our poor deluded, suffering people will see Him, as our own prophetshave said:_I will pour out upon the House of David and upon theinhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication, ANDTHEY SHALL LOOK UPON ME WHOM THEY HAVE PIERCED, AND THEY SHALL MOURN FORHIM, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness forHim, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born_.She paused abruptly, struck by Cohens quietude of manner, where she hadexpected a storm. Gazing up wonderingly into his face she cried:Abraham, why are you thus quiet? Why have you not cursed me for aMeshumed, dear? Can it be that you, too, know aught of these glorioustruths?There was sadness and kindness in his eyes as he returned her pleadingglance. But there was no trace of anger.I wonder why, little sister, he began, I am not angry, as the men ofIsraels faith usually are with a Meshumed, even though the defaultershould be as beautiful as Zillah Robart?His glance grew kinder, as he went on:I began to wonder where mylittle sister went, twice a week, in the evenings, and, anxious abouther, lest she, in her innocence of heart and ignorance of life, shouldget into trouble, I followed her one night, and saw that she entered ahall, which I knew to be a preaching-place for Jews.Zillahs eyes were very wide with wonder. But she did not interrupt him.I did not enter the place myself, he went on, but that very firstnight, while waiting about for a few minutes, I met an old friend, aJew like myself, by _race_, but a Christian by faith. He talked withme, pointed to _our_ scriptures, quoted from the Gentile New Testament,showed, from them, how, in every detail, the birth, the life, the deathof Jesus, the Nazarene, fulfilled the prophecies of our father, andAnd you, Abraham Zillah laid her hand on the Jews wrist, in a swiftgesture of excitement, you, dear, she cried, see that Jesus was theMessiah?Slowly, almost sorrowfully it seemed to the eager girl, he shook his head.I cannot say all that, Zillah, he went on, I sat in a seat, lastnight, in that Hall, where I could see you and Hammond, where I couldhear all that was said upon the platform, but where I knew that neitheryou nor Hammond would be able to see me. All that I heard, last night,dear, has more than half convinced me, butwell, I cannot rush throughthis matter, I have to remember that it has to do with the life beyond,as well as this life.He sighed a little wearily.I saw the meeting between Hammond and you, Zillah, he went on. I hadbefore begun to scent something of Hammonds probable feeling for you,and I had seen you look at him in a way that, though you did not yourselfprobably realize it, meant, I knew, a growing feeling for him warmerthan our maidens usually bestow on a Gentile. I saw you enter the cabtogether, and drive off, andHe sighed again. Then without finishing his sentence, he said:Perhaps I shall see with you, Zillah, soon. Meanwhile, dearHe lifted his hands, let them rest upon her head, and softly, reverently,cried:The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine uponthee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His countenance uponthee, and give thee peace.The sweet old Nazarite blessing never fell more tenderly upon human earsthan it did upon Zillah Robart. Jehovah _had_ been very gracious to her.She had feared anger, indignation from her brother-in-law, she receivedblessing instead.As he slowly lifted his hands from her head, she caught them in hers,lifted them to her lips, and kissed them gratefully.May that blessing fall back upon your own head, upon your heart, yourlife, dear Abraham? she cried.Still holding his hands, she lifted her head. An eager light filled allher face, as she added:It wants but a few days to Passover, dear, I shall pray God that Hewill reveal Jesus fully to you before that!She dropped his hands, and made for the door. I hear the children fromschool, she cried. Then she was gone.Cohen did not turn to his work. But taking a New Testament from hispocket, began to study anew the Passion of Jesus, as recorded in theGospels.CHAPTER XX.THE PLACARD.Riding back to his office from that meeting Tom Hammond askedhimself:Ought I to begin to make this near Return of our Lord for Hischurch, the subject of my Prophets Chamber Column for to-morrowsissue?I must seek special guidance about this, he presently decided.The cab was nearing the office when he suddenly murmured:HE might come_to-day_!Even as he murmured the words his eyes seemed to see a striking way ofexhibiting his new-found faith in the Return of his Lord, and he came toa rapid decision.Lifting the flap in the roof of the cab, he told the driver to go on toa certain Sign and Ticket writers. Arrived at the place, he explainedto the writer that he wanted a card three feet six inches long,proportionate in width, very _boldly_, handsomely written with just thetwo words upon it, in the order of his sketch.He had taken an odd piece of card from the mans scrap heap, and with hispencil he drew out his idea, thus:                              +------------+                              |   TO-DAY?  |                              |  PERHAPS!  |                              +------------+How soon can I have it? he asked.In a couple of hours, sir!Pack it carefully and I will send a messenger for it!Hammond was turning from the counter, when the man said:I beg your pardon, sir, but if it is not too bold a question, may I askwhat the two words mean?They mean, smiled Tom Hammond, that Jesus Christ, Gods son, may comesuddenly to-day, before even you have time to finish the work upon myorder!The mans face wore a puzzled look. Then suddenly it brightened a little,as he said:Ah! I sees, its somethink religious. That aint in my line, not a bit,sir. I aint built that way. Now, my misses is! Shes the best wife a manever had, I cant find a speck o fault wi her, but, there it is, yerknow, shes gone, fair gone, sir, on religious things!Do you love her? Would you like to lose her? asked Hammond.Like to lose her, sir? why, no, sir! I believes I shouldI shouldwell Idont know what I should do, if she wur took!There was a note of deep gravity in Tom Hammonds voice, as he said:Then let that motto warn you, as you prepare to write it, that evenbefore you can finish it, the Christ who is to come again, who _will_surely come now very soon, may come. Then, when you go to look for yourwife, when you are perhaps expecting her to call you to your tea, shewill be missing. You will call her, search for her, yet never find her.Because, if she is a true child of God, she, with all _true_ Christians,will have been snatched away unseen from the world, caught up to meettheir Lord in the air.Good gracious, sir! yer give me the creeps! gasped the man.Seek ye the Lordyour good wifes Lord,while He may be found, myfriend. With this parting word Tom Hammond left the shop.Two hours and a half later the splendid bit of sign writing hung upon thewall of Hammonds room.It was a most striking placard. The first letter of each word nearlyeight inches in length, and in brilliant crimson, the other letters sixinches long in deep, purple black.As he sat back and regarded it where it hung, Tom Hammond mused on allthat he had heard that afternoon, of the effects upon the lives of thosewho possessed a real heart apprehension of the truth of the near Returnof the Lord.One can scarcely conceive, he murmured, what London, what all thecivilized, and so-called Christian world, would be like, if every manand woman, who _professes_ to be a christian, lived in the light of thetruth that the Lords return was near, was imminent. Every man (he wasrecalling the truth quoted that afternoon), _Who hath this Hope in him,purifieth himself even as He (Jesus) is pure._The rest of the day was a busy one. Many callers came in. Everyonenoticed the strange placard. Some asked what it meant. Modestly, but withstrong purpose, and with perfect frankness, Hammond told each and all whoenquired, of his change of heart, and how possessed with the fact thatChrists return was imminent, he had had the placard done for his own,and for others quickening and reminder.People smiled indulgently, but entered into no argument with him. He wastoo important a man for that, and, equally, they dare not _pooh-pooh_ histestimony, wild as it appeared to most, if not all of them.CHAPTER XXI.WAS HE MAD?Madge, a wife of barely eighteen hours, found her husbands church packedin every nook and corner when she entered it on the Sunday morning.The news of her sudden return, and equally sudden marriage, had helped tofill the church, though the knowledge that the Rev. Doig was to preachwould, in itself, have been sufficient to have gathered an unusuallylarge congregation.During the pastors sickness the pulpit had been supplied by various goodmen, secured by the deacons from all over the county. Doig had preachedtwice before, and was already a great favourite with the people.The pastor had not been well enough to be present at any service for manyweeks, and as he entered the church this morning, leaning heavily uponhis wifes arm, he received quite an ovation from the people.In spite of the curiosity and excitement over Madges appearance, thecongregation speedily settled down to quiet worship. There was somethingsubducing, quieting in the preachers manner. Just before the address,the people sang:    Lo! God is here! let us adore,      And own how dreadful is this place!    Let all within us feel His power,      And silent bow before His face;    Who know His power, His grace who prove,    Serve Him with awe, with reverence, love.With the singing of this hymn a deep, deep solemnity came down upon theassembly. It deepened as the preacher unfolded the wonders of the Biblerevelation relating to the Lords second coming.Madge forgot her husband, as, absorbed by the wonder of the revelation,she drank in the glorious truth. Had she been more alert in watching thepastor, she would have seen how restless he grew! How angrily his eyesflashed! How scowling his beetling brows became.Some of the people noticed their pastors evident displeasure, and so didone or two of the deacons. But no one dreamed that he would dare to utterany dissent to the service.Was he mad? Perhaps he was, for the time, as many men and women become,who nurse a groundless, senseless anger and jealousy! He was jealous ofthis mans hold upon the people. He had not dreamed that any man couldhold his congregation, as this man was holding them. He was angry, too,at the doctrine preached.With a startling suddenness he leaped to his feet, forgetting hisweakness, as he cried:I will not have that lying, senseless nonsenseworse thannonsensepreached in _my_ church, Mr. Doig. You will either announceanother text, and take a different subject, sir, or you must cease topreach!A slight flush rose into the cheeks of the preacher, as he half turned tothe pastor, and in low, but firm voice, heard everywhere amid the suddenstrained silence, he said:Dear Pastor, if you insist, (you have the _legal_ right to do so, as_pastor_ of this church, I suppose) I will desist. But I cannot, if Ipreach on, do other than declare all that God would have me do. Why,even as we are here, our Loving Lord may come, and if I faltered in mytestimony I should have to meet Him ashamedlyandRot! muttered the pastor. The word was heard by everyone, and a murmurof strong dissent ran through the place.With a white angry face, and flashing savage eyes, the Pastor walkedto the table, and leant upon it heavily in his weakness, as he criedhoarsely, This service is now concluded. While I hold the pastorate, nosuch sentimental rubbish, as Mr. Doig seems bent upon giving us, shall bevoiced from this platform.One of the deacons protested. The pastor was firm. Passion had renderedhim temporarily irresponsible. Another of the deacons, who had beenconferring with Doigwho had whispered the facts of the pastors evidenttemporary irresponsibilitynow urged the people to disperse quietly.Doig walked down to his host, and whispered, if I go at once, it willhelp matters. The pair then left the church. The congregation followedquickly. The deacons remained behind to confer together over thesituation, which was of a hitherto unheard of character.       *       *       *       *       *The pastor had left by the side door, and leaning more heavily than everupon Madge, they made their way to the house of Thaddeus Finisterre,Madges father. They were staying there. They took a private way,by which they were spared the unpleasantness of meeting any of thecongregation.Four minutes took them to the house. Neither of them spoke during thebrief journey. For the first time in her life Madge knew what it wasto feel the touch of fear. She had married the man by her side knowingcomparatively little of his real character and temperament.There may be insanity in his family, she mused, as she walked by hisside. She had already told herself that nothing but a temporary touch ofmadness could have led to his outburst in the church.Arrived at the house, the pastor went straight to his room, this gaveMadge an opportunity to confer with her father and mother a moment.His long anxious illness has unsettled his brain a little! the mothersaid. The best thing will be to take no notice, let us all be ascheerful, as much like our ordinary selves, as we can. Then, if we canpersuade him to go away to-morrow, I guess the best thing for you to do,Madge, will be to get a good doctor to examine him, and to prescribe forhim.The dinner-meal which followed, presently, was fairly free of constraint.After dinner Mr. and Mrs. Finisterre slipped away and left the husbandand wife to themselves.Almost immediately the pair were left, the pastor began to abuse thepreacher of the morning, and to denounce the teaching of the Lordssecond coming.But, my dear, cried Madge, it is evidently almost the most prominentdoctrine in the New Testament. There are more direct references to it inthe New Testament, Mr. Doig said, than to any other revealed doctrine.But its not _my_ doctrine, snapped the pastor, not the doctrine of_our_ church. It was scoffed at at our college, when _I_ was a student,andandMadge gazed wonderingly at him. His argument seemed so puerile, if notactually sinful.But, she cried, I dont see how that argument holds. To me, itsounds like blasphemy, almost, to say _I_, as a _minister_, and _we_as a _church_, will not preach the most prominent doctrine of the NewTestament, because of the foolish abuse of the teaching by here and therea wild visionary who lets his fancy and whim run away with his judgment.Suppose, dear Homer, some church or minister should say, We wont preachthe doctrine of the Atonement, would that save them from the charge ofblasphemy, when God says:If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the HolyCity, and from the things which are written in his Book.The pastor gazed at her in amazement. Her fashion of putting the mattergave him small opportunity of replying, so he took refuge in the coarsesneer:Have you turned _Doigite_?With a quick flush in her cheeks, and sudden flashing of eye, Madgereplied:If by that you mean, do I see, and have I accepted the revelation ofthe Word of God, as to the near coming of Christ, then I say _yes_. Iam _not_ a Doigite, but I am, thank God, a Christian! A very young one,a very poor and inexperienced one, tis true, but still I am one, and amdesirous to live to the Lord to whom I have given myself, and, after allI heard from the preacher this morning, I am more than ever determined toserve Christ wholly, and I can quite see how this wondrous _fact_ of thenear Return of our Lord will be a new and mighty force to revolutionizeall my life.An ugly snarl curled the lips of the amazed, discomfited pastor, and hewas just beginning a cruel little speech, when one of the Deacons wasannounced.Madge left the two men alone. As she passed on to her own room there wasa terrible pain at her heart, for the hideous thought came to her:CanHomer be truly converted? If he is, how can it be that he flatly refusesto believe what God has so plainly revealed?CHAPTER XXII.FROM THE PROPHETS CHAMBER.Tom Hammond was alone in his editorial office. He had come to the day,the moment at last, when he felt constrained to write out of his fullheart, to the readers of his paper, all that he yearned that the worldshould know of the imminence of the Return of the Lord.Before he put pen to paper to write on this supreme theme in hisProphets Chamber column, he bowed his head on his desk and prayed forguidance and help. Then he began to write out his heart fully, tellingfirst of his conversion, and of the wondrous meetings conducted by MajorH.His whole being was fired with holy purpose. Had ever a preacher such apulpit as has the editor of The Courier? he wrote. Had any preacherever so mighty a privilege, so great a responsibility as is mine to-day?This paper circulates through more than a million peoples hands, evenallowing that only the one person purchasing the paper, reads itthoughone might almost safely double that million, since there are very few ofthe papers which will not be read by _two_, or more persons.This Prophets Column will likely overflow all its ordinary banks, asdoes the Great Nile in its season, but if my overflowing but carry lifeon its tide, as does the tide of the overflowing Nile, then, all will bewell.As a converted Editor of a great daily, I have put my hand, my pen, mymind into the mighty, unerring hand of God, praying that I may writeonly that which will reach the _hearts_ of my readers. And the questioncomes to me, what word does London, does England most need to-day?Thisthat all the world should know, and realize, that any day, aye, anyhour, Christ may returnnot to the earth but _into the air_Here followed the teaching of the Gospel and Epistles, as he had learnedit from Major H, and from his own subsequent personal study of the Wordof God.I appeal to the most thoughtful of my readers, I appeal to theunthinking, as I say, do you not see how a real belief, in this nearcoming of Christ would revolutionize all our national, commercial,domestic, and church life. How, too, it would immediately settle everysocial problem.If our legislators, sitting in council at St. Stephens, realized thatbefore the present Parliamentary session could end in the ordinary way,that Christ might come, what a speedy end they would seek to put to everynational iniquity.The hideous drink traffic would be swept, root and branch, from ourland. And, in sweeping that curse away, the awful problem of theunemployed, the homeless, the starving, all that inures to our nationalpoverty would be swept away.The shameful opium traffic with China; the national Greed for territory;the Traffic in White Slaves; and every other national iniquity would beabolished.Christian churches, (so-called) would become worthy of the name_Christian_. All those bits of devilish device used to extract, andextort money from the pockets of the people would end, as by magic.Theatricals would be left to the theatres; nigger entertainments wouldbe left to the music-halls; the church would leave all these things totheir master_the Devil_.In _social_ life, people would pay their debts; the wild, mad, sinfulextravagance that marks the life of to-day, would cease. Christianswould love one another. Every Evangelical denomination would be_inter_-denominational in the truest sense, and be _one_ wholly in theirCrucified, Risen, coming Lord. A love for the poor fallen world, suchas has never been since our Lord spent Himself in service, would be theorder of the day, and not the vision of a few. Every missionary societywould have more men and women and money than they actually needed.But, even as I pen this millennium-like picture, I know, from the Wordof God, that it _cannot_ be _before_ Christ comes. But I seek to arouseevery _Christian_ to Gods call to them on this matter. You, who professto be Christs, dare not refuse this truth, save at the peril of losingthe _Crown_ of Life.The vast bulk of the churches, I know, preach, that the world willcontinually improve until the earth shall be fit for Christ to comeand reign. But I defy any cleric or layman to show me a single wordof scripture that gives the faintest colour to that belief, orstatementunless the person wrests the passage so advanced from itsdistinctly marked _dispensational_ setting.Things (spiritual) are growing worse and worse. There is a wholesaledown-gradeism, too awful to contemplate. Priest and people have erredalike! I take up the official organ of a section of the church thathas ever been regarded as the most out-an-out, in all that pertains toEvangelical truth, and I find its great head saying The Bible is _not_the sole spiritual guide for the christian, for, practically, the Bibleis a _dead_ book!The chief leader-writer of that same paperhimself usually regardedas the soundest of Believers, the most trenchant of all Evangelicalpreachers, writes in one of a series of articles, That the so-called_Finished work_ of Christ, is a doctrine not to be found in scripture,and glories in the fact that _we_ never have, and, I trust, we nevershall, preach this doctrine.All this but proves the truth of the New Testament prophecies,_Perilous_ times shall come, Evil men and seducers shall wax worseand worse, _deceiving_, and _being deceived_. If only we could all beinduced to read the signs of the times in the light of scripture! weshould then realize that we were in the thickest darkness of the worldsblackest night, the darkness immediately preceding the dawn, and weshould be looking for the Morning Star.Here, writing with swift, eager pen, he went over the ground covered byMajor H, as regarded the signs of the coming of the Lordthe movementamong the Jews; their excitement, as a race, over the date discovery5,666; the preparations for the rebuilding of the Temple. Then theincreased effort in the Foreign Mission fields. The growth of the spiritof lawlessness in the world, and in the church. The multiplicity ofspiritualistic devices_doctrine of Devils_. The awakening of all real,true, spiritually-minded Bible _students_ to the fact of Christs nearReturn. And the great, but often disregarded sign, the scoffers whoshall say where is the promise of His coming? for, since the Fathers fellasleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.But He _will_ come! He is near at hand! Every sign of the timesproclaims this! It is NIGHT, now, and He will come as a thief in thenight. At any moment now we may look for Him. Before this news-sheet,damp from the press, is in the hands of my readers, Christ _may_ havecome and taken away _every one_ of His own Believing people_I_ shall bemissing, another here, and another there will be missing.And when a puzzled, troubled London shall be gathering in business,that saying shall have come to pass, _The one shall be taken, the otherleft!_ (For though this word is _primarily Jewish_ in its application,it will yet have a measure of meaning for the world, when the Church istaken away).May every _Christian_ be ready to meet His Lord, when He shall come, andevery unready, unsaved soul who reads these Prophets Chamber columns,seek the face of God through faith in the Atoning work of Jesus Christ.For, believe me, His Return is very near, to some of us the sound of Hisfootfalls is even now in our ears.He bent his head over the written sheets, praying God to bless themessage. Then an interruption came. A knock at the door, and his sub,Ralph Bastin entered.CHAPTER XXIII.PASSOVER!Cohen, the Jew, blew out the candle, and set the stand aside. The kneesof his trousers were pressed and dusty. He had just been over the wholehouse, lighted candle in hand, and had searched every nook and crannie,every cupboard, every shelf, under the edge of every carpet, lookingfor the faintest sign of leaven in the form of bread, cake, or biscuitcrumb. He had found nothing, and went to his room to bathe and change hisclothing.What of you, Zillah? he had asked the lovely girl, earlier in the day.With your newly-espoused faith in the Nazarene, shall you partake of thelamb with us?Certainly, I will, she replied, _only_ I shall take the meal more inthe spirit of the Lords Supper, of the Christian Church. And AbrahamHer eyes, as they were lifted to his, swam with tender, pitying tears, asshe added:All the time I shall be praying that you may meet the Christ ofGod, Jesus of Nazareth; and while you seek to remember our peoplesdeliverance from the land of Bondage, I shall be praying that you, dearAbram, may be delivered from the bondage of the legalism of our race.       *       *       *       *       *The Passover table was spread in Cohens house. The arrangement of thattable was a curious mixture of Mosaic and Rabbinical command. In thecase of all but really very pious Jews of this day, the real and actualPassover is not kept.Passover(_chag Appesach_ of the Jews) _must_ have a lamb roasted to makeit the _real_ feast, the ordinary Jew to-day, contents himself with anegg, and a burnt shank-bone of mutton, and unleavened cakes.Cohens Passover Feast always included a small lamb. Still, Rabbinicallore and Bible command were curiously mixed in the Cohen celebration.The table, to-night, had an egg according to Rabbinical order, but therewas a tiny roast lamb as well. There was the glass dish of bitter herbs;the salt water, typifying the tears of Israelitish misery in Egypt; adish of almonds, apples, and other fruit, chopped and mixed, representedthe lime and mortar of the Brick-making in the Land of Bondage.Chervil and parsley were there, and lettuce. A large pile of unleavenedcakes, a big coloured glass ewer with unfermented wine and water, andmany other items considered to be the orthodox thing at the Feast.All the Cohen household was there. Zillah, radiant with the glow of thenew life in Christ that had come to her.Rachel, her sister, was red-eyed and sullen. Zillah had been pleadingwith her to open her mind, and her heart to the Christian teaching ofthe Messiah who had come, and who had atoned for _all_ the race, Jew andGentile alike.Angry and sullen, the wife had said hard things of Zillah. Her frivolous,irresponsible nature was more than satisfied with the barest _form_ ofthe faith of her race.The two children were full of suppressed excitement, the eldertheboyespecially.Cohen, the head of the house, was singularly quiet and grave. His eyeshad a far-away look in them. He looked like a man moving in a trance.Presently the boy, (he had been carefully coached) asked, according tothe usual formula:What mean ye, father, by this Service?Cohens eyes stared over the head of his son, and in a voice very unlikeits usual tones, replied:_It is the Sacrifice of Jehovahs Passover, who halted by theblood-sprinkled houses of our fathers in Egypt, that the destroying angelshould come not nigh, when He smote the Egyptians, but preserved ourfathers._Will our people _ever_ do this, father? queried the boy.Till Messiah come, they will, dear son. The strained gaze of Cohen, ashe answered, was as though he was trying to pierce Times veil, and seethe coming Messiah approaching._When_ will Messiah come, father? continued the boy._To-night_, perhaps, my son. Set His chair! Open the door!Swiftly, but with remarkable quietude, for a child, the boy placed achair at the table, then, stepping briskly, silently to the door, he setit wide open, and left it thus, and returned to his place by the table.Rachel took the ewer and poured out a little wine and water into eachglass. In her sullenness, as she came to Zillahs glass, she slopped thewine over the edge. The children glanced curiously from the spilled wineto the face of their aunt, then at their fathers face.Zillahs face flushed; Cohens grew pale, and set in a sharp spasm ofpain. No word was said, each took up their glass, and drank the _first_cup of blessing.There was a moments pause, then Cohen spread his hands, bowed his head,and repeated The Blessing:_The Lord bless us and keep us; the Lord make His face shine upon us andbe gracious unto us. The Lord lift up the light of his countenance uponus and give us peace._Under her breath, yet distinctly heard by Cohen, in the solemn hush thatfollowed the Blessing, Zillah murmured:_But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were afar off, are made nighby the blood of Christ._ FOR HE IS OUR PEACE.Cohen glanced quietly at her. She met the glance with one of intenseyearning. He translated it rightly, as meaning If _only_ you could seethis truth?There were two bowls of water set on a side-board. Cohen and his wiferinsed their hands in one bowl, Zillah and the two children in the other.Addressing himself to his son, more than to the others, Cohen, when theyhad returned to the table, as the head of the house was instructed to do,explained why they sat at the Feast:Our Fathers, when they took the Feast for the _first_ time in Egypt, myson, took it _standing_, with their loins girt, and their staff in hand,for _they_ were starting on that great journey that eventually lastedforty years. But we, their descendants, eat the feast to-day, _sitting_at our ease, as a symbol that our people have been delivered from thecruel bondage.Then the _first_ Hallel was repeated.Psalms 113, and 114. The _second_cup of Blessing was taken by each. Then Cohen asked a Blessing on _each_kind of food on the table. Then he carved a portion of lamb for each one,they took their seats, and the meal began.The children were excused from eating the stinging bitter herbs. ButCohen, Rachel, and Zillah, each took a little with their lamb andunleavened bread.Conversation became fairly general over the meal, except that Rachelssullen anger increased, and she kept silent.At the conclusion of the meal, the _third_ cup of Blessing was drunk, andCohen repeated the 115, 116, 117, 118, Psalm. At the close of the Hallel,the _fourth_, and last cup of Blessing was taken. The Feast was over.A sudden silence fell upon them all. No one moved, no one spoke, for amoment. Suddenly Zillah broke the dead silence. She had a glorious voice,and she let it ring out in that wondrous song:        Not all the blood of beasts        On Jewish altars slain    Could give the guilty conscience peace,        Or wash away our stain.No one interrupted. Cohen _could_ not, for the thrall of some strange,new power was upon him. His wife was furiousbut kept her fury bottledup. The children were delighted, they loved to hear their aunt sing, andto the amaze of their father and motherthey joined in the singing, for,with other children, they had often of late been to the evening meetingfor Jewish children. And Zillah, who had talked with them, believed thatthey loved the Christ.Without a break, the three voices sang on:        But Christ the Heavenly Lamb,        Takes all our sins away;    A sacrifice of nobler name,        And richer Blood than they.        My faith would lay her hand        On that meek head of Thine,    While as a penitent I stand,        And here confess my sin.        My soul looks back to see        The burden Thou didst bear    When hanging on the accursed tree,        And knows her guilt was there.        Believing we rejoice        To feel the curse remove;    We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,        And trust His bleeding love.Again, for full thirty seconds, as the glorious song finished, there wasan absolute silence, save for the ricketting of Rachels chair, as shemoved in pettish anger on her seat.Zillah had kept her eyes fixed upon Cohens face all the time she wassinging, and had seen a strangely wondrous light slowly gather in hiseyes. She had known, for days, that he was very, very near to the pointof acceptance of Christ. Even as they had gathered at the table of thePassover, she was not sure, but that in all but profession and testimony,he was a Christian.Now he suddenly broke the silence.Sing the last two verses again, Zillah he said.        _My_ soul looks back to see        The burden Thou didst bear    When hanging on the accursed tree,        And knows her guilt was there.Zillahs glorious voice rang out. And now, even to _her_ wonder, Cohensdeeper tones joined hers. Her heart leaped as she noted the emphasis heput upon the _My_ soul.She sang on. His voice sang on too. Then came the last verse, and in aperfect burst of triumph, his voice rang out:        Believing _I_ rejoice        To feel the curse remove;    _I_ bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,        And trust His bleeding love!It was a strangely ecstatic moment for Zillah. Tears flooded her eyes,she tried to speak, but her emotion choked her.Cohen stood up. His face was ablaze with the wonder of the revelationthat had come to him. He spread his hands upward, and his eyes werelifted in the same direction, as he cried:Thou loving Christ! Thou Precious Jesus! I am _Thine_THINETHINE!Then he remembered his wife.Rachael, dear heart, he cried, as he moved to her side. Machael, wifeof my heart. Jesus _is_ the Messiah!Bah! she cried. With a thrust of her hand and foot, she kept him fromher. Then in tones of withering scorn and disgust, she cried:Mehusmed!He bent over her very tenderly, stooping to meet her eyes, and trying totake her hand.The two children clung to Zillah, and the boy suddenly began to pipe out,in his clear treble, the hymn so beloved of Jewish children who attendthe mission meetings.    Come to the Saviour, Make no delay,Rachael shot a fiercely angry glance in the boys direction, then withoutlooking at her husband, she thrust at him, to prevent his taking herhand, as she cried:Accursed! Mehusmed! Dont touch _me_!But, Rachael! he began tenderly.She flung herself sharply round upon him and spat full in his face. Thenshe turned sharply from him again.A full half minute went by. The room grew so eerily still that itstartled her. She turned to gaze where the quartette had been.The room was empty save for herself!With a cry she started to her feet. They could not have gone out of thedoor for her chair had all the time stood right in the way. What was thisthen that had happened?Her breath came hot and laboured. Her eye-balls bulged horribly! Areeling sickness began to steal over her. She dropped back, terrified, inher chair, gasping:Zillah said this morning The Christ will come _soon, suddenly_, thenthose who are His, will be taken, unseen, unheard, from the world!With a sharp, anguished cry, she let her bulging, terror-filled eyessweep the room again as she cried:And my _children_, too!Her eyes were tearless, but dry, hard sobs shook all her frame.The next moment a kind of frenzy seized her. She rushed to the frontdoor, and into the street. She would find out if any one else was missing.A little crowd was on the pavement. A hansom cab stood by the curb. Thefare was standing on the front board. He was a minister of some kind. Hewore a M.B. waistcoat, a clerical collar, a soft, wide-brimmed, blackfelt hat. He glanced up at the drivers seat, as he cried:But _some_ one, _surely_, must have seen what became of him. If he felloff his box in a fit, where is his body?I seed him one hinstant, cried a voice from the crowd, I wur lookinstraight at im, cos I sed to myself, taint often as yer see a kebbywear a white at, now-a-days. Then, while I wur starin at im, he sorto disappeared, the reins fell on the roof o the keb, the oss stopped,anHes gone! shrieked a womans voice.It was Rachael. Bare-headed, dressed in all her festal finery, she hadjust rushed down the steps of the house, and heard the question andanswer as to the disappearance of the hansom driver. The crowd turned andfaced her, her shrill tones had startled them.Hes gone to Jehovah! she screamed again. My husband, my sister, mytwo childrenwe were at PassoverweWith a piercing shriek she flung up her arms, laughed hideously and fellin a huddled heap on the bottom step of the flight.CHAPTER XXIV.THIS SAYING SHALL COME TO PASS.Tom Hammond greeted his _sub_ most heartily. Ralph had been away, inParis, for a fortnight, partly on business, partly for a change.As soon as their greetings were exchanged, he turned eagerly to Hammond,as he said:But I say, old man, what on earth is all this jargon you wrote me about,the return of the Christ, andHe paused suddenly. His eyes had just caught sight of the great placard.His gaze was riveted on it. He read the two words aloud:TO-DAY? PERHAPS!In a voice of wondering amaze, he gasped:Whats _that_, Tom? What _does_ it mean?Tom Hammond repeated, in a few sentences, what he had previously writtento his friend, as to his conversion, then, passing on to the subject ofthe Lords second coming, he said:I am so impressed, Ralph, with the imminence of our Lords return, thatI have had that placard done to arrest the attention of callers uponme, and give me an opportunity of speaking to them about their eternaldestiny. To-day, too, I have been impressed so with the necessity ofspeaking to the worldThe Couriers world, I mean of courseon thisgreat, this momentous subject, that I have made it the subject of myProphets Chamber column.He gathered up the sheets of his M.S. he had written, and passed themover the table to Ralph Bastin.You will see, I have written it in the most simple, almost colloquialstyle, Ralph, he said. I wanted it to be a mans quiet, earnest, simpleutterance to his fellow man, and not a journalists article.Ralph Bastins eyes raced over the papers. His face was a strange study,while he read, reflecting a score of different, ever-changing emotions,but amid them all never losing a constant deepening amaze.As he finished the last sheet, he looked Tom Hammond hard and searchinglyin the face.My dear Tom, he began. His voice was very grave, very serious. Youllruin The Courier! You will ruin yourself! The world will call you mad!They called my Lord mad, Ralph, and they have called His servants mad,over and over again, ever since.There was not a shadow of cant in his voice and manner, as he went on:The word of our God, Ralphwhich is the _only real_ rule of life, tellsus that Christ, whose name I profess, said:Whosoever shall confess me, before men, him will I confess also beforemy Father which is in Heaven.... If any man will come after Me, _lethim deny himself_, and take up his cross _daily_, and follow Me. Forwhosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose hislife, for My sake, the same shall save it. For what is a man advantaged,if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul....For whosoever shall be ashamed of me _and of My words_. (_Surely Icome quickly_, Ralph, is one of _His very last_ recorded words,) of himshall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory,and in His Fathers, and of the holy angels.Tom Hammond leant forward in his chair to lay his hand on the wristof the other, to plead with him. But, with an exclamation of angryimpatience, Ralph, cried:Hang it, old man, you must be going dotty!With an expression of annoyance, almost amounting to disgust, he swunground on his heel.Look here, Tom, he began.He swirled back to meet his friend face to face.Then, with a startled cry, he stared at the chair, in which, an instantbefore, Tom Hammond had been sitting.The chair was empty!Good God! he gasped.Instinctively he knew what had happened! Involuntarily his eyes travelledto the Placard, and in the same moment he recalled the closing words ofTom Hammonds M.S. which he had just read:_Then shall it come to pass, that which is written_, ONE SHALL BETAKEN, THE OTHER LEFT.A strange, unnatural trembling seized him. He dropped into the chair hehad been occupying, and stared at the empty revolving chair opposite.GoodGod! He slowly repeated the words. There was no thought ofirreverence in the utterance. It was the unconscious acknowledgment ofGods Presence and Power.For a timehe never knew how longhe sat still and silent like a manstunned. Then, as his eyes travelled slowly to where the sheets of M.S.slay, he smiled wearily, drew them towards him, and took his stylo fromhis pocket. Putting the most powerful pressure of his will upon himself,he began to write after the last works penned by his translated chief:P.S.Written by the sub-editor of The Courier. By the time thisprinted sheet is being read, the world will have learned that a sectionof the community has been suddenly taken from our midst. The Editor ofThe Courier, the giant mind and kindly heart of Tom Hammond, have beentaken from us.The writer of this postscript, who was in the room, when the Prophetof The Courier was taken, was in the act of scorning his message as tothe nearing of the great translation. In a moment, in the twinkling ofan eye he was gone.The writer has not left the room since, and has no means of knowingwho else among those known to him are missing,not many _personal_acquaintances, he fears, since ones personal clique has never shown anyvery marked signs of what one has _hitherto_ considered an _ultra_ typeof Christianity, a condition of _righteous overmuch_.When we pass out of this room, presently, and touch the great outsideworld once more, what shall we find? How soon will it be generally knownthat a section of the communitya larger section, maybe, than we conceivepossiblehas been silently, suddenly, secretly taken from our midst? Whatwill follow? Where are the prophets who shall teach us where we are, andwhat we may expect? Does the end of the world follow next? Is there anyorder of events, specified in the Bible, that follows this mysterioustranslation, if so, what is it? Who will show us these things?Again, since I, the writer of this postscript, am left, while my friend,Hammond, is taken, _why am I left_, and why shall I findas of courseI shall when I begin to go abroad among mine acquaintancehundreds ofothers _left_? I have been christened, confirmed, have occasionallycommunicated,this is the clerical term, though as I write, itoccurs to me that there must have been some flaw, somewhere, in the_communicating_.I have always supposed myself a Christian by virtue of these things,to which a clean, decent life has been added. Thousands upon thousands,I feel sure, will be puzzled by this same contemplation, when thiswonderful Translation becomes generally known.If we are not made Christians by christening, confirmation,communicating, why have we always been taught so, by our clergy? How manyof these same clergy shall we find _left_ behind.And I suppose there will have been some kind of kindred process at workamong the Nonconformists bodiesin pulpit and pew, alike. For ourselves,we have come little in contact with Nonconformity, but, if what isaccepted generally, to-day, as to the religious situation, be truethatthe curse of the Ritualism of the Establishment, finds its parallel inthe Rationalism, Unitarianism, Socialism, etc., of Nonconformitythen Ishall expect to find as many Nonconformists, lay and ministerial, _left_behind from this mysterious, spiritual translation, as churchmen.There came a tap at the door. The messenger boy Charley, appeared. Heglanced towards the empty Editors chair, then stammered.I beg pardon, sir, I thought Mr. Hammond was here, sir. They have jestblown up the tube to know if the Prophets column was ready.Ralph Bastin noticed that the eyes of the boy flitted from his face tothe placard.Know what that means, Charley? Bastin asked.Yus, sir, leastways, I knows what Mr. Hammond means by it! E sez thatJesus Christs comin back, an goin to take all the real Christiansout er the world, an nobody wont see em go, nor nothink. I eard Mr.Hammond splainin it all to a gent, tother day.Curious to know if the boy himself had thought seriously at all of thematter, Bastin said:What do _you_ think of it, Charley?Wal, its like this, sir, I aint been to no Sunday School since I wusquite a young un, bout eight perhaps. An I never goes to no Church norChapel, cos why? Why cos Sundays the only daycepts my olidayswhen Igits any chance fur any rickreation or fresh hair. So I aint up much inligious things. But my sister, Lulu, she walks out wi a chap as teachesin a Sunday Schoolleastways, he oosed to afore he took up wi our Lulu,but now e wants is Sunday School time fur spoonying, an e can spoon,sir, theres no errorwell, knowin as e oosed to do summat at ligion,I ups an arsks im about what Mr. Hammond said, about that takin awaybusiness, an e (Jimmy Doubleyou, Lulus chap, I mean, sir,) larfed,an said, Dont yer blieve any sich rot! Dyer think Gawd ud go an_kidnap_ all Is people like that?[1]    [1] At a Bible-Reading in Malvern in the house of one of Gods    choicest saints, Miss Ann Boobbyer, where the precious truth of    _The Rapture_ was being unfolded, a minister present, who was    much used of God, as an evangelist, started up, and cried,    What! My Lord coming to _Kidnap_ all His people? Never! Never!    Ill not believe that!Ralph Bastin would have smiled, at any other time, at this curiousreply. But, to-night, his soul was too sobered. Gathering up the sheetsof M.S.s, he clipped them together, stamped them with Hammondsmechanical imprimatur, and handed the sheaf to the lad, giving himinstructions to deliver them in the Composing Room.As the lad left the room, he sat back in his chair, and tried to thinkout the position of affairs. He had hardly settled himself down, beforethe messenger boy returned.Scuse me, sir, the lad began, but summat curious hev appened.Theres two holy Joes, in the Composing room, an one in the Sterioroomleastways, they oosed to bean theys all three bunked off,somewheres, nobody seed em go, an their coats an ats is ung hup wherethey ussally is, an some o the chaps says as theys translated. AlfCharman, one o the comps, oosed to talk like Mr. Ammond did, sirThe boy looked a trifle fearsomely at the empty editors chair, as headded.Mr. Ammond, sir, IerI suppose asee aint.Mr. Hammond has gone out! Bastin rapped out the words quite sharply.All this talk of the missing men was getting on his nerves.That will do, Charley! he added.The lad walked slowly to the door, his eyes fixed on the placard, hislips moving to the words, _To-day? Perhaps!_Coorius! he muttered as he passed out of the room.Ralph Bastin tried again to settle himself down for a quiet think.Suddenly he started to his feet, wild of eye, and with horror in his face.Viola? he muttered. My beautiful little Viola? She has talkedcontinuously of the Christ of late. Has she been?He seized his hat, and with a crushed down sob of literal fear, he rushedaway.Outside the office he came upon a hansom. He leaped into it, shouting theBloomsbury address to the man.Drive for your life! he yelled. A sovereign for you if you get methere quickly!The mans horse was fresh. They rushed through the streets. Arrivingat the house, he tossed the driver his promised sovereign, and lettinghimself in with his latch key, he dashed into the drawing room. It wasempty!He was leaving the room hurriedly, when he encountered the landlady.Miss Viola has gone to bed, sir, she overtired herself, visiting thesick-poor with her flowers, and all that, to-day, and sheThanks! with a hurried nod he raced up the stairs. The childs bedroomwas next to his own. He entered it without knocking. He was too muchagitated to stand upon ceremony.The room was in darkness, he struck a match, laid it to the gas nipple,then shot a quick glance at the bed. In that first glance, he saw that itwas empty. He went close up to the bed, it had been occupied, he couldsee that. He thrust his hand well down under the clothes. There was faintbody warmth left in the beddingor it seemed so to him.God help me? he groaned. And two great tears fell glittering from hiseyes.Viola! Viola! my precious darling! he moaned. You were my life, myHis emotion choked him. He was dropping into the chair by the bedside,when he noticed that the back and seat of the chair were strewn with theunder-clothing, which the child had evidently placed there when disrobing.With eyes blinded with tears, he lifted the dainty garments in a pile,and laid them on the foot of the bed. Then he dropped back into thechair, buried his face in the pillowthe impress of the lost, beautifulhead was left in the pillowand wept.For five minutes he remained thus. Then rousing himself, he muttered:Imust play the man! and get back to the office and lay hold of things.He left the room, and managed to clear the house without encountering hislandlady. Lucky in finding a hansom, he had himself driven first to thecentral News Agency. He wanted to find out if anything of the mystery wasgenerally known.The careless-minded, light-hearted tapists, clerks and journalists, werelaughing over the few vague rumours of the translation that had reachedthem.He said nothing of what he knew, and drove on to the office.If the world has to go on, for a time, just as it _has_ been going, inspite of this wonderful thing, he muttered, then, as acting editor ofthe Courier, I had better stifle every feeling, save the professional,and give LondonEnglandthe best morning issue under the new condition ofthings.CHAPTER XXV.FOILED!Thin and pale, but with the likeness of God shining in her darkeyesthere was the bruise-like colour of great exhaustion under eacheyeMrs. Joyce sat wearily stitching at her warehouse needle-work.Jem Joyce, the drunken, reprobate husband, was serving a six weekssentence for his old crime, drunken disorderliness in the streets, andassaulting the police. His time would soon be up. The fearsome wife hadrecalled the fact, that very day, though she could not be sure of the_actual_ date.As she worked now her voice whispered low in song:    It may be in the evening,      When the work of the day is done,    And you have time to sit in the twilight      And watch the sinking sun,    When the long, bright day dies slowly      Over the sea,    And the hour grows quiet and holy      With thoughts of Me;    While you hear the village children      Passing along the street,    Among those thronging footsteps      May come the sound of _My_ feet.    Therefore I tell _you_: Watch      By the light of the evening-star,    When the room is growing dusky      As the clouds afar;    Let the door be on the latch      In your home,    For it may be through the gleaming      I will come.Low, soft, yearning in its passionate longing for her Lords Return,she began again to hum her lay, when a step sounded somewhere near.So keenly had her imagination been aroused by her song, and by herlong, yearning-dwelling on the theme of the song, that she, almostunconsciously to herself, rose to her feet, her work and needle heldlightly in her hand, her face turned towards the door. For one instant,her imagination had suggested the step to have been her Lords.The next moment she turned deadly pale. She had recognized the step. Itwas her husbands.She had just time to drop back into her chair, and, tremblingly, toresume her work, when the brute entered. He was drunkviciously,murderously drunk.He began to curse her, the moment he crossed the threshold. He called herfoul names that brought the flush of a great shamefor _him_, not forherselfto her cheeks. He sneered at her religion, and blasphemed thename of her Lord.Her lips moved, but no sound came from them. She prayed for grace to besilent, for she feared to aggravate him. Suddenly, he shook his fist inher face, and hissed:Curse you! You ! Do you know Ive only come back to you to settle allmy scores. Ive come toHis foaming, blaspheming rage choked him, and he leaped forward, (she haddrawn back from his clenched fist) and caught her by the throat.She could not cry out. She thought his purpose was to strangle her. Heglared murderously back into her eyes, which his awful grip was forcingfrom their sockets. He shook her fiercely, hurling hideous blasphemies ather all the time. Then he essayed to put his real purpose in view, anddrawing himself up, and drawing her, at the same time, towards himself,he hurled himself forward to dash her head against the wall of the room.It was _his_ head that struck the wall. His hands clutched air. He fellhead-long stunned, bleeding, andpresently, he was dead.The room was very still. Awesomely silent.Margaret Joyce was _in the air_, with her Lord!CHAPTER XXVI.A CASTAWAY.Madge and her husband left Albany on the Monday morning, ostensibly fora brief honey-moon, but, chiefly, with a view to recruit her husbandshealth. They had gone to a tiny little house among the Catskills, kept bya coloured woman named Julie. The pastor had been there before, and hadhimself chosen this quiet retreat for their marriage trip.The heart of Madge was broken, for her husband would not be friendly withher. He was barely civil when he spoke to her, and answered her in short,sharp monosyllables only. All the old natural pride, with which she wouldhave met this treatment a fortnight ago, or less, was, fortunately, for_him_, swallowed up in her new found faith _in_, and her utter surrender_to_ God. And with this there had come to her the patience and purifying,born of the Hope of the near return of the Lord, whom she now loved.She had been alone, thinking over the whole position, for a couple ofhours. The situation had become intolerable. She determined to make anappeal to him, though it hurt her natural pride even to contemplate it.Help me! Teach me! Guide me! she cried unto her God. And in thestrength of the divine promises of upholding and guidance, she decided togo to her husband.       *       *       *       *       *He was alone, with a book before him on the table. But he was notreading. He was not even thinking. His mind was in a confused whirl,born of the inward rage of a much discomfited man. He had made a fool ofhimself, in public. He knew it, and he had been too proud to apologize.He had spurned and snubbed the woman, for whom he had professed to bedying of love, and who had made the greatest sacrifice any honest womancan make to mansince she had offered herself to him, in marriage.He knew that, in the eyes of his wife, and in the eyes of the littleworld he had lived and laboured in, that he had lowered himself, hadproved himself less than ordinarily human.Some of his own recent platform and pulpit utterances, returned to hismind, and they stung him by their reproach. The very last sermon he hadpreached, before his breakdown of health, had had for its text, To himthat overcometh, will I give.In the course of his address he had alluded to the shame of some oflifes failures, and had quoted William S. Walshs Ichabod.Now, as he sat brooding over his own fall, the lines returned to him.They mocked him, gibed at him, becoming, to his brooding imagination,sentient things with laughing, mocking, sneering voices, that somehowcontrived to fling back into his ears, the very tones of his own voice,as he had declaimed the verses from his platform, weeks ago:    Alas, for the lofty dreaming,      The longed-for high emprise,    For the man whose outer seeming      His inner self belies!    I looked on the life before me      With purpose high and true,    When the passions of youth surged oer me,      And the world was strange and true.    Where the hero-soul rejoices      I would play the heros part;    My ears were attuned to the voices      That speak to the poets heart.    I would conquer a place in story,      With a soul unsmirched by sin;    My heart should be crowned with glory,      My heart be pure within.    _But the hour that should have crowned me,_      _Cast all high hope adown,_    _And the time of trial found me,_      _A sinner, coward, clown._The thought that many of those who heard him declaim those lines, wouldbe now recalling them, and perhaps be applying them to himself, halfmaddened him. And it was at this worst of all moments for her mission ofreconciliation, that Madge entered the room.With a rare gentleness she began to plead with him, reminding him ofall the passionate love he had expressed for her up to the very moment,almost, when they entered the church together for that Sunday morningservice.He answered her coldly, sullenly at first. Then he grew pettishly angrywith her, and snapped sharply at her, contradicting her in nearly all shesaid:But, Homer, she pleaded again, and in the deep yearning heart to winhim back to his old loving self, she knelt before him, and tried to takehis hand.With an angry exclamation, he rose sharply to his feet and thrust heraway with his foot, as he cried:I dont want you! You go your way, Ill go mine, andHe stopped suddenly. With a sharp cry of agony, he stretched his handsout into the empty space, where an instant before, she had kneltfor, inone flashing moment, she had disappeared from before his eyes.Madge! Madge, dear love, dear love, dear wife! he cried.The sound of his own voice struck chilly upon his soul. Deep, deep downin his heart he knew what had happened_only he would not own it tohimself_.He flashed a swift glance at the window and door. Both were fast shut.This is what Doig preached! What Madge believed would come to pass! hecried, hoarsely.There was a strange look of terror in his eyes.Julie will have gone, too, if it _is_ thethe.He did not finish his muttered thought. Like a man walking in his sleep,he moved to the door, opened it, and called, loudly:Julie!There came no reply. An eerie stillness was in the house.He moved on into the kitchen, the room was empty. A saucepan of milk wasboiling over on the hot-plate of the grate!He hurried into the garden, calling Madge! Julie! There was no response.He went back to the house. The turkeys had strayed into the kitchen,there being no one to drive them back. He made a hurried, fearsome tourof the house. Every room was empty!He went back to where he had been, when Madge was taken, with a groan hedropped into his chair, staring into space with horror-stricken eyes.Suddenly, as though a living voice uttered them, the words of scripturesounded in his ears._Lest, that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myselfshould be a castaway!_A mortal agony filled his eyes, as he groaned:God help me! I know now that I have only been a _minister_, by trainingand by profession, I have never been a son of God by conversion, by theNew Birth!His untaught soul had misinterpreted the real inwardness of that passageof Pauls. But it was true, in the sense _he_ meant it, he _was_ acastaway.CHAPTER XXVII.A STRICKEN CITY.It was not really until business time next morning, that London, that thewhole country, really fully awoke to the fact of the great event of theprevious night. Suburbans, in many cases, only heard the strange news ontheir arrival at their particular railway stations. Even then, a hundredrumours were the order of the moment. Everything reported was vague andshadowy. There were a few rank unbelievers of the garbled stories ofthe translation, who laughed sceptically, then began to grumble at thestrange disorganization of the Railway traffic.More than one annoyed, belated traveller, remarked in similar terms tothe utterance of a commercial traveller, at Surbiton station:If there is _any_ actual truth in this story of the secret translationof a number of religious people, then the mysterious taking away of somany signal-men, and engine-men, will be an eye-opener to the travellingpublic, who never, somehow, suppose that Christianity is a strong factorin the lives of railway men.It is a revelation in another way, remarked a second, since itsuggests _why_ we have hitherto had so few railway accidents, _comparedwith other nations_.The tens and hundreds of thousands, the millions, poured into London asusual. But the snap had gone out of most of them. A horrible sense offoreboding, was upon the spirits of the travellers. As the newspapersmore fully confirmed the news, London approached perilously near theverge of a general panic.The newspapers were bought up with phenomenal eagerness. Souf EfrikenWar wornt in it, fur clearin out peepers! a street seller remarked.But few of the morning papers, (except the Courier) had anythingspecial to say on the great event. Most of them, in fact, were absolutelysilent.There were weather prophecies, political prophecies, financialprophecies, social prophecies, sporting prophecies, commercialprophecies,but no prophecy of the Coming of the Christ.The Couriers rival had a brief note to the effect:Some wild, senseless rumours were abroad in London last night, as tothe sudden, mysterious disappearance of numbers of the _ultra_ religiouspersons of London, and elsewhere. Some people talked wildly of the end ofthe world. We therefore despatched special commissioners, to ascertainwhat truth there was in all this.Our representative returned an hour and a half later, after havingvisited all the chief places of amusement and principal restaurants. Buteverywhere managers told the same story, there has been no signs of theend of the world in _our_ place. We are fuller than ever.The genial manager of the  Theatre, assured our Representative, that nolater than last Sunday morning, he heard it repeated at his Church, thatas it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, _world withoutend_, Amen. So that, for the life of him, he could not conceive any onebeing such a fool as to talk of the end of the world.But the note of the Couriers clarion call had no uncertain sound.Besides all that we have already seen written in the office by thetranslated Tom Hammond, and afterwards by Ralph Bastin, the latter hadadded to his postscript, another. It was a solemn, a pathetic word, andran as follows:Our sheets must go to press in a few moments, if the Courier is to bein the hands of its readers at the usual hour. But before we print, wefeel compelled to add a word or two more to what we wrote two hours ago.During the last two hours, we have made many discoveries, not theleast of which, from the _personal_ standpoint, is the fact, that thenearest and dearest being to our own heart and life, one whose life andthought, of late, has been strangely taken up by the Christ of God, ismissing. She has shared in the glory and joy of the wondrous, mysterious,andto _most_ of us, to _all_ of us surely who are _left__unexpected_translation.We have no wish or intention to parade our own personal griefs beforeour readers, but dare to say that no journalist ever worked with a morebroken, crushed sense of life, than did we during the two hours weafterwards spent in searching London for facts.One curious fact which we speedily discovered, was, that no one hadbeen taken in this wondrous translation, from any of the Theatres ormusic-halls. In the old daysfour _hours_ ago, seems, to look back to,like four centuriesbefore this awfully solemn event, discussions arose,periodically, in certain religious and semi-religious journals, as towhether _true_ Christians could attend the theatre and music-hall.The fact that no one appears to have been translated from any of theseLondon houses of amusement, answers, we think, that question, as it hasnever been answered before.Here followed a brief _resume_ of his experiences in other quarters. Thenin big black type he asked the question:WHAT FOLLOWS, (ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE PROGRAM) THIS STUPENDOUSEVENT?The Bible, evidently, (when read aright) told those, who have beentaken from our midst, that this translation was approaching, then it mustsurely give some hint of what we may expect to follow so startling anepisode as that of to-night. The question is, _what_ follows?There must surely be many clergymen and ministers who knew _about_ thisgreat translation, who though not living in the spirit of what they knew,and being therefore left behind, like the common ruck of those of us,who were carelessly ignorantthere must be many such ministers left, whocould teach us _now, what_ to expect _next_, and _how_ to prepare for thenext eruptionwhatever form it may take.We therefore propose to any such ministers, that they gather us intothe Albert Hall, Agricultural Hall, St. Pauls Cathedral, SpurgeonsTabernacle, Whitfieldswhy not, in fact, into every church, chapel,Salvation Army Barracks, or even in the great open spaces such as HydePark, and other Parks, Primrose Hill, Hampstead Heath, etc., and teachus, who are left behind from the wondrous Translation, that has justoccurred, how to be prepared for the next mighty change, for we believethe bulk of us are absolutely in the dark.Meanwhile, are there no houses in Paternoster Row, and itsneighbourhood, where books and pamphlets on these momentous subjects canbe obtained, or are all such publishers translated with those of whom wehave been writing?One effect of the last suggestion, in Bastins _second_ postscript, wasto send thousands of people to Paternoster Row, the Square, Ivy Lane,and all the neighbourhood. Some of the publishers of books on the LordsSecond Coming, _had_ been _left_ behind, had _not_ shared in the Raptureof which they had printed and published.Storekeepers, packers, masters, clerks, were most of them reading up thecontents of their own wares. Business system among them, at first, seemedan unknown quantity. Deadness, amaze, fear, uncertainty, all of thesethings held and dominated them.But they had to wake up. Their counters were besieged. Hordes of peoplethronged the doors. In twenty minutes after the first great influx, therewas not a tract, a booklet, or a volume, on the Lords coming, and theevents to follow, left in the Row.At any other time those in command of the stores, would have tried toget the printing presses at work, to run off some hundreds of thousandsof the briefest of the Second Advent literature. But, to-day, fear,nameless fear held every one in thrall.The Row put up shutters, and went homeor at least got away frombusiness.Business, everywhere, was at a standstill. By eleven oclock most ofthe city houses were closed. Some of the banks never opened at all.Throgmorton Street and the Stock Exchange were in a state of dazedincredulity. A few members were missing, and these were known to beExpectants of the Translation.Salvation S, is gone! some one called out.Aye! cried another, Id give all I possess, or ever hoped to possess,to be where he is now. I remember how he tried and prayed to persuade meonce toThere was a rush of members across The Floor at that moment. Some onehad a proposition to make, namely a trip to 101 Queen Victoria Street, tosee if there were any Salvationists left there. A little band, about adozen, responded, and the silk-hatted, excited little crowd swept away ontheir curious quest.CHAPTER XXVIII.HALLELUJAH LASS.There was one Hallelujah Lass, in the front shop, at theHeadquarters. She was bonnetless, but the big, navy-blue head-dresslaid on a glass show-case. She wore a finely-knitted crimson jersey andbraided blue skirt. Her eyes were red with weeping. She was strangelydistraught. There was no lilt of the song upon her lips:    Oh! the peace my Saviour gives,    Peace I never knew before.Not all translated then? began the leader of the Stock Exchange band,addressing her.There was nothing flippant, nothing sneering in his tone or manner.The girl essayed a reply, but at first it ended in a sob only. Presentlyshe recovered herself enough to say:No, were not _all_ translated! You see, sir, the Army, as a body, neverquite admitted the truth of _this_ Second coming of our Lord. It hasalways preached that we, as an Army of Salvation, were raised up by Godto get _all the world_ converted. A lady in the train, as I came up tobusiness, only yesterdayThe girl sighed wearily, as she interpolated, Yesterday seems as far offas Wesleys times. But, only yesterday, this lady, in the train talked tome about the Lords near returnthat is how _she_ put itand said, Godis undoubtedly using the Army in evangelizing the distant heathen, andthus allowing them to fulfil His purpose in calling out those who are toform the Bride of the Heavenly Bridegroombut, believe me, my dear, theworld will never be converted _before_ Christ comes for His Church.She talked to me very beautifully, and simply, only, as she said, onecould only grasp these truths in proportion as one kept clear in theirminds the things which belonged to the separate dispensations.If, she said, The Lord came to-nighthow little she or I dreamedthat He actually wouldthis dispensation would be closed, and a new onewould begin to-morrow.The girl looked around in a bewildered way, almost as though she waslooking for something she had lost.I have never known anything about the dispensations, and their bearingon the Bible, she went on. The Army has always taught us that we should_all_ die, lie in our graves until the _last Day_, then appear beforethe Great White Throne, and be judged according to our lives, and allthat. The lady who spoke to me yesterdayyesterday? oh, how far off itseemsexplained to me, _from the Bible_, that true Christians would_never_ appear before the Great White Throne.That when the Great White Throne shall be set, the real Christian willbe seated in glory _with_ Jesus, the Judge. And only the wicked, unsaveddead will be judged there. The sin of the _true_ Christian, she said, isdone with, settled, put away at the Cross.There is therefore _now no_ condemnation (_judgment_) to them who are_in_ Christ Jesus. He that heareth, and believeth on Jesus, _hath_everlasting life, and _shall not come into the judgment_, but _is_passed from death unto life.She told me that the true Christian, who might be living, when the Lordshould Return, would be caught up _into the air_, with all the Christiandead, who will rise from their graves; and, that then the only judgmentthat can ever come to the Christian, will take place. That will be atChrists judgment _of Rewards_. She said that eternal life did not enterinto the question. That was settled once and for ever, but at ChristsReward-judgment, the Christians _work_ would be tried.Some of the silk-hatted listening men began to fidget. All this talk wasforeign and uninteresting to them.The lady, the girl went on, promised to meet me this morning at thestation, at the same time as we met yesterday, _Should the Lord Tarry_she said. But I saw nothing of her this morning. She had been _caughtup_, of course, to meet her Lord in the air, and IThe girls voice broke, her eyes streamed with tears. One of the youngestof the stock-brokers asked:But why, if Salvationists are Christians, are _you_ here? Why were _you_not translated?God help me! she cried, I know _now_, now that it is too late, thatI was never converted. I was drawn into an Army meeting by reports Iheard of the singing and music. The Armys methods fascinated metheyoung officer who came to our town, was a very taking fellow. He talkedto me in an after-meeting, I wept with the many emotions that were atwork within me; I went to the penitent formandandafterwards joined theSalvation Armybut I know _now_, I was not really saved.She caught her breath in a quick sob, then a little glow suddenly filledher face, as she added:But I have settled the matter this morning. I have yielded,intelligently to Christ, and I know that    Jesus with me is united,      Doubting and fears they are gone;    With Him now my soul is delighted,      I and King Jesus are one.And, she cried, her eyes flashing with a holy light, If witnessing forJesus means martyrdom, then, by Gods grace, Ill show by my death thatAre there many Salvationists left? interrupted one of her listeners.A quick flush dyed her cheek; as she replied:I _cant_ say! There are some here at head-quarters, whom I should nothave thought would have been _left behind_, but who are. Though I dontbelieve there will be more, if so many Salvationists, as other sects, _inproportion_, be found to be left behind, orThe sound of thousands of tramping feet broke into the girls speech. Thelittle crowd of Stock-brokers rushed to the door.A dense mass of men and women were marching up the street. Every face wasset and serious. There were many clergymen and ministers in the crowd, ifthe clerical collar and ministerial garb gave true indication of theircalling.To St. Pauls! To St. Pauls! a stentorian voice was shouting.The stock-brokers joined the mighty crowd, which, grim, resolute, silent,swept on.       *       *       *       *       *By midnight, or soon after, a few hours only after the great Translation,the hordes of the vicious that festered in the slumswomen, as well asmen, _aliens_ and British alikehad heard something of what had happened,and creeping from their filthy lairs, began, at once to become a menaceto public life and property.Many of the police beats were unprotected, the men who had beenpatrolling them sharing in the sudden glorious Rapture of their Lordsreturn. By midnight, the whole police service had become temporarilydisorganized, if not actually demoralized.Scotland Yard heads of departments were missing, as well as localSuperintendents, Sergeants, etc. In many cases there was no one to giveorders, or to maintain control. And where leaders _were_ left, they wereoften too scared and unnerved to exercise a healthful authority.Under these circumstances the hordes of vicious, and out of work grewbolder every hour. They had no fear of the Spiritual character of thestrange situation, for God, to them, was a name only to blaspheme. Hellwas a merry jest to them, a synonym for warmth and rest,a combinationwhich had been all too rare with them on earth. Besides, Hell had noshadow of terror to people who, for years, had suffered the torments of alife in a literal hell in London.Shops, and private houses, and some of the larger business houses hadbeen openly burgled. A rumour got abroad, that the Banks were to beraided.Ralph Bastin, passing the Bank of England, found that the guard ofSoldiers had been quadrupled, and this too for the _day_-time. Curious toknow how the Translation of the night before had affected the army, heasked one of the privates if any of the London soldiers were missing?All the blue-lights, (as we calls the Christians, sir,) is missin.Yer see, sir, if a feller perfesses to be a Chrishun in the Army, anaint real, e soon gits the perfession knocked outer im. On the otherhan if es real, why all the persekushun ony drives is ligion deeperinter im. Yes, all the blue-lights is gone, sir, an any amount oofficers.These, as is gone, is mosly the middle-age an ole ones, an thosewots been in India, Malta, an other furrin stations.

Ah, they wur _right_, they wur, the other wur wrong, an thewrong uns knows to-day as theys out o luck!If yer arsks my erpinun, ser, I sez, that Londons full o fools,to-day, fur if wed all been doin an thinkin as wed oughter, why wedbe now up in Glory wi Jesus. Ive yeard the truth at Sodger Homes, ansich places, an Ive sung wi lots o others:    Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching;      In his glory they shall share:    If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,      Will He find us watching there?    O, can we say we are ready, brother?      Ready for the souls bright home?    Say, will He find you and me still watching,      Waiting, waiting, when the Lord shall come?The man suddenly straightened himself, and glanced away from Bastin. Anofficer was approaching.Ralph Bastin walked away, the thought that filled his mind, was of thestrange mood that had suddenly come over _every_one, since to-day,everybody seemed ready to talk freely of religious things.He moved on up Cheapside, his destination being St. Pauls Cathedral.CHAPTER XXIX.IN ST. PAULS.The cathedral was packed, packed out to the doors. The aisles, and everyother inch of standing-room was a solid Jam. The whole area of theinterior showed one black mass of silent waiting, expectant peopleit wascurious to note that almost every woman had donned black, in some form orother.The great organ was silent. No one dreamed of singing. The choir seatswere full of strangers. The stalls were filled with an indiscriminatecrowd. There was no rule, no discipline to-day.Suddenly the tall, square-built form of a certain well-known Bishop, rosenear the pulpit. He had linked his arm in that of one of Londons mostpopular Nonconformist preachers, and almost dragged him to his feet.There was evidently a controversy going on between the two men as towhich of them should address the people, each urging the other to leadoff. The same thought was in the minds of nearly all who were in view ofthe pair, _namely_, how comes it that a Bishop, and a popular preacherlike the Rev. , have been left behind?A strange new tenseness, a deepening silence, settled upon the mightymass gathered under that great dome. Suddenly the silence was broken by avoice calling:Bishop . Another voice immediately cried, No! The Rev. .A momentary clamour of voices ensued. The voices were not shrill in theireagerness, but sullen, sombre, almost savage, in fact. A moment, and theBishop slowly entered the pulpit. He bowed his head in prayer.Like the slow, rushing sound of the letting loose of some distant water,the noise of thousands of bending forms filled the place, for everyonebowed the head.A moment later, the heads were raised. The silence almost of a tombfilled the place, when the first momentary rustle of the uprearing hadsubsided.The voice of the Bishop broke the silence, crying:Men and women of London, fellows with me in the greatest shame the worldhas ever knownthe shame of bearing the name Christian, and yet of beingthe rejected of Christ,we meet to-day under awful, solemn circumstances.We are face to face with the most solemnly awful situation the humanrace has ever known, if we except the conditions under which, duringthose three hours of blackness at Calvary, the people of Jerusalem werefound, while the Crucified Christ hung mid-air, on the Fatal Tree.It may be said that our position bears some likeness to that of thepeople who were destroyed at the Flood. Those antediluvians had onehundred and twenty years warning, we, as professing Christians, have hadnearly two thousand years warning, yet, London, England and the wholeworld has by last nights events, been proved practically heathenoratheist, atheist will perhaps best fit our character.The moment came when God called Noah and his family into the ark. Butwhat never occurred to me, until this morning, was the significant fact,that God did not shut the door of the ark, or send the flood, until_seven days later_, thus giving the unbelievers another opportunity to besaved.And God has given London, England, America, the world, this same extraopportunity of being prepared for the Return of the Lord, and theTranslation of His Church.For, for some years, now, conferences, and conventions, addresses,Bible-Readings, etc., where this subject of the Second Coming of Christhas been specially taught, has been multiplied mightily. I have beenpresent at some of these gatherings, but, smiling amusedly at what Itermed the wild utterances of visionaries, I neglected my opportunity.Yet, of all men, _I_ ought to have been prepared for this Coming ofthe Lord. I have held ministerial office in a church that taught thedoctrine, plainly, in many of its prayers and collects. But I see,now, that all through my life, I have been blinded by the _letter_ ofthings, and have mistaken christening, confirmation, communicating, forconversion, and for life in Christ.I see, to-day, that I entered the established church of this realm, andnot the family of God, and the service of Christ. I have never reallybeen Gods, by the New Birth, until last night, when my dear wife, incompany with all the waiting, longing church, was suddenly called up tobe with her Lord. Not by death, dear friendsshe saw no deathbut by thatsudden translation, that has startled us all so.A low sobbing sound ran through all the building. The gathered thousands,almost to a man, realised that they, with the speaker, were equallylifeless, spiritually.I was in the room when my wife disappeared, the Bishop went on. Shehad been very ill. It became necessary to perform a critical operation onher. I insisted on being present. I see the scene now.The nurses standing by the antiseptic baths with the sponges and clipsimmersed. In the eerie silence of that room, no sound came save the voiceof the great surgeon, as he cried clipiodoformbandages. Suddenly,as he half turned to take a bandage of the nurse, the form of my preciouswife disappeared from the operating table. One of the nurses at theantiseptic bowl, was gone also.And I, a _professed_ servant of the Christ who had called the translatedones, was _left_, with the great surgeon, and others, as you, dearfriends, many, _most_ perhaps, members of some Christian church, havebeen left.Sister Carrie gone too! cried the great surgeon, then you may depend,Bishop, that Christ has come for all His real church, for Nurse Carrielived in daily, hourly expectation of some kind of translation. With apuzzled look upon his face, he said, suddenly:But, Bishop, how is it that you are left behind, who, of all men in ourmidst, one would have thought would have gone?I had to say last night to him, dear friends, what, with shame andregret, I have to say to you now, that I _ought_ to have known the Truth,and have been prepared, but because I was unconverted, I had failed toapprehend the fact of the Lords near Return.Yet, how often, on the third Sunday in Advent, have I, with many of you,repeated the _Great Truth_, in the collect:O Lord Jesus Christ, who, at Thy first coming, didst send Thy messengerto prepare Thy way before Thee; Grant that the ministers and stewardsof Thy mysteries, may likewise so prepare and make ready Thy way, byturning the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that atThy _second_ coming to judge the world, we may be found an acceptablepeople in Thy sight, who livest and reignest with the Father, and theHoly Spirit, ever one God, world without end. Amen.In the burial of our dead, too, how often have I recited, and have heardthe words,Beseeching Thee that it may please Thee, of Thy gracious goodness,_shortly to accomplish the number of Thine elect_, and to hasten ThyKingdom; that we, _with_ all those that are departed in the True faith ofThy Holy Name, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both in bodyand soul, in Thy eternal and everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ ourLord.Again, the words of Paul in the matter of the Lords Supper TILL HECOME! ought to have opened my eyes. But I confess, with shame, I havebeen blind, a blind leader of the blindVisible emotion checked the Bishops speech, for a moment. Recoveringhimself, he went on:A blind leader of the blind, because unborn of God. I _ought_ to haveknown that Christs Return was near. I _should_ have known it, had I beenspiritually-minded, by the signs of the Apostasy which, (prophesied toprecede the Second Coming of the Lord) have been having their fulfillmentall around us for years.Since last night, I have lived a whole life-time. I have read thewhole of the Gospels and Epistles, and, taking my true place as a lostsoul before God, I have been born of God. And now, here, in this solemnmoment, I bring to you the Spirit-taught knowledge that has been given tome.For a few minutes, he traversed ground already covered in these pages,then, continuing, he said:Last Sunday, when, in all the pride of my office, I preachedpreached inmy unconscious unbeliefI quoted those lines of the poet:    They pass me like shadows, crowds on crowds,    Dim ghosts of men, that hover to and fro,    Hugging their bodies round them like their shrouds      Wherein their souls were buried long ago;    They trampled on their youth, and faith and love,    With Heavens clear messages they madly strove,    And conqueredand their spirits turned to clay....    Alas! poor fools, the anointed eye may trace    A dead souls epitaph in every face.To-day, friends, I know that the anointed eye must have traced Thedead souls epitaph, in my _life_, if not in my face.Now let us face our present position, as those who are _left_! What isthe future to be? This is what you need to know, what I need to know!_First_, let me say, the next thing for each to do is to seek the Lord,to cry unto Him for mercy and pardon, while all our hearts are shockedand startled, and our thoughts are turned God-wards. For unless we closewith God, become His, and live out the future to Him, our portion will bean Eternal Hell.An awful hush rested upon the gathered thousands, as he proceeded:One thing appears very plain from Scripture, that is, that when, lastnight, Christ came into the air and caught up His Church, living anddead, that the Devil, who has been the Prince of the Power of _the air_,had to descend to earth. Christ and Beelzebub can never live together inthe same realm.In the re-creation of this earth, recorded in Genesis, God blessedeverything that He created, _save the atmosphere_, He _did_ not, He_could_ not bless that because Satan, driven from the re-created earth,by the breath of the divine Spirit, had taken refuge _in the air_. He istherefore called in Scripture, not only the _Prince of this World_, butTHE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR.Now, beloved, the Spirit of God has left the earth. The Devil has takenup his abode here with all his myriad agents, and he is going to makeearth as hot for those of us who will witness for God, as is hell itselfto the lost.If we will witness for God during the years we are beginningto-daycalled the years of The Great Tribulation, they will probablybe seven in number, and extend therefore to the dawning moment ofthe Millenniumif we witness therefore for God, I say, during theseintervening seven years, we may expect to meet with hideous trial andsuffering.Antichrist will now soon make himself knownhe will be a _man_, not asystem, mind,he will mislead the Jews, who will now, immediately, returnto their own land, and build their New Temple. For a time, Antichristwill appear to be the friends of the Jews, but he will seek to force themost awful idolatry upon them. The mass of Jewry will accept all this.With the Jew, every Gentile will presently be compelled to acceptAntichrist, and the Roman BeastA sound of protest was heard from a seat near the pulpit, as the Bishopspoke of the Roman Beast. But the preacher took no note of theinterruption and went on:The Devil will be so mad at being cast down out of heaven, and becausehe knows such a very limited time to work against God, that he will callup all hell to stamp out Gods people.For one instant the Bishop paused. He leaned over the pulpit edge, hiseyes were full of the light of a holy determination, but into his voicethere crept a tender yearning, as he continued:Are we prepared for actual martyrdom? For this will certainly be thefate of many who will not bear about upon them the mark of the Beast.Again there came a growl from that seat near the pulpit. But the mostsolemn hush rested upon the vast mass of people.CHAPTER XXX.CONCLUSION.Quietly, giving the impression that the sense of a great shame restedupon him, the Rev.   the noted popular Nonconformist minister rosefrom his seat and faced the congregation.Many of his own church were there. Many others, who had followed thecriticisms of the more spiritual-toned Christian papers, upon his pulpitand other utterances, were there. Every one waited breathless, wonderingwhat contribution he would make to the great matter in hand.It was evident that it was only by the exercise of tremendous will-powerthat he could restrain his emotions sufficiently to speak.God help me, dear friends! he began, for I know now that I have beena Judas to the Lord of Life and Glory, whose _professed_ servant I havebeen. I have gloried in my success; in the crowd that always filled mychurch; in the adulation of my intellectual powers by the Press. ButI have never glorified Christ. In a hundred subtle ways I have deniedmy LordHe _is_ my Lord _now_, I have found Him in the silence of thepast awful night. I have been practically denying His deity for years,I have talked learnedly, when I ought to have been walking humbly,andand.The strain was too much for him, tears streamed down his face, he coveredhis face with his hands, and dropped, sobbing, into his seat.Sobs broke from many of the people. Weeping is infectious. In anothermoment the released pent-up emotions would have become a storm that nonecould have stayed. But the Bishops voice called out,Let us pray!Every head was bent, and a prayer, such as Londons Cathedral had neverheard before, poured from the Bishops lips. The conclusion of the prayerwas followed by a moment or two of deepest stillness.The silence was, suddenly, sharply broken by a full, rich voice crying:Sit up, dear friends! Hear ye the word of the Lord!As the people lifted their heads a cry of amaze rang out from manythroats:The Monk of !The face of the Monk was familiar to all Londoners by his photograph,which beside being on sale in the shops, had appeared again and againin magazines. He had a striking figure, and there was a curiouspicturesqueness about his appearance, with his smooth, clean-shavenface, eagle eyes, tonsured crown, and curious purple-brown cowled habit,girdled with a stout yellow cord about the waist. His bare feet weresandaled. His hands, long, thin, with white tapering fingers, wereoutstretched a moment, then dropped slowly as he went on:These are times when no one of us may shrink from speaking the truthboldly, if the Truth has been committed to us.With all due respect to our friend, Bishop , I would say, that all thesurmises abroad in London, to-day, and those that have been voiced in ourhearing here, during this hour, are wrong!The true meaning of the mysterious disappearance of so manyultra-protestants, is this: The great end _is_ near! Gods work was beingfrustrated by those unholy zealots, who have been therefore graciouslysnatched away to hell, before they could do further mischief.Murmurs of dissent and protest ran through the mass of people, like thelow sullen roar, at sea, of a coming storm.The Bishop thought of his Translated wife. He knew, too, that God notonly indwelt himself, now, but that He had guided him in speaking tothe people. He rose in the pulpit to protest against the words of theRomanist.But a voice cried out from the congregation:Let the Monk have his say. These are strange times, and we would hearall sides before we can judge.And the Monk went on:His supreme Holiness, the Pontiff, had been warned of Godas he is GodsRegent on earthof the event that has happened in our midst. His priestswere warned a few days ago, and in most of our churches, last Sunday,certain dark hints of the coming catastrophe were given. God therefore,now, calls upon you all, through me, to turn to the _true_ church, the_real_ church, the church of St. Peters, the church of Rome.A storm of protesting murmurs rolled up from the people.He waited, smiling confidently a moment. Then he went on:When all the inhabitants of the earth bear upon them the sign of thetrue churchTHE MARK OF THE BEAST! yelled a voice.Another instant and there would have been a hideous uproar, but thateverything became forgotten in a new excitement.From outside, in the street, there rose the roar of a multitude, cryingFire! Fortunately the packed congregation within the Cathedral, oneand all realised that the alarming thing was _out_side, not _in_side thebuilding, so that there was no panic.In a few minutes the great place was cleared. The Bishop, the GreatNonconformist, and a dozen other ministers, and laymen, remained gatheredtogether as by a common instinct, by the pulpit.What is coming, brethren?The _power_ of Antichrist, and the manifestation of The man of Sin,himself, cried the Bishop, solemnly. The Monk of , he went on hasbeen the first to voice the awful claims of this Man of Sin.       *       *       *       *       *A week later!!!Like a sow that returneth to the mire, London, England, the world hadreturned to its old careless life. The fever for sport, pleasure,money-getting, drinking, gambling, licentiousness, was fiercer than ever.Everyone aimed at forgetting what had happened a week beforeand the bulkof the people were succeeding in finding the lethal element.There had been many conversions during the first forty-eight hours_after_ the Translation of the Church, but, since then, scarcely one.Already there had arisen, all over the land, all over the world in fact,as the American, Australasian, and Foreign Press Telegrams made clear, amultitude of men and women who were preaching the maddest, most dangerousdoctrines.Among the most popular, and successful, of these was Spiritualism. Notthe comparatively mild form known _before_ the Great Translation, but anopen, hideous blasphemous exhibition that proved itself to be, what ithad really always been_demonology_.Antichrists sway had begun. Satan was a _positive, active_, agent.The restraints of the Holy Spirit were missing, for _HE_ had left theearth when the Church had been taken away. Other restraints were alsotaken from the midst of the people, since, whether the world recogniseit or not, the fact remains, that the people of God are the Salt, thepreservative of the earth.       *       *       *       *       *Final word! Whether or no, the writer has failed in the purpose he hadwhen he set pen to paper; whether or no he has bungled his subject;whether the reader is, or is not willing to accept the main statementsof the special teaching in this book, does not really affect the realquestion, namely, _The Near Return of our Lord._ His word to us, whetherwe believe and accept it, or whether we slight and reject it, is:BEHOLD I COME QUICKLY! BE YE ALSO READY, FOR IN SUCH AN HOUR AS YETHINK NOT, THE SON OF MAN COMETH.FOR THE LORD HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND FROM HEAVEN.... AND THE DEAD IN CHRISTSHALL RISE FIRST: THEN, WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN, SHALL BE CAUGHTUP TOGETHER WITH THEM IN THE CLOUDS, TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR: AND SOSHALL WE EVER BE WITH THE LORD!                         TO-DAY?                             PERHAPS!The continuation of this Book is published under the title The Mark ofthe Beast.
